3330056 we agree that the arctic national wildlife refuge with its varied and sensitive ecosystems should be preserved in the quest for new sources of energy there are trade offs that pristine area must remain off limits
3330057 n o form of energy is perfect or without trade offs besides if it is acceptable to drill in the caspian sea and in developing countries such as nigeria where environmental concerns are equally important its hard to explain why the united states should rule out drilling off its own coasts

3330076 this post is about the consistency of frameworks consistency is key to a low learning curve if all parts of a framework behave the same way then a developer is less likely to be surprised by behaviors in the framework also i feel that they are less likely to rely on a manual every couple of minutes to look up method names directory names etc given the fact that most if not all mvc frameworks use a front controller pattern there is never a missing file error 404 at the apache level apache is always finding the index php file that kicks off the mvc application
3330077 i think theres a perception these compounds hold untapped potential to help us understand the human mind
3330078 the working hypothesis is that if psilocybin or lsd can occasion these experiences of great personal meaning and spiritual significance then it would allow patients with terminal illnesses hopefully to face their own demise completely differently to restructure some of the psychological angst that so often occurs concurrently with severe disease

3330080 investigators need to be confident that the volunteer could not exit the window if in a delusional state
3330081 the way i view it is we experienced some kind of broad cultural trauma back in the 60s and these drugs became demonised in that context
3330082 as a culture we just decided clinical research shouldnt be done with this class of compounds
3330083 this was partly the federal regulatory authorities it was partly the funding agencies and it was partly the academics themselves leary had so discredited a scientific approach to studying these compounds that anyone who expressed an interest in doing so was automatically discredited
3330084 these drugs these experiences are not for the mystic who wants to sit on the mountain top and meditate they are not for the counter culture rebel they are for everybody
3330085 as the session began and as it built up i felt this lump of emotions welling up and firming up almost like an entity i started to cry a little then it started to dissipate and i started to look at it differently and i think that is the beauty of being able to expand your consciousness i dont think the drug is the cause of these things i think it is a catalyst that allows you to release your own thoughts and feelings from some place that you have bound them to very tightly i began to realise that all of this negative fear and the guilt was such a hindrance to making the most of and enjoying the healthy time that im having however long it may be i was not utilising it to the best and enjoying my life because i was so afraid of what wasnt there yet these substances occur in our natural world and people have been using them for thousands of years to treat physical illness to treat social and behavioural problems

3330115 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3330116 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen
3330117 lin miaoke was the best in this and yang peiyis voice was the most outstanding
3330118 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi

3330120 why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3330121 i can understand why they picked the prettier girl they need to maintain a certain aesthetic beauty during the opening ceremonies this situation is not so bad especially since it gives two people an opportunity to shine rather than just one

3330130 i really felt that as chief justice i had to have the broad shoulders because i knew there would be substantial controversy about it
3330131 most people thought his legacy would be the modernization of the courts

3330133 it isnt anything that i have given any thought to i will do what i should do when that time comes about
3330134 it details the philosophical position of exit that all rational adults should have access to the means of a peaceful death
3330135 she was assessed as someone we were unable to help because of her age and history of psychiatric illness
3330136 her death is a tragedy but not one that exit takes responsibility for
3330137 highlighting the connections between this information and actions taken by erin
3330138 erins behavior in killing herself exactly mirrored information provided in killing me softly
3330139 at the end of the path was a loaded gun provided courtesy of philip nitschke
3330140 it wasnt intended specifically for erin but it was there for her to use regardless
3330141 as someone who watched erin die a long death in a country a long way from home we can say with some clarity that such guarantees should be treated with suspicion
3330142 erin learned in the most horrendous way possible that accepting black and white guarantees from a person who has built a business around the invincibility of a certain suicide method is probably not a wise thing to do
3330143 still under consideration and we hope to have a response soon
3330144 exit can now say with 100 percent confidence that nembutal is widely cheaply and legally available one only needs to know the location of a veterinary supplier and the labeling in use at that location
3330145 on the basis of exit research the best places to visit are the 20 odd border crossings from tijuana in california through to matamoros on the gulf of mexico
3330146 remember though while it is legal to purchase nembutal in mexico it is a crime to import nembutal into most other countries
3330147 we will now be advising our members not to undertake medical testing for alzheimers disease if they think they may wish to end their lives in the future
3330148 test results could be used as they were in this case to make out a murder case against those who love you enough to want to help you to have the choice of a peaceful death
3330149 i think its high time that the authorities took action against dr nitschke
3330150 i would like to see the book withdrawn from sale and the so called euthanasia advice clinics should not be allowed to take place either
3330151 heres this man roaming the country telling people how they can kill themselves how they can gain access to these drugs

3330153 my family has always been left wing pro choice people and before this we assumed nitschke was an okay sounding guy who was advocating for vulnerable people in our community
3330154 this has changed with erins death and after having actually read killing me softly which is a horrifying book containing dangerous information
3330155 we want people to ask in whose interests is this man acting
3330156 there definitely is an energy crisis and i think its affecting every american
3330157 its a shame pelosi is out promoting her book and taking a vacation when there are a lot of her colleagues here trying to hold the flame and bring the message to the american people that we do have an energy crisis and we have to do something about it
3330158 i think its a really reasonable request given that the house wasnt even supposed to adjourn until aug 11 and it just seems rather suspicious that shes out going on a book tour
3330159 as long as we can just have some debate let them vote i think thats a rather reasonable message
3330160 we dont need to depend on anyone else for energy resources

3330203 if youre going to have annual plots it is counterintuitive to have things that have a long life like a shrub or a rose
3330204 these are plots that you are supposed to be growing vegetables in mostly

3330225 flight 406 had to return after the bomb threat no one was injured once the safety of the airplane is confirmed the plane will take off soon said akiko noguchi a spokeswoman for central japan international airport
3330226 so far our database check and preliminary analysis suggest that todays murder suicide was an isolated though brutal murder of one person and assault on two others accompanying the victim
3330227 its hard to put it in words thats not something thats supposed to happen
3330228 i dont know if theres another word for it we said a prayer for them in the locker room i get goosebumps talking about it its something obviously that just changes the events right now for the olympic games
3330229 we dont believe this was targeted at american citizens and we dont believe this has anything to do with the olympics
3330230 we cant neglect the threats from international terrorism forces either
3330231 all levels should sign letters of responsibility with management objectives get clear of their responsibilities one by one study the measures to implement task by task and assign tasks unit by unit individual by individual
3330232 its as if the whole society has been put on duty
3330233 with leaflets distributed everywhere telling us that if we see suspicious people or people coming to beijing to appeal or people passing out leaflets we have to report them
3330234 transport is really inconvenient if you go out maybe youre a little busy and you forget your id that means big trouble theres a sign on our street that says report any foreigners to the police and there are leaflets stipulating all kinds of rules they are scared that city residents will tell foreigners about the real situation here were all put under a lot of pressure
3330235 its as if a national disaster is upon us the authorities response is if you are inconvenienced please understand its just like during the sars period society has been sealed up with restrictions on movement and interaction people who come in from outside have to apply and register

3330237 over the past nine years the ccp has used a variety of inaccurate labels on falun gong in each case the aim has been to vilify people who practice falun gong and therefore justify the horrors these people are subject to under ccp rule
3330238 there exists sadly a real possibility that the ccp would attempt to stage or attribute a disruptive act with the intent to pin it on falun gong
3330239 i witnessed on a daily basis the unremitting vilification of falun gong and falun gong practitioners in all areas of the chinese print and television
3330240 it was the most extreme and unjustified campaign of unmitigated hatred i have ever witnessed
3330241 anyone who participates in an organized act of violence in the name of falun gong is by the very act itself not a falun gong practitioner and certainly does not represent the community of falun gong practitioners
3330242 in all our efforts to regain our basic freedoms over the past nine years we have never engaged in acts that intentionally harm innocent people
3330243 the foundation of our faith is the principles of honesty compassion and tolerance and we aim to follow these in everything we do even when exposing the abuses meted out by the ccp
3330244 today there were again four german reporters coming to film near the state letters and complaints reception office according to the requirement of the central party conference office and state letters and complaints office local interceptors are strictly prohibited from staying near the central and state letter and complaints offices so as to avoid being sighted by overseas reporters relevant personnel will be held accountable for causing negative influence
3330245 the landlord and a group of others raided her house no chairs no stools documents have been removed everything is missing
3330246 that place actually does not deal with any applications at all they try to persuade you not to take this action
3330247 they do not let us take this way but ask us to go through the channel of appeal to resolve our problems they are all cheating us the grassroots people
3330248 some reporters seemed to try to do interviews but were stopped by them the reporters wanted to see if there were people lodging applications and the results but they were barred from entering
3330249 there appeared to be more security personnel than visitors at the park
3330250 designating unilaterally protest zones for demonstrators does not equate to respecting the right to demonstrate because in this situation control comes first and the right second
3330251 we must bid farewell to autocracy whatever shape it takes whatever justification it gives authoritarian government always ends up trampling on equality denying justice and stealing happiness and laughter from the people
3330252 china has endured disasters suffering humiliation and a darkness that made people hopeless
3330253 we do not have an open media even though freedom of expression is more valuable than life itself
3330254 today is not the time to dwell on our problems but neither should we accept those who tell us these games are not political
3330255 they imply that this fortnight of sport is somehow disconnected from history and psychology unrelated to theory and morality and on a more elevated plane than base human nature
3330256 they argue that anyone who links the games with politics has sinister ulterior motives that they are anti chinese
3330257 the bodies were swiftly removed by police who sealed off accident scenes with orange tape and cleared other workers from the area while the dead were loaded into police vehicles
3330258 the lawbreakers drove a taxi to the local public security office industry and business administration and other sites and tossed homemade explosives destroying two police vehicles
3330259 our leaders havent determined the nature of the incident yet
3330260 i dont know exactly what happened but whatever it was will make them even more worried about stability
3330261 want to use the platform of the olympics to amplify the effects
3330262 we are going to strengthen the security at scenic spots to make sure no sharp weapons can be brought into the area
3330263 beijing is a safe city but unfortunately we are not immune to violent acts
3330264 i would like to express my heartfelt sympathy to you and the family of the victims over this unfortunate incident
3330265 we are absolutely devastated by what has occurred for their loss and for everything they are going through
3330266 it is tragic for the family concerned but it wont change our plans this really could happen anywhere
3330267 but i am going to be staying with my tour group though as it is when you go off on your own you could get trouble
3330268 in moscow there is no way i would walk at night as i do here
3330269 i dont want people to judge my wife just based on this
3330270 theres a lot more to my wife than just this my wife has done good her whole life now this its a nightmare
3330271 it could have been you it could have been your sisters
3330272 this could happen to any woman who has a baby
3330273 im disappointed that the prosecutors office felt it was necessary to bring charges that require a mandatory minimum 13 years on the three firearms charges in prison if convicted
3330274 i believe when this case is ultimately tried and all the facts are brought before the court no jury or judge would feel that any jail time is warranted in this case
3330275 at this point i think its her attorneys obligation to put forth any sort of mitigating evidence if they want us to consider it
3330276 no no pets in our room they are hard to live with in our small room that is already messy enough with your courteousness i will not allow a pet in our room no

3330280 why would anyone want to pay 65 000 bucks leave alone 5 lakh to sit among a bunch of air bubbles when one could achieve the same result by eating a lot of dal and sitting in a maamuli 2 000 rupee bathtub like the one we have now
3330281 at this rate well have to pop up our whole room and get ourselves a new one in keeping with that damn jacuzzi
3330282 if we pop up our house wherell we go live

3330317 my responsibility is to encourage people to dig latrines to wash their hands with soap after visiting the latrine
3330318 most people do have soap you can buy slices of soap for a small amount of money
3330319 that means they must wash their jerry cans every day use one scoop for pouring store water in clay pots wash them every two to three days and cover the clay pots
3330320 they say it is too far for them to walk and the bicycle taxi costs too much
3330321 we are also collecting data in the population for amref

3330323 the vht came to the village and talked to us about health now i have a pit latrine and i have a bath shelter i have a hand washing facility next to the latrine all my five children are using this before it was two and a half miles to the borehole and sometimes one of us had to go to the borehole three times a day to fetch the water we needed each trip took two hours but i want my daughters to go to school for their future life now the borehole is only half a mile away from my home now we have very great things here and i am very grateful
3330324 we need a bicycle ambulance so that we can take people to the clinic at atiri when they need to go we need a health centre near here and we need storage kits for drugs the vhts were given medicines but there are none left now
3330325 we have a great opportunity to start with what was promised but never delivered
3330326 many of the people who would be eligible for the program dont want to have anything to do with us
3330327 its going to take a lot of hard work and outreach to find these people
3330328 so i think its a little unfounded that there will be this flood of people who crowd everyone else out
3330329 but because this is a problem here in san francisco it obligates us to correct our past

3330418 boris johnson has urged david cameron to follow his lead and adopt his social reform agenda for an incoming government making his administration a model for national tory policy
3330419 london is not a petri dish for tory policies says johnson
3330420 meant to be the petri dish into which tory central office is introducing the bacillus of their policies
3330421 we are developing a lot of new things and i hope that they are broadly congruent with things that conservatives might like to do when they get into office
3330422 it is not only much much better than i thought it would be its much bigger and its a completely hands on job you cannot be mayor without being mayor you take lots of direct and immediate decisions that affect what happens in london and sometimes i will say things in this room in the course of a discussion about whatever it happens to be and forget about it for the rest of the afternoon and then ill turn on the tv news later on and it will be reported and thats for someone who has been on the other side of the fence for a very long time that is an extraordinary privilege
3330423 i dont want to give the impression that im constantly on the blower to gordon
3330424 i am willing to be more reasonable to londoners by allowing us to pay on account rather than being whacked every time you have a fine

3330431 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3330432 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3330433 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3330434 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3330435 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3330436 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3330437 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3330438 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

3330472 i wish to reiterate my governments position that the islamic republic of iran has no intention to attack any other nation

3330518 it appears that for people who have a certain genetic makeup the initial physical reaction to smoking can play a significant role in determining what happens next
3330519 if cigarette smoking is sustained nicotine addiction can occur in a few days to a few months
3330520 the finding of a genetic association with pleasurable early smoking experiences may help explain how people get addicted and of course once addicted many will keep smoking for the rest of their lives
3330521 understanding the genetics of complex disorders such as nicotine addiction will require much more research on key traits

3330523 its exciting because weve found a compound in nature that may one day surpass a currently marketed drug or could become the structural template for rationally designed drugs with improved selectivity
3330524 the ocean is a genetically distinct environment and the single most diverse source of new molecules to be discovered
3330525 we have only scratched the surface of the chemical diversity in the ocean
3330526 developing an accurate model of ice would help architects civil engineers and environmental engineers understand what happens to structures and systems exposed to freezing conditions
3330527 it could also help us understand and better predict the movement of glaciers
3330528 but they just stop where they happen to lie in different configurations throughout the crystal with no correlation between them and no single one lowers the energy enough to take over and reduce the entropy to zero
3330529 the original spin ice research went from one part of the periodic table to a more flexible one
3330530 but artificial spin ice goes off the periodic table altogether
3330531 it mimics the behavior of real ice but is completely designable with specific properties
3330532 we can change the strength of the spin or reformulate the alloy to change the magnetic properties which creates new bulk properties that we either couldnt get from normal materials or couldnt control at the atomic level
3330533 this is the first time the rules of ice behavior have ever been rigorously confirmed by directly counting pseudo hydrogen atoms
3330534 we can track the position and movement of each pseudo atom in our model see where defects occur in the lattice and simulate what happens over much longer periods of time
3330535 our meta material is very similar to patterned hard disk media magnetic bits used in hard drives are usually placed at random but memory density could be increased if they were in a tight regular pattern instead
3330536 weve found that both hydrogen in ice and the pseudo hydrogen in our artificial spin ice also behave as bits can carry information and interact with each other perhaps in the future engineers will be inspired by this in their hard drive designs the formal patterning and bit interactions may actually help to stabilize information ultimately leading to drives with much higher capacities

3330588 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3330589 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

3330593 advance praise in the rodale release of the 192 page book with 110 pictures
3330594 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3330595 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3330596 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3330597 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3330598 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3330609 we have decided to work together because it is the right thing to do to move the community forward
3330610 my phone has been ringing off the hook to zone it as residential
3330611 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored
3330612 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3330613 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3330614 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3330615 cable one customers opted in to our monitoring of their internet usage and content consistent with this third party test when they agreed to our acceptable use policy
3330616 giving people information in the acceptable use policy is just giving them notice
3330617 when pixar started there was no cg industry so we were in manufacturing
3330618 i hope the siggraph experience will help me better propel myself into the industry and hopefully help me be fully employed
3330619 i had a scholarship to vfs last year but couldnt make it up to canada this year siggraph is a great step forward for me
3330620 siggraph is honored to host this special advance screening at the festival
3330621 the star wars films have always been stellar examples of visionary visual effects seeing these effects paired with computer animation and the behind the scenes knowledge from dave filoni will be an incredible experience for fans and film professionals alike
3330622 as the field of computer graphics matures we will continue to see graphics practitioners take on novel challenges that were not even considered just a few years ago
3330623 the modeling and animation techniques used in spore will inspire others to think more creatively about user created content in computer games
3330624 i started with the soundtrack by mixing and re pitching various abstract sounds that i recorded
3330625 the idea being to create music from noises then i procedurally animated numerous abstract 3d objects to the track these animations are then used as source imagery to my 3d noise shaders which have parameters that animate to the soundtrack as well the camera travels through the resulting animated evolving volume i went back and forth between the sound and visuals as i would stumble upon cool moments in each and wanted to tie them together so that every sound event had a visual event and vice versa
3330626 one of the really interesting sets of papers are on what i characterize as gradient based illustration techniques
3330627 they offer very powerful techniques for image creation and editing the applications are as compelling as painting i expect these ideas to move from academia to the artist within a couple years
3330628 who would have guessed that face manipulation would be a trend this year
3330629 we look for novelty technical advancements the highest quality results
3330630 and the wow factor some people do things youd never think of like the bizarre self animating image
3330631 one that im excited about is a piece on digital cinematography
3330632 we have pixar and blue sky giving their approaches to cinematography and setting up camera rigs for wall e and horton and some work from ilm on their digital environments in indiana jones its an eye cracker on monday morning at 8 30 but ill be there and friday is character td day
3330633 someone could come in cold not knowing anything about stereo 3d and come out with an appreciation for the history and technical challenges
3330634 a fairly large group of us were having lunch during the jury meeting for the content of siggraph 08 and one person lamented that at the conference we go absorb information sit passively and listen and then leave were not creating anything we in this case refers to the research community so we talked about it
3330635 its totally freeform but i imagine people will exchange information at the meeting arrange to meet and in the meantime think about the problem
3330636 well give them problems that are grand in nature not something you could solve by writing a paper
3330637 this is a process that starts four years in advance and requires macro and micro management skills
3330638 also the roles that the chair has to fill are mind bogglingly vast
3330639 she has to be a visionary a strategist and a hands on implementer as well as a leader a manager a mentor and a friend all while holding down a day job thankfully the amazing conference team of volunteers and contractors makes meeting that impossibly tall order a possibility
3330640 we have an excellent collection of robotics demos and of course takeo kanade is a featured speaker presenting
3330641 its programmed as a true festival with not only screenings but also production sessions festival talks an entire 3d stereo cinematography track production studio evenings and a festival awards session
3330642 los angeles is really an incredibly popular city with attendees
3330643 that would be like saying the people who contribute and attend could grow to have too much passion and enthusiasm for their work
3330644 when i started my research position less than two years ago i was already deep into the conference planning cycle for 2008 and my managers have been extremely supportive
3330645 one of the exciting projects that they asked me to join within my first months was an academy of technology study on the future of research we interviewed researchers and lab directors both internal and external to ibm in industry and academia we asked them what they saw on the horizon for the next 10 years not just in terms of research topics but also in terms of the way people will be working in research environments our findings were very rich and we aim to publish our final report at the end of this year
3330646 we wanted to keep whats worked in the past but also push ourselves by making a more a festival environment for cg
3330647 it was really kinda supposed to be a quick peek
3330648 but as is the nature of a rabbitholes display once you turn the lights on well i warned him this place was going to go crazy
3330649 many of these cutting edge technologies exemplify how our past informs our future and how it affects the upcoming opportunities and challenges of computer graphics and interactive techniques
3330650 the technologies and installations in new tech demos encourage people to engage with the future as well as celebrate our past as we invigorate explore and define our potential
3330651 exactly where you are this is my herd well it was my mates herd
3330652 ryalu that is enough from you i am sorry i was exhausted and i got lost i never should have left please forgive me
3330653 she should not many predators here much less during the day
3330654 stop this ryalu she is a friend she helped me get back here
3330655 early to rise early to bed makes a man healthy but socially dead
3330656 i was innocent and wise in that land far away
3330657 major milestone in its commitment to be the greenest technology company on the planet
3330658 inflation is impacting on the economy differently in different sectors
3330659 motorists can see there is seven to eight pence difference per litre in the price of diesel between petrol stations across the country
3330660 this is just a rip off action must be taken against this profiteering
3330661 action must also be taken to stop damaging speculation in the oil market if action is not taken it is inevitable that wages will have to rise
3330662 this is a really disturbing set of data that will not go down at all well at the bank of england
3330663 when i sent in my first tape to the head of gramophone programmes at the bbc i had made the fatal mistake of forgetting to rewind it to the start
3330664 yet that gentleman took the time to wind it all the way back and once hed listened to it things went from there
3330665 i can tell you if i was a young chap coming over from ireland today they probably wouldnt even listen to my tape let alone rewind it
3330666 somehow that old fashioned thoroughness and commitment have disappeared i suppose no one has the time for it any more
3330667 when i started people who worked for the bbc knew they werent earning as much as people in commercial television but they did have the satisfaction of knowing that they worked for one of the finest if not the finest broadcasting organisation in the whole world
3330668 im not sure they feel that any more or at least that it means as much as it used to
3330669 the only way the uk will ever regain any respectability is if we get a major british star robbie williams take that god knows there are enough of them to represent us and then people will have to vote for us
3330670 i was considering giving up before belgrade and now i have to say im very doubtful about ever wanting to do eurovision again
3330671 will not go down at all well at the bank
3330672 the rise in consumer price inflation to a series high of 4 4 per cent in july was well above expectations furthermore the rise cannot be attributed solely to sharply higher food and energy prices worryingly core inflation spiked up to 1 9 per cent in july from 1 6 per cent in june which raises concern that higher energy and food prices are increasingly having second round inflationary effects
3330673 the inflation figures are a further headache for the bank of england which is torn between the imperative to tame inflation and the need to provide a stimulus to the wider economy but so far the market response to the inflation numbers has been pretty sanguine
3330674 just a few weeks ago the ftse 100 was flirting with 5 000 but now it is 500 or so points higher if the ftse 100 closes higher today then it confirms the recent bullish run and suggests the market is happy to shrug off bad news how long that mood will last remains to be seen
3330675 h1 first half eps earnings per share is 2 per cent ahead of forecast and the results demonstrate good growth due to a strong recovery in contribution from the owned and leased properties growth was slower in the managed and franchised hotels but their ebit earnings before interest and tax still increased by 9 per cent we believe ihgs longer term prospects are underpinned by a strong pipeline and the 28k rooms signed in the most recent quarter suggest that developer interest in ihgs brands remains strong
3330676 the background is that indian law precludes foreign direct investment in multi brand retail although international retailers have been striking franchise and partnership agreements with local retailers and industrial conglomerates to allow entry to what is expected to be a large and fast growing market over the coming years
3330677 the continued dominance of wholesale versus consumer banking profits is set to reduce overall returns for the group with pressures on the groups capital position likely to necessitate a sharp slowdown in asset growth or the need to raise equity at some stage although standard chartered operates in regions where economic growth has remained resilient rising inflationary pressure in asia represents a risk to this scenario we believe this will act as a cap on the groups rating with earnings potentially disappointing as asset growth slows next year
3330678 a few more like that and it will be the way to go
3330679 the olympics are all about personal bests and for me it was probably a personal best today
3330680 i think i have a bit of a speed advantage
3330681 these are my conditions and if we get some more im expecting to be right up there
3330682 theres no way you can sail conservatively out there you just have to react to whats happened
3330683 im more emotionally affected and that has taken a bit out of me but im not down about today
3330684 my coach and i discussed it and its about getting your head back up its a case of bouncing back
3330685 your back still hurts most days and youre tired constantly but i am fitter than i have ever been and i think the way i sailed today was the best i have ever sailed
3330686 excellent songwriting incredible musicianship and a band tightness that only symbaloo
3330687 delivers the sort of intelligent melodic pop music that ought to be a staple of radio playlists
3330688 lush instrumental flourishes intriguing sound bites and naturalistic found sounds
3330689 soulful voice experimental instrumentation and an encyclopedic knowledge of pop music
3330690 its all about using the loan for the right reason and paying it back as agreed
3330691 i picked it up wrapped it and never even noticed
3330692 she opened it on christmas morning she put it on and our son noticed it was wrong
3330693 we go to about three games a year and no one ever even mentioned it
3330694 el sistema no puede sostener 2 5 millones de trabajadores p blicos

3330697 el sistema no puede sostener 2 5 millones de trabajadores p blicos
3330698 when i heard about it i felt really hurt inside
3330699 i cannot believe a writer could write something like that its the not the way that we want to be portrayed we have feelings we dont like the word retard we are people were just like any other people out there we want to be ourselves and not be discriminated against
3330700 there were parts of the movie where i laughed but it seems to me that the movie tried really hard to go too far and then pull back on everything that was offensive except the issue of people with intellectual disabilities i just think ben stiller and the people involved in this movie just didnt think it was going to be offensive
3330701 no changes or cuts to the film will be made
3330702 libanon dess folk dess arm och dess motst ndsr relse har r tt att befria sitt land
3330703 none of these cuts are likely to happen because government budgeting is more of political exercise than a logical one
3330704 while sales during the second quarter increased from the same period last year profitability decreased
3330705 given strongcos lower than expected operating results challenging market conditions and the need to position the fund for the future the trustees decided to suspend distributions
3330706 we are fully aware of the importance of distributions to our unitholders however the fund needs to conserve cash to maintain balance sheet strength and meet operating requirements
3330707 the deteriorating economic outlook for the euro zone and elsewhere is now having an impact after the market had become used to weakness in the u s economy
3330708 it continues with the theme weve been seeing from bank executives where theyre talking about no signs of real improvement in terms of the economic and financial trends
3330709 because we talk about bringing the best of invesco to our clients we will look at things like launching powershares and look at all of our investment capabilities around the globe
3330710 we dont have a heavy commodity weighting in our funds so it would make sense to launch etfs that were tied to specific energy sectors or commodities
3330711 we now operate as a single investment management firm with distinct investment centres around the globe
3330712 presumably if the financial crisis moves into the background hard to imagine then gold could pull back to its uptrend which currently lies just below 800
3330713 any time the ratio has got down to 10 times or under it has recovered to at least 15 times within a minimum of three years
3330714 muy muy contenta no tengo palabras para describir este momento han sido momentos dif ciles de mucho trabajo han sido quince a os de estar entrenando todos los d as pero en este momento puedo decir que vali la pena todo el esfuerzo
3330715 estoy feliz de estar aqu junto a tatiana y poder obtener una medalla que tanto hab amos esperado
3330716 sab amos a lo que ven amos cu les eran las posibilidades reales que ten amos y al final hicimos un buen trabajo tanto ella como yo y estuvimos en la pelea
3330717 tanto ella como ya sabemos que los dos primeros no fueron nuestros mejores clavados pero los tres ltimos son los que mejor tiramos y los de mayor dificultad
3330718 muchos a os hemos estado as entonces no pasa nada cada una ha hecho su trabajo y esperemos que a la que sea que le vaya muy bien
3330719 du bernie pass mal auf was force india 2009 alles zeigen kann
3330720 force india hat ganz klar unter beweis gestellt dass sie aufholen und sich verbessern k nnen
3330721 es geht nicht nur darum den r ckstand von der vergangenen saison aufzuholen es geht eher um die vergangenen drei jahre und wir haben definitiv aufgeholt auch wenn die formel 1 noch so wettbewerbsf hig ist und das ist eine gute sache
3330722 wir haben das getriebe ohne zugkraftunterbrechung in budapest nicht eingesetzt werden es aber in valencia einf hren soweit ich das beurteilen kann stellen wir damit dann die entwicklungen f r 2008 ein und konzentrieren uns von nun an ausschlie lich darauf ein konkurrenzf higes auto f r 2009 auf die beine zu stellen
3330723 die erfahrung von giancarlo ist nicht aufzuwiegen und adrian hat sehr viel talent meiner meinung nach wird er in jedem rennen besser und konstanter
3330724 ich bin mit den beiden sehr zufrieden und was noch viel wichtiger ist ihre einstellung wird uns helfen die herausforderungen von morgen zu meistern ich denke dass sie sehr zufrieden damit sein werden das 2009er auto zu fahren ich bin absolut davon berzeugt dass es ein bedeutender vorschritt und eine gro e berraschung sein wird
3330725 youre looking at a cinematic device employed by zhang yimou here this is actually almost animation
3330726 we said earlier that aspects of this opening ceremony are almost like cinema in real time well this is quite literally cinematic
3330727 heres some animation to give you a more vivid sense of what theyre seeing out there
3330728 the cabinet committee on influx cci had submitted the report during the previous mda government and the present mpa government is examining it for a final decision on the matter
3330729 if we find an easy agreement maybe we can finish our discussions but it may take another meeting after that to get together
3330730 we have a small number of countries worried about non proliferation if we can get over that we are over the hill
3330731 that will also depend on what kind of persuasion the us france and others can bring to bear
3330732 they have understood india is unique in many ways we are hopeful further efforts are being made before nsg consultation process and much of the support which has come is many people see india as a country with a future one already on the scene
3330733 continuing inflationary pressures indicate persistence of the tight monetary stance growth is slowing slightly but the main concern is the worsening fiscal situation as subsidies are used to suppress inflation
3330734 with countries allowing domestic fuel prices to increase even partially there is little question that as long as oil prices remain at current levels or even decline moderately the price adjustments will keep up the pressure on inflation rates across the region this puts the spotlight on monetary policy
3330735 we will also hold an international conference during that week in which eminent personalities associated with media and entertainment from various countries will be discussing various aspects of the industry especially its contribution to overall economic development of the region
3330736 they would be encouraged to bring out a compendium of information on locations facilities and other assistance for film shootings
3330737 we feel the life of 483 families at the two sea side villages in kendrapara district is in danger
3330738 there was good evidence that either cell type could be the origin of medulloblastomas but no one considered that both sets of evidence could be correct and that these tumours could actually begin in two different cell types
3330739 identifying the normal cell that gives rise to a tumour is important because it allows direct comparisons between tumour cells and their normal counterparts so that key differences and vulnerabilities in tumour can be identified
3330740 also recent studies suggest that cells resembling the original cell may persist in mature tumours and can be critical in ensuring its survival if so these cells would be an excellent target for treatment
3330741 it has always been thought that cells had to mutate several times before becoming a tumour
3330742 we have agreed to phase out duties on crude oil over a period of time for brunei and not for any other country
3330743 the government will take steps to engage all the groups concerned from jammu as well as the kashmir valley in talks so that the issues could be resolved amicably to the satisfaction of all concerned
3330744 i condemn this terrorist attack that targeted us and this is not the first attempt
3330745 is not going to sway us from continuing our course of imposing security through operation good omen
3330746 we must capture or kill the hard core terrorists that are residing now out in the hinterlands
3330747 when it comes to the crisis in our housing market they seem intent on making things worse rather than better
3330748 their decision to brief out the possibility of a stamp duty holiday was completely reckless
3330749 far from bringing up the housing market theyve actually frozen it and this tells you everything you need to know about the government press handling and headlines above what is in the best interests of the country
3330750 we wont be announcing any conclusions today we wont be briefing our thoughts today this is a seminar to look at the issues its to engage with the experts to help us develop our policies
3330751 yet another worrying signal for families desperately trying to make ends meet
3330752 the most important concern up and down the country is the deteriorating state of our economy
3330753 hundreds of thousands of families now have the threat of negative equity hanging over them businesses are cutting back unemployment is creeping up and this mornings inflation figures are yet another worrying signal for families desperately trying to make ends meet
3330754 after everything weve heard from the prime minister about his fantastic economic record rpi inflation is 5 today it was 2 6 in 1997 and cpi is 4 4 today and it was 1 6 in 1997
3330755 that is not a good record and people are beginning to see that this decade of this chancellor now prime ministers conduct has not been that effective
3330756 history has shown time and time again that if you leave aggression to go unchecked you only store up graver problems for the future

3330761 the first six months of 2008 were in line with expectations but not satisfactory
3330762 our subsidiary affilinet achieved strong sales growth while sales of adlink media were only slightly up on the prior year figure as expected sales in our domain marketing segment sedo were down on the previous year also in the second quarter sedo continues to suffer from negative effects which were already reported in the first quarter of 2008 these effects result from permanent changes in policy and algorithms which our most important partners in the search engine business have made the continuing weakness of the us dollar and the uk pound is also reflected in these figures
3330763 the importance of online advertising will continue to grow although it is not free of influence from economic fluctuations
3330764 against this backdrop we will strengthen our performance marketing solutions which are less dependent on general economic factors and will focus increasingly on new technologies to optimize process efficiency
3330765 das erste halbjahr 2008 entspricht unseren erwartungen es war aber nicht zufrieden stellend
3330766 unsere tochter affilinet konnte den umsatz deutlich steigern w hrend adlink media nur eine leichte steigerung gegen ber dem vorjahr zeigt im domain marketing sedo blieb der umsatz erwartungsgem auch im zweiten quartal hinter dem vorjahr zur ck sedo ist nach wie vor von negativen effekten betroffen die bereits im ersten quartal 2008 berichtet wurden dabei handelt es sich um dauerhafte nderungen bei policy und algorithmen die unsere wichtigsten partner im suchmaschinen bereich vorgenommen haben au erdem schl gt sich die anhaltende schw che des dollar und des britischen pfundes in den zahlen nieder
3330767 die bedeutung der online werbung wird weiter zunehmen auch wenn sie nicht unbeeinflusst von konjunkturellen schwankungen bleibt
3330768 vor diesem hintergrund st rken wir unsere weniger konjunkturabh ngigen performancemarketing l sungen und setzen verst rkt neue technologien zur optimierung der prozesseffizienz ein f r den weiteren verlauf des gesch ftsjahres sind wir zuversichtlich und best tigen unsere mai prognose f r 2008 wir erwarten ein umsatzwachstum von 10 im konzern und ein vorsteuerergebnis in etwa auf dem niveau des vorjahres ohne sondereffekte d h von rund 21 mio eur

3330810 obviously i felt the pressure but i kept my mind free during the competition
3330811 so far there has yet to be any report specifying whether the three victims in asahan were positively or negatively infected with the bird flu virus if the results are positive we will have to monitor the area longer
3330812 we are on full alert to monitor developments of a bird flu outbreak in asahan a team from the world health organization is still there to investigate the case
3330813 the three people died following the discovery of dead poultry but we dont know whether or not it was the cause
3330814 we have so far carried out various anticipatory measures to curb the virus spread and we urge people to remain alert
3330815 were quite upset as well this is not how we have our protocol set up with our producers
3330816 they have to deal with large scale suppliers the infrastructure of that supply mechanism has the same potential for contamination as conventional meat
3330817 we tend to look at whole foods not only as more nutritious but also safer and were willing to pay a premium for that
3330818 this is a fantastic opportunity and i am really looking forward to embracing laras world

3330822 well i actually did pitch a batman film when warner bros began developing batman begins and it wasnt what they did but the vibe was very similar

3330824 in my version there was actually a new villain it wasnt one of the classics which is probably why they didnt use it it was more of a hannibal lector type he was somebody already in arkham asylum that bruce went and sort of studied with
3330825 it was a whole thing i get very emotional about it i still love the story maybe ill get to do it as a comic one day
3330826 many live roaches on the food equipment coolers dishes and other areas
3330827 the port handled over 30 million tons in 2007 the fifteenth consecutive year of growth in throughput
3330828 dublin port is the port of choice for irelands importers and exporters
3330829 over 80 of imports arriving at dublin port are consumer goods destined for retail outlets in the city and surrounding areas
3330830 as irelands premier port notwithstanding the current economic slowdown we will keep planning for growth in the medium and long term to ensure that we can continue to facilitate trade when the upturn in the economy arrives
3330831 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3330832 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3330833 the iaaf is sending a clear message that we will not tolerate doping said lamine diack the president of track and fields governing body
3330834 certainly the iaaf action sends a strong message she said
3330835 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored
3330836 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3330837 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3330838 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3330839 when it comes to the crisis in our housing market they seem intent on making things worse rather than better
3330840 their decision to brief out the possibility of a stamp duty holiday was completely reckless
3330841 far from bringing up the housing market theyve actually frozen it and this tells you everything you need to know about the government press handling and headlines above what is in the best interests of the country
3330842 we wont be announcing any conclusions today we wont be briefing our thoughts today this is a seminar to look at the issues its to engage with the experts to help us develop our policies
3330843 yet another worrying signal for families desperately trying to make ends meet
3330844 the most important concern up and down the country is the deteriorating state of our economy
3330845 hundreds of thousands of families now have the threat of negative equity hanging over them businesses are cutting back unemployment is creeping up and this mornings inflation figures are yet another worrying signal for families desperately trying to make ends meet
3330846 after everything weve heard from the prime minister about his fantastic economic record rpi inflation is 5 today it was 2 6 in 1997 and cpi is 4 4 today and it was 1 6 in 1997
3330847 that is not a good record and people are beginning to see that this decade of this chancellor now prime ministers conduct has not been that effective
3330848 history has shown time and time again that if you leave aggression to go unchecked you only store up graver problems for the future
3330849 athletes may speak about political issues but if they do so will not be entitled to any financial gain through winnings from gold silver or bronze medals

3330852 in the history of the business i dont think its ever been tougher for producers
3330853 the market is changing and studios are always looking for con financing opportunities
3330854 the producers skill set is going to have to include the ability to bring in financing from overseas sources like dubai china india and other parts of asia
3330855 he once promised would be a model for the nation under an edwards presidency reports the news observer
3330856 these factors may promote the long term use of proton pump inhibitors leaving patients at increased risk of osteoporosis related fractures
3330857 this is an extremely rare case of co infection in a controlled monogamous relationship which showed us how a strong immune system in the elite suppressor kept the virus from replicating and infecting other cells
3330858 our findings offer hope to vaccine researchers because they reveal that the immune systems primary offense known as cd8 killer t cells can effectively halt disease progression by a pathogenic form of hiv
3330859 moreover the strength of the immune response was not dependent on infection by a weakened form of the virus and if we can harness the means by which these elite white blood cells stop the virus then we can hopefully teach or reprogram white blood cells in others to also target hiv
3330860 the presence of this genetic spot is a discordant result that strongly contradicts theories that various genetic factors alone play a protective role in suppression
3330861 elite suppression offers clues to vaccine researchers on many fronts how cd8 killer t cells can attack hiv and how a stronger immune response can force hiv into a permanent defensive state
3330862 this month we have seen the highest annual price increase on the staples basket since april this year this indicates that shoppers need to keep an even closer eye on what theyre spending
3330863 no matter how this conflict started russia has escalated it well beyond the dispute over south ossetia and invaded another country
3330864 russia has escalated its military campaign through strategic bombing and the movement of its ground forces into the heart of georgia there is no possible justification for these attacks

3330880 we knew they were going to go crack heads we told them again and again not to do this
3330881 we thought we had an understanding with the russians that any response would be south ossetia focused clearly its not
3330882 no we did not receive any money back from the obama campaign at any time

3330885 es una posibilidad que no est descartada es una opci n que est sobre la mesa ahora bien siempre que podamos evitar un derramamiento de sangre lo evitaremos no obstante si vuelven a imponernos nuevamente la guerra como ya hicieron en 1975 el pueblo saharaui no s lo est decidido sino que est preparado para luchar y defender sus derechos en la forma que le sea posible con las armas en la mano si fuera necesario
3330886 tragically and unfortunately these latest complaints vindicate the serious recommendations we made years ago
3330887 we issued a scathing report that left no doubt about this physician arbitrarily denying medically necessary care to patients
3330888 dr benet devised a plan to bilk pmi of its assets and profit personally
3330889 this report presents a picture of a physician driven by the promise of wealth to disregard health needs
3330890 if you look at the consent decree it really comes down to technical documentation issues
3330891 in neither case did any harm come to the patient from anything i did or didnt do
3330892 i couldnt walk i couldnt talk i was not a good mother i couldnt function
3330893 i lost my daughter i lost my career i lost my home
3330894 i had lost any self respect that i had ever had and i lost my freedom i misplaced myself
3330895 i had tried i dont know how many times to quit drugs before i got arrested
3330896 when you lose everything that i had lost and when you recognize you have fallen so far you are going to consider using drugs until you die or you are going to change i wasnt ready to die
3330897 what we do is prevent more people from going into prison and more people from creating crime on the street
3330898 these were not reductions that he wanted to make but reductions he had to make to be the responsible party
3330899 many of these calls we are getting are from people who have finally reached a point where they want to change their lives
3330900 this program has been the difference between life and death for me
3330901 i really dont know if i would be clean today if i didnt have this help
3330902 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored
3330903 we must draw up a rapid calendar so that each side can go back to the positions of before the crisis
3330904 just one house thats all thats keeping my children away from the facility thats going to be providing services to the mentally ill
3330905 but we still talked to many of the neighbors to let them know what were doing
3330906 the chance my kids are being put at risk and no ones asking me drives a wedge
3330907 we dont anticipate that our tenants will be roaming the neighborhood or causing any disruptions whatsoever
3330908 we had a similar facility in st petersburg which is located even closer to a daycare its been open for over a year and weve had no problems or incidents at that facility
3330909 i have reached a decision to halt the operation to force the georgian authorities to peace
3330910 the aggressor has been punished and has incurred very significant losses its armed forces are disorganized
3330911 the statement on the halt of the military action by russia is the news we had expected its good news
3330912 at circuit city we are committed to providing our customers with the very best home entertainment experience this football season
3330913 the circuit city fanalyst youtube channel provides a new way for us to engage our core customer base and to challenge them to become part of our online community through the join the squad contest
3330914 we are constantly striving to create an easy to use revolutionary product for our clients
3330915 cherokee county is fairly liberal in determining what people in the county need and trying to provide those services
3330916 there are too many people in the criminal justice system who shouldnt be there
3330917 i dont know what to call it now a catastrophe or armageddon
3330918 were at a crossroads and looking to the county just to break even
3330919 decides it cant help fund us we are dropping the service
3330920 by october its possible we could be out of it
3330921 the biggest treatment centers today are our hospital emergency rooms and our jails
3330922 its easily costing us hundreds of thousands of dollars annually
3330923 sitting in an acute care hospital is not the answer for these patients
3330924 putting people in a recovery room without doing surgery first
3330925 our goal is to be able to treat people at the front end of the system
3330926 we always struggle with allowing a person to keep their civil liberties versus an incapacity for consent
3330927 schizophrenia is an extremely large market and one that currently lacks the availability of any real or accurate blood tests
3330928 if you treat them early on in the disease you improve the outcome
3330929 two of the most important things are the small sample size and the cost effectiveness of our service
3330930 with conventional testing and competing technologies it requires so much more blood and fluid to run the test
3330931 everyone was saying decoding the human genome was going to solve all of our problems
3330932 you couldnt look at many proteins at the same time because the technology required too much sampling and it was too expensive
3330933 oftentimes early in the drug development process and up through the phase i human clinical trial they will use the whole panel or a big part of it to look very comprehensively at a particular drug candidate to see if they can tell what are the good and not so good effects of that drug
3330934 have been progressively refined and tested and at times debated in the biomedical and scientific community
3330935 as medicine has moved from being an empirical based science where you are looking at external systems to a more molecular based system this has resulted in a natural explosion of biomarker testing
3330936 its important if there is going to be a problem later on the earlier they can find it in drug development
3330937 they would have spent that extra money taking it all the way through clinical trials
3330938 i could very easily see a time in three to five years where our diagnostic initiatives will be the biggest part of our business
3330939 using our approach and our proprietary technology to help solve some of these complex diseases is a really tremendous tool
3330940 diagnostics will be our biggest growth area in the future
3330941 stop the operation to force the georgian authorities to peace
3330942 the aggressor has been punished and sustained very serious losses
3330943 thats the signal people were waiting for things have fallen so low that we are about 50 percent cheaper than brazilian equity
3330944 they can no longer remain they brought shame upon themselves as peacekeepers they committed crimes
3330945 our troops are making advances we are hoping for success
3330946 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace
3330947 the purpose of the operation has been achieved the security of our peacekeeping forces and the civilian population has been restored
3330948 the operation has achieved its goal security for peacekeepers and civilians has been restored the aggressor was punished suffering huge losses

3330954 los masajes las caricias la risa y cualquier otra sensaci n placentera como los recuerdos de buenos momentos contribuyen a aliviar o curar enfermedades porque colaboran en la segregaci n de endorfinas

3330961 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
3330962 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past
3330963 hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historic facts and personages appear so to speak twice he forgot to add the first time as tragedy the second time as farce
3330964 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
3330965 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
3330966 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
3330967 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
3330968 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
3330969 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
3330970 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
3330971 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
3330972 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
3330973 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
3330974 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

3330981 kelly was the ultimate host and even when the bar bill began to spiral out of control she refused to close the tab she had 30 very thirsty pals so it was always going to be a pretty big night

3330983 people will continue with a bad habit until it hurts
3330984 since we got into popkom festival its opened my ears and eyes to certain opportunities originally i felt we had too many roots in the ground to just get up and tour but wed been planning to tour overseas for 5 years and now i am really excited about going were also going to play some guest spot shows with gotye as his live backing band which is really exciting
3330985 we recorded the album with myles mumford who acted as producer and engineer and he did a great job always suggesting new ideas and taking us to interesting locations we began recording at nmit studios for four days and then we did some choir and string overdubs and then we recorded four days in a row out at the old castlemaine jail and also on a property which was indianas childhood home
3330986 that was the whole intention of recording in different acoustic spaces and in different rooms to see how that affects you emotionally
3330987 the idea of recording in the jail was to harness that history of people there and the madness and just being in that spooky environment they used to hang people and the hanging bar is still there i recorded most of my vocal takes down in solitary confinement and by the end of the vocal take youre a different person and the idea was to try and get that feeling across in the recordings there were some songs where i was almost flipping out because its really cold and dark down there one morning i was actually short of breath because it was so dank and moist and it comes through in the recording
3330988 me and my brother hand made them from big blocks of wood
3330989 we cut it all down and the rest of the band stained them and belinda shire did the art work and put them all together
3330990 they really got peoples attention and opened us up to bits of the industry we never accessed before we decided to do this album really thoroughly and come up with an album that we were happy to listen to years down the track
3330991 weve been fiercely independent im not sure if we were on a label if wed be permitted to make an album like the one we did the freedom it gives you to document your artistic vision means youre not held back but on the other hand you are held back financially but i look forward to not being a band manager and being an artist again so another thing were doing is hunting band managers
3330992 i find it really hard to describe and i actually dont like it when people try and pigeon hole us when youre intimately involved in something its often very difficult to stand apart from it someone once told me if you cant pigeon hole a band it means its just good music the kinda music ive always connected with is that darker side of the psyche i was even obsessed with tori amos for a long time but at the end of the day i think the album has shown people that were a pretty serious band and that were quite unique and quite interesting
3330993 kindness in words creates confidence kindness in thinking creates profundity kindness in giving creates love
3330994 money can never buy you love or happiness you cannot go into a store and pay a person to be your friend i mean you could but i would rather meet them under a big apple tree
3330995 then russian tanks will be able to reach any other european capital
3330996 how the west can stand up to russia snip putin first tried to bring the country to its knees through economic warfare beginning in 2005 he cut off access to russian markets expelled georgians from russia quadrupled the price of russian energy to georgia and severed transport links georgia failed to collapse to the contrary it has flourished snip unable to bend tbilisi to its will the kremlin in recent months ratcheted up the pressure and provocations in south ossetia and abkhazia reinforcing russian forces and russian backed paramilitaries violating georgian air space with russian jets shelling georgian villages and outposts and passing a resolution to treat the two provinces administratively as part of russia snip what can the west do the first step is for the u s and its allies to rush military and medical supplies to tbilisi if we want democracy to survive there georgians have to believe that we have their backs at the moment the tepidness of the western response has given them serious cause for doubt in addition washington should lead the effort to devise a list of economic and diplomatic sanctions toward russia that impose real costs for what moscow has done russia should know that the west has a greater capacity to sustain a new cold war than russia with its petroleum dependent economy does snip the real payback for moscows decision to invade georgia should be the sweet revenge of a strong prosperous and fully independent georgia building on the strides georgia has already made brussels and washington should give tbilisi a clear road to nato and eu membership
3330997 they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights
3330998 august 11 2008 on mondays mark levin show mark returns to the air and goes after russias invasion and attack on georgia russia hates the fact that they are surrounded by pro democratic countries and they have shown their true colors with the recent escalation of violence against georgia they have been trying to destabilize georgia and other countries for over 10 years now this should be seen as a warning to all countries what putin has up his sleeve realizing this how can obama go over to europe and say he would negotiate with hostile countries they are laughing at him and are begging for him to be the next president so they can take advantage of his weaknesses
3330999 they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights

3331003 the truth is that in national security terms hes largely untested and untried
3331004 hes never been responsible for policy formulation hes never had leadership in a crisis or in anything larger than his own element on an aircraft carrier or in managing his own congressional staff its not clear that this is going to be the strong suit that he thinks it is mccains weakness is that hes always been for the use of force force and more force in my experience the only time to use force is as a last resort when he talks about throwing russia out of the g8 and makes ditties about bombing iran he betrays a disrespect for the office of the presidency
3331005 with the signing of risemann we are sticking to our belief that original music like the music made by risemann is something we support and believe in completely and we will keep bringing amazing artists like these to fans in india and the middle east

3331018 in several areas mud and rocks from the mountains have buried entire villages
3331019 the search effort has been difficult because we dont have equipment and the digging has to be done manually

3331021 in confrontations on monday troops killed 26 ltte terrorists and 29 were wounded
3331022 what is clear is that the extremes have been strengthened
3331023 were in the same position as before the referendum but more polarized and with more profound differences
3331024 the national polarization has never been as clearly demarcated as now
3331025 that is the question that will define the immediate future
3331026 it is time to deepen in a democratic way the transformation of the nation
3331027 they flashed up a report saying a ship was missing called the ardgarry

3331034 in fact most of the people touring on the clady circuit will be at the big race at dundrod on saturday
3331035 driving around clady on friday night though is an exercise in pure sentiment
3331036 i pushed out the windscreen with my foot and started taking students out
3331037 next thing i remember i came too and found it hard to breathe i was sore and aching all over
3331038 and please make your position and speak with one united voice
3331039 i like your articles but the independent had a footnote the other day saying that stalin divided north and south ossetia its not true south ossetia has always been georgian
3331040 this things going to crest a half a billion dollars soon
3331041 i wouldnt say watch out mr nicklaus watch out mr woods but he is playing some impressive golf
3331042 i love the idea of the back nine of a major on a sunday i love it so much that im actually disappointed im seven months away from the next major
3331043 i struggle with confidence and that is a change i do need to make
3331044 to be better when my back is against the wall
3331045 most guys who had won two in a row would be on cloud nine and would play great golf for the next six months
3331046 i will be fighting it the next time i play
3331047 it is a long way to catch tiger but i know that the only way of focusing on doing that is focusing on me
3331048 i have to get to grips with where i am in the game
3331049 theres guys who get a little bit fortunate in majors
3331050 they manage to get things going their way unfortunately it hasnt happened to me that doesnt mean im not on the right track its just a matter of time
3331051 shes been here for one week and hasnt seen a doctor even though they know she has been shot
3331052 she is complaining of abdominal pain she understands she lost part of an intestine
3331053 it shows that if you protect these animals then they can recover
3331054 im encouraged by the fact that several of the large whale species that had been in trouble for a long time have shown steady increases over recent decades
3331055 humpbacks have really shown an ability to recover strongly from extremely intensive hunting
3331056 it takes a while for conservationists to build up the confidence that it is a real signal of recovery and not a short term variation
3331057 it is a political question and it will be answered in a political form
3331058 i think it is really important to stress that the red list is not about whether a given species can be exploited
3331059 its simply about looking at the status of these animals and giving people some idea where they are now in relation to where they used to be
3331060 the trouble is that the nets that cause the most trouble the entangling nets that are unselective in what they catch are still being used
3331061 i think we are just seeing the start of the effects of climate change in the oceans another big problem is noise from sonar which we dont fully understand yet
3331062 preventing deliberate harm of that species has been ongoing for nearly a century and has been pretty effective
3331063 but the numbers that are killed in ship strikes and become entangled in lines from lobster and crab traps are preventing the population which is not very big in the first place recovering
3331064 how you stop or reduce that is a real challenge
3331065 the data deficient category is pretty large for cetaceans probably surprisingly large to many people
3331066 it is the species that live far offshore that are found in less developed parts of the world that in many cases we dont have a clue about how many there are
3331067 given that the nc is adamant to allowing us to have the defence ministry in a government led by us we talked with the cpn uml about ways to find solutions to this state of deadlock and we even urged the cpn uml to lead the government if they wish to
3331068 both the cpn m and nc have urged us to lead the next government but we are stressing forming a national consensus government incorporating at least four major parties
3331069 i came to the conclusion that the world is a big place and there is more to life than watching the daily commuter traffic and allowing passing cats to urinate on you there have been high points low points and positively terrifying points but i have survived
3331070 i just keep thinking how funny it is it makes me smile to see all the people he met on his travels it was a wonderful surprise and of course its so nice to get some good news the story really is unbelievable it was a beautifully written letter the intriguing thing is that someone had gone to such trouble to do this for a complete stranger
3331071 im really happy about that as if i had to name them as of now i wouldnt know what do
3331072 parental support is the most important contribution to childrens education
3331073 we must get parents involved in their childrens schooling as early as possible in primary schools and where parents have had less than satisfactory support in school themselves our system must be geared to giving them help and support
3331074 it is important that we bring parents along with us particularly those that have a negative attitude to schools or their own abilities
3331075 we have to help them if we want to help their children
3331076 there are some areas of northern ireland where specialised and focused support is needed
3331077 im pleased to see some of you with very solid focus here today
3331078 i know this subject can be hard and some of you are clearly frustrated but are keeping at it anyway and so special kudos to you
3331079 for those of you who have never done this before thank you for giving me and this subject your time and attention and willingness
3331080 wir wollen erst einmal den ersten bundesliga spieltag abwarten und dann n chste woche entscheiden wer spielt
3331081 wir gehen das sehr gelassen an und wollen den konkurrenzkampf f rdern wir haben nicht den druck eine entscheidung in der n chsten woche f llen zu m ssen
3331082 die berufung freut mich nat rlich enorm aber ich will nicht zu euphorisch sein ich war ja schon ein paar mal nominiert aber es war wie verhext immer kam eine verletzung dazwischen aber dieses mal wird es hoffentlich hinhauen
3331083 das ist genau der richtige zeitpunkt um ihn zu sehen
3331084 toni kroos wird zun chst bei der u21 sein er hat sehr gro e qualit t mal sehen wie er sich in der bundesliga pr sentiert dann werden wir ihn sicher auch nominieren
3331085 unser ziel ist es dass wir uns wieder schnell und direkt qualifizieren und dass wir die spielweise mit blick auf 2010 verbessern
3331086 kein selbstl ufer da wir mit russland in einer gruppe sind
3331087 nicht einfach einen kader zu benennen man wei nicht wo die spieler stehen die em teilnehmer sind sp ter ins training eingestiegen zudem sind einige spieler angeschlagen
3331088 derjenige der die 2000 dauerkarte erwirbt bekommt sie von der hsg geschenkt
3331089 were going to continue our peaceful struggle for the return of the president
3331090 yes i am in a bad mood no it is nothing to do with you yes i will get over it understand good lets go on with the lesson
3331091 probably the biggest lie told in schools though is that the way to succeed is through following the rules
3331092 i treat this matter delicately because this person needs privacy
3331093 we are extremely concerned to hear about goods shrinking in size without shrinking in price as it cheats unsuspecting shoppers already under financial pressure from rising household and motoring costs in america it is known as the grocery shrink ray and this is one trend from the us that we definitely dont want too much of over here
3331094 we seek to keep our confectionery affordable in order to offer our consumers value for money and therefore we have slightly reduced the size on some of the larger sharing packs rather than directly raising prices
3331095 the decision to introduce a new 15 can pack of strongbow was brought about by our need to raise wholesale prices in face of the widespread and unprecedented rise in business costs and retailers desire to continue to offer strongbow in a similar party pack format at the same price point had retailers not chosen to go down this route they would have had to pass on a hefty price increase to purchasers of the old 18 can pack and they clearly feel no price increase on a smaller pack offers better consumer value
3331096 we have reduced our mince pack size slightly however we have absorbed a significant amount of the farm gate price increase
3331097 even in a credit crunch most customers are savvy enough to see these tactics as underhand companies should realise that once caught out their corporate reputation could suffer and customers always have the power to switch brands
3331098 frivolous shopping is off the agenda as most customers concentrate on value and durability and there are few signs the slowdown has yet bottomed out
3331099 without exception all the retailers i am talking to are not optimistic at all
3331100 youll never achieve perfection but youve got to keep trying to get it
3331101 we have been employing a full time psychologist in the agency since 1994 all the ads we do are very heavily psychologically researched the shock strategy that we adopted in road safety was made in 1994 and screened in 1995 and they had a dramatic impact from then on they are based on a very clear psychological strategy that is tested before they go on air and then it is tracked and measured afterwards
3331102 the number of road deaths overall is falling a fall of 25
3331103 2007 was the lowest year on record for road deaths since 1947
3331104 excessive speed is the number one killer driver alcohol and drugs is number two and number three will be careless inattention factors we analyse the data over five and 10 year periods the proportions stay the same but the overall number of deaths and serious injuries are falling
3331105 the 12 year saving since we have introduced shock ads has resulted in 5 396 people less being killed or seriously injured on our roads thats 5 396 people alive in northern ireland today who would otherwise be dead
3331106 these adverts arent working well enough any more i think initially they had an impact
3331107 i want to beat anyone i tee it up against and it doesnt matter whether its at match play or stroke play
3331108 yet it would be an honour to beat padraig harrington you know just like beating sergio garcia who has been a giant killer himself at the ryder cup
3331109 im ready to go out and play either one of them now it dont matter who paul puts me against
3331110 pretty incredible especially coming after winning the open just three weeks ago
3331111 to shoot eight under par over the weekend on this golf course is almost unimaginable
3331112 winning in the us adds a different dimension to his cv
3331113 this will open up new opportunities in the states to win a major elevates any players status but to capture two opens and then a pga further enhances that
3331114 i dont need to improve any more to win majors
3331115 when i was on the 17th tee i felt like i was going to win the pga championship
3331116 i think i fail a lot less than everyone else
3331117 he knows how to win hes not afraid to win and thats what it takes
3331118 i need the laptop back as soon as possible not only was there a copy of my doctoral thesis on it but there was also more recent research work and book proposal documents
3331119 i need that laptop back im having problems functioning professionally without it and people should note that it does look distinctive as theres not many of them around
3331120 as a club weve never won the european cup two years on the trot so we must step up to the plate if we want to achieve that
3331121 croatia played good enough they played with spirit pride in their country patriotism theyre a good team playing on the counter attack very well theyve got good quality in midfield and in their forwards but i think we are ready to win against croatia
3331122 i think we have a very good team its not important who the opponents are whats important is us its very important to me for qualification for the world cup i will be in south africa im sure of it why not
3331123 the level of the players is good but we are at the same level or better we have to play with this spirit
3331124 i have to transmit this spirit we have to play with a lot of confidence im sure we will do so
3331125 its better for their wives usually when theyre married they find a balance
3331126 i know a lot of players who smoke it is part of life
3331127 when i was a player a lot of my friends and team mates smoked it depends if he smokes five cigarettes or 20 cigarettes
3331128 the best team won the euros because spain played with confidence
3331129 after the game against italy they played with a lot of confidence there were other teams and countries who played with a lot of spirit technically we are very good like the spanish players but we have a different mentality and i think the movement of the team on the pitch has to be very compact
3331130 i have assured singapore investors and other investors that we know what they want and that politically things are in order its very stable and whatever investments they have put in we assure that they will be secured policy wise theres no change its business as usual
3331131 we are all very pragmatic politicians and malaysians as well will not easily fall prey into this sort of ambitious plan you are talking about a massive exodus that will have to happen to create where he will be in a majority situation and based on the statements and commitments made by the leaders of the component parties i dont see how that can happen
3331132 vrouwen worden niet geacht actief een partner te zoeken een vrouw dient slechts te wachten tot een man haar wil trouwen of van haar wil scheiden
3331133 als je met iemand gaat picknicken moet je hem wel wat langer kennen dan dat laat staan als je gaat trouwen
3331134 het ergste voorbeeld van een ongetrouwde vrouw zij representeert alleen zichzelf en andere zieke mensen waar zijn haar fatsoen en puurheid
3331135 ik vind dat mevrouw ghada niet op deze manier over huwelijkskandidaten moet praten ik ben zelf om haar hand komen vragen ze moet het feit dat ze op haar leeftijd nog altijd vrijgezel is niet afschuiven op de mannen
3331136 als er een man aan de deur was gekomen die met het internet overweg kon was ik al lang met hem getrouwd
3331137 we think it will not affect the sailing events as an oil film is usually emulsified in a few days and the north wind will blow it southward and away from the competition area

3331192 no one tears a piece from a new coat and puts it on an old one
3331193 why do you say yes sir yes sir but dont do what i say i will show you what a person who comes to me relationship is like a person who hears my words faith comes by hearing and puts them into practice obedience that person is like a house builder who dug down deep and set the foundations on rock when a flood came the torrents of water dashed against that house but didnt have the strength to shake it because it was well built but the person who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a person who built a house on the ground without any foundation the torrents of water dashed against it and immediately it collapsed in a heap this house broke up in a catastrophic way
3331194 i can certainly say that i havent come across such great faith even in israel
3331195 you are the one that i want to see you said youd manifest yourself to me if i will just obey the words that you speak then you will dwell with me

3331197 if you follow my decrees and are careful to obey my commands
3331198 i will put my dwelling place among you and i will not abhor you i will walk among you and be your god and you will be my people
3331199 i will live with them and walk among them and i will be their god and they will be my people

3331220 i have never supported the brutal expulsion of all palestinians i have said repeatedly that the expulsion of the palestinians is immoral and impracticable
3331221 under some circumstances expulsion is not a war crime i dont think that the expulsions of 1948 of nearly a million palestinians were war crimes you cant make an omelet without breaking eggs you have to dirty your hands moreover if he israeli prime minister ben gurion was already engaged in expulsion maybe he should have done a complete job i know that this stuns the arabs and the liberals and the politically correct types but my feeling is that this place would be quieter and know less suffering if the matter had been resolved once and for all if ben gurion had carried out a large expulsion and cleaned the whole country the whole land of israel as far as the jordan river it may yet turn out that this was his fatal mistake if he carried out a full expulsion rather than a partial one he would have stabilized the state of israel for generations

3331225 barbarians who want to take our lives at the moment that society is in the state of being a serial killer it is a very sick society it should be treated the way we treat individuals who are serial killers
3331226 every intelligence agency in the world believes the iranian program is geared to making weapons not to the peaceful application of nuclear power
3331227 everyone knows that such measures economic sanctions have so far led nowhere and are unlikely to be applied
3331228 never advocated a genocidal attack on iran with the aim of killing 70 million iranians
3331229 irans leaders would do well to re think their gamble and suspend their nuclear program barring this the best they could hope for is that israels conventional air assault will destroy their nuclear facilities to be sure this would mean thousands of iranian casualties and international humiliation but the alternative is an iran turned into a nuclear wasteland
3331230 israeli nuclear threat morris has pre determined the result israel will have to engage in a genocidal nuclear assault on iran
3331231 i was thrown on the ground and noticed only the stalks of my flowers were left everything was still and quiet and when i got up there were people naked not saying anything some of them had no skin or hair i was certain i was dead
3331232 air supremacy over japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
3331233 no effort was made and none was seriously considered to achieve surrender merely in order not to have to use the bomb
3331234 to browbeat the russians with the bomb held rather ostentatiously on our hip
3331235 there was never any illusion on my part that russia was our enemy and that the project was conducted on that basis

3331249 we have nuit space hadit the point of view these experience congress and so produce heru ra ha who combines the ideas of ra hoor khuit and hoor paar kraat
3331250 my scribe ankh af na khonsu the priest of the princes shall not in one letter change this book but lest there be folly he shall comment thereupon by the wisdom of ra hoor khuit
3331251 i had stupidly supposed this comment to be a scholarly exposition of the book an elucidation of its obscurities and a demonstration of its praeterhuman origin i understand at last that this idea is nonsense the comment must be an interpretation of the book intelligible to the simplest minds and as practical as the ten commandments
3331252 the alternative is an iran turned into a nuclear wasteland
3331253 those who brought the samson complex here according to which we shall kill and bury all the gentiles around us while we ourselves shall die with them
3331254 purpose of israeli nuclear weapons not often stated but obvious is their use on the united states
3331255 it is dangerous in the extreme that in the cauldron of animosities that we call the middle east one nation has armed itself ostensibly with stockpiles of nuclear weapons perhaps numbering in the hundreds and that inspires other nations to do so
3331256 could have an impact on us for the next 100 years
3331257 irans achievement is creating an image of itself as a scary superpower when its really a paper tiger
3331258 to work toward a political and diplomatic settlement under which iran will maintain the right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes
3331259 every intelligence agency in the world believes the iranian programme is geared toward making weapons
3331260 with high confidence that in fall 2003 teheran halted its nuclear weapons programme
3331261 we are going to nationalize banco de venezuela i make an appeal to grupo santander to come here so that we can start to negotiate
3331262 months ago i received the information through intelligence sources that banco de venezuela which had been privatized for years was being sold by its spanish owners that an agreement had been signed between grupo santander and a venezuelan private banker then the venezuelan banker needed the permission of the government to buy a bank this is not a small operation and then i sent a message to the spanish and the venezuelan banker to tell them that the government wanted to buy the bank we want to recover it then the owners said no we dont want to sell it so now i say no i will buy it how much is it we are going to pay for it and we are going to nationalize banco de venezuela
3331263 from this moment the media campaign on the part of the spanish and international media is going to start they are going to say that ch vez is an autocrat that ch vez is a tyrant i dont care we are going to nationalize the bank regardless
3331264 there is something obscure here because its owners first were desperate to sell and now they are saying they do not want to sell it to the venezuelan state we are going to nationalize it so that it is put at the service of the venezuelan people
3331265 we need a bank of that size because this is the banco de venezuela but this bank generates massive profits but these profits are going abroad
3331266 profits will not go to one private group they will be invested in socialist social development socialism is stronger every day that passes
3331267 its looking like a negative development i dont see why the banking sector needs to be under the purview of the public sector
3331268 the private sector does a much more efficient job of running that type of business
3331269 socialism for the rich and free enterprise for the poor
3331270 the world is full of negative influences but what make you different is how motivated you are among the herd
3331271 all moors can cope with some harriers but few gamekeepers allow any of these predators to breed because of the fear that numbers will subsequently flourish a ceiling scheme is a way of encouraging grouse managers to put an end to illegal killing of harriers safe in the knowledge that numbers will not reach densities where they can threaten the viability of their grouse moors
3331272 if successful this could prove to be a way to both minimise the local impact of predation on grouse moors and increase the national population of harriers providing a win win situation for harrier conservation and grouse management
3331273 hunters have been slow to recognise that illegal killing of raptors is unacceptable in 21st century society where there is strong support for conservation conservationists on the other hand have been unwilling to compromise over any form of intervention to limit harrier densities citing european legislation which prevents such action
3331274 we feel that a fundamental change in attitude is required from all parties to resolve the conflict between harriers and grouse if those involved genuinely wish to strive for a solution then compromises will be required and attitudes to predators their control and their protection will have to be modified to accommodate changed circumstances
3331275 our earlier work showed that feeding harriers can greatly reduce predation rates on grouse chicks however we still do not know how feeding will affect harrier numbers in the long term and indeed whether fed harriers and grouse shooting can coexist
3331276 some of these issues will be addressed by ongoing work at langholm however we suggest that the quickest way of finding an effective solution to this problem is to simultaneously make progress on different fronts it is sensible to test a harrier ceiling now and not wait for ten years until the langholm moor demonstration project is complete

3331296 there is no need for calling a strike because the government has already paid new salaries in july and is working towards establishing the correct amount of arrears it owes its workers
3331297 we are surprised and do not understand the basis on which they are organising the protest the government is not late and we aim to pay all arrears between august and september
3331298 parliament approved the money for the workers but they are yet to be paid the reasons for that are best known by the government on our side we formally announce a strike

3331309 to begin with let us take the following motto literature is love now we can continue
3331310 i can be changed by what happens to me but i refuse to be reduced by it

3331322 een onaangekondigde staking zoals deze berokkent ons veel directe en indirecte schade het is de opdracht van de regering tussenbeide te komen en met de hulp van een regeringsbemiddelaar zo vlug mogelijk een sociaal akkoord af te dwingen
3331323 reizigers lopen hun vlucht mis zien hun vakantiedagen slinken en worden op extra kosten gejaagd deze onaangekondigde staking kost diverse instellingen en ondernemingen miljoenen euros schade en schaadt het imago van onze nationale luchthaven wie een maatschappelijke functie heeft en in de nationale luchthaven dienstverlening voor de burgers voorziet mag zijn eisen niet binnenhalen door reizigers te gijzelen wat voor de nmbs geldt geldt net zo goed voor de partners van onze nationale luchthaven

3331334 liang zhang daagde niet tijdig op voor de start van de skiff zhang plaatste zich als skiffeur en in de dubbeltwee voor de spelen
3331335 de chinese roeifederatie wist dat indien zij beide startplaatsen op de spelen behield zhang ook verplicht was om in beide olympische voorwedstrijden effectief te starten toen liang zhang zich niet meldde aan de start van de voorwedstrijd in de skiff kon ik niet anders dan de chinese dubbeltwee de start weigeren
3331336 eerst toverden ze allerlei argumenten uit de hoed om uit te leggen waarom hun skiffeur niet aan de start verscheen daarna tekenden ze aangetekend beroep aan bij de internationale federatie die bevestigde eenparig mijn beslissing

3331342 zelfs indien de staking vandaag afloopt zal het nog enkele dagen duren vooraleer de koffers opnieuw bij hun eigenaars zullen zijn
3331343 de mensen moeten zich geen zorgen maken hoewel het lang zal duren want het is een gigantische hoeveelheid die gesorteerd en gecontroleerd moet worden
3331344 het is in principe altijd mogelijk om bagage van de band te halen die van iemand anders is maar er staan zichtbare en onzichtbare cameras en er is meer veiligheidspersoneel dan normaal

3331349 when we set up monumental three years ago i didnt want to be a game developer i didnt think it was a very good business model for all the fundamental reasons having to rely on publishers to give you money 18 to 24 month development cycles
3331350 mmos you get one deal and its there for 10 or 20 years who knows and thats really a good way to think about business
3331351 the problem is obviously making a successful one in the first place

3331353 the regulatory burden on business has increased considerably in recent years the governments proposal to introduce regulatory budgets for government departments is an innovative approach to controlling the problem of costly regulation john hutton the secretary of state for business enterprise and regulatory reform is to be congratulated for advancing this idea
3331354 as usual the devil will be in the detail for regulatory budgets to work the regulatory impact assessments for new regulations must be robust indirect as well as direct costs should be included the games development sector would naturally like to see the costs of new employment regulations included in regulatory budgets
3331355 ultimately halting and cutting the burden of regulation is a matter of political will not budgetary process the experience of the governments golden rule illustrates that apparently hard budget rules can be bent if regulatory budgets are to be effective ministers must take full responsibility for any breaches in costs that occur individual departments and their ministers should be held to full account not just by the better regulation executive and parliament but also by the prime minister above all ministers must be committed to lightening the regulatory burden on business
3331356 gamesindustry biz is one of my starting tabs when i boot up so its always one of the first sites i see each day its good being able to catch up with whats happened in the us overnight and in the uk before im awake first thing and know that the stories will be accurate and thought out

3331417 i recognise the importance of rural supports role in providing assistance to farmers and farm families suffering stress associated with farming
3331418 they understand the issues that affect the farming and rural community most and work with the farmer and the farm family to help them deal with stress
3331419 these combined with difficulties caused by regulations and legislation and changing social environments including family breakdowns and isolation among older people can all contribute to increased levels of stress
3331420 i would urge farmers and farm families who are anxious or feeling stressed to contact rural support as soon as possible so that support can be put in place to help alleviate worries and anxieties
3331421 this funding will allow rural support to continue developing our outreach work and support farmers and rural families who are feeling worried or stressed
3331422 it secures our position for the next year and we look forward to strengthening our relationship with dard and other key statutory community and voluntary organisations with a role in rural areas in helping to build a strong base for our ongoing work

3331554 there are only so many georgia songs we can reference in our headlines said foreign affairs analyst judith barnett
3331555 georgia on my mind obviously and midnight train to georgia you can even use variations on rainy night in georgia but the longer the crisis went on the more likely it was that people would intervene inappropriately one colleague of mine at the daily record was toying with im gonna be 500 miles from tblisi which just about works but we heard reports that the united states was considering invoking its nuclear umbrella ella ella which would have been catastrophic

3331588 the positive sentiment seen at the end of first quarter 2008 that the credit crisis may be easing was short lived as trading conditions deteriorated significantly in the second half of may in particular for assets related to u s residential real estate as well as other structured credit positions
3331589 this occurred in the context of continuing credit market turbulence and its impact on the firms operating performance and reputation
3331590 the uncertain near term outlook for global financial markets and potential changes in regulatory capital requirements
3331591 our review has clearly revealed the weaknesses associated with the integrated one firm business model
3331592 some of these weaknesses such as the blurring of the true risk reward profile of individual businesses are the source of substantial risk as we have seen in the past few months

3331604 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
3331605 unfortunately from a republican perspective there are two different jurisdictions and two different economies and two different realities on the island
3331606 the major question historians will ask is not why the republicans surrendered but why they fought such a futile long war
3331607 it has not been unconditional surrender and it has been infinitely better than continuing to fight a futile war for the sake of honouring irelands dead yet producing only more of them but let us not labour under any illusions that the conditions were good
3331608 party leader david ford claimed today that the dup and sinn fein do not want the minister to be a member of the executive meaning he or she would have no role in wider issues like the budget
3331609 so called breakthrough over the department of justice amounts to very little
3331610 apparently all the dup and sinn fein have proposed is a minister who would not even be a member of the executive
3331611 how could anyone fulfil a role as important as justice minister in those circumstances
3331612 should be a runaway winner an eye for detail humour and history i want to be him
3331613 depth variety and regular posts and a bit of politics too
3331614 a brilliant mix of humour politics and insightful analysis not just of ni but of british left politics and beyond where else do you get postings in what i assume is serbo croat beside gail walker watch and the photos attaching to the stories are usually hilarious although a disappointing absence of girls aloud as naughty schoolgirls of late
3331615 for its unusual socialist outlook on northern ireland and wider politics his is the perspective of someone who feels not unreasonably that the present party political system leaves his left wing views unrepresented as such he stands aside from the traditional ni partisan discussions a refreshing interesting and nicely written blog
3331616 is written with a certain amount of linquistic flair this is a blogger who clearly enjoys his english he also enjoys reading and gives us book reviews and cultural pieces his political position is self described as liberal unionist but his views are not entirely predictable and the items rather eclectic including a fascination with and dislike for ethnic nationalism in its east european manifestations
3331617 chekov really has a penchant for writing in a way that really grasps the reader
3331618 i hate to say it but chekov does write well
3331619 passionate unionism epitomising the pan uk unionist approach oneill synthesises an incredible amount of material for this blog a blogger with a genuine grasp of his subject
3331620 for the fact that he is in public office and combines council business and interesting outlooks generally
3331621 but only since pol omuiri came on board since then it has moved beyond a party political platform to something more considered and interesting
3331622 a group blog fairly closely associated with an identifiable political party is quite a good thing as it provides a picture of that partys id as well as a space for them to develop their thinking about issues that they will sometimes have to answer for their stance on soonish
3331623 a wee part of the blogosphere where i can be found and i shamelessly do so because it will permit me to state that the blog in question has been nominated four times in political blog categories and lost four times
3331624 i agree with its tone and attitude regarding the north of ireland situation
3331625 ignited has a grasp of the nuts and bolts of politics which i envy reading his pieces always make me view my own stuff as a bit conceptual and airy fairy a blog which is in touch with the unionist grass roots
3331626 fair deal is one of the very few bloggers delivering a dup standpoint in a thoughtful manner i rarely agree with what he says but hes always worth reading damian oloan is an excellent new addition writing coherent and temperate analysis from a liberal nationalist perspective an encouraging indication that moderation is not dead
3331627 fair deal damian oloan tom griffin patrick corrigan and very occasionally ian parsley all are delivering thoughtful and coherent articles analysing different areas of political life here
3331628 almost intimidating erudition from brian crowe as he examines the world from communitarian conservative perspective
3331629 where language literature and politics intersect some thoughtful musings on identity in relation to northern ireland from an irish ex pat
3331630 a tyrone ex pats whimsical blog where politics is viewed through the filters of sport travel identity and more recently fiction
3331631 a new collaborative venture by a number of bloggers braodly on the left it deals in political social and cultural issues as well as some humour
3331632 possibly the most impressive blog there are serious and thoughtful pieces virtually every day on a huge range of topics
3331633 serving up an interesting mix of investigative journalism and local interest
3331634 david vance really out posts the other contributors and hes from the north though id say that his focus is a good deal wider but his stuff on ni is quite astute

3331681 an early draft of the regulation found its way into public circulation before it had reached my review
3331682 it contained words that lead some to conclude my intent is to deal with the subject of contraceptives somehow defining them as abortion not true
3331683 the bush administration has consistently supported the unborn however the issue i asked to be addressed in this regulation is not abortion or contraceptives but the legal right medical practitioners have to practice according to their conscience and patients should be able to choose a doctor who has beliefs like his or hers
3331684 any activity with a logical connection to a procedure health service or health service program or research activity this includes referral training and other arrangements of the procedure health service or research activity
3331685 any of the various procedures including the prescription dispensing and administration of any drug or the performance of any procedure or any other action that results in the termination of life of a human being in utero between conception and natural birth whether before or after implantation
3331686 until the regulation removes the re definition of abortion and it clearly states that it deals solely with abortion and not with any other procedure nor with any refusals based on the nature of the patient such as single or gay i would not be satisfied
3331687 there is no reason to extend any benefit of the doubt to this administration when it comes to reproductive rights or the civil rights of gay people
3331688 still contemplating if it will issue a regulation or not if it does it will be directly focused on the protection of practitioner practice

3331699 la giunta sembra vergognarsi delle proprie azioni questo quanto emerge dallatteggiamento di ieri pomeriggio
3331700 in una sola seduta di giunta a met agosto sotto 38 gradi con firenze invasa da turisti e svuotata da gran parte dei fiorentini sono state approvate delibere come il piano strutturale nuove ulteriori varianti in corso dopera alle tre linee tranviarie e una strada tra la leopolda e via pistoiese che tanti dubbi e critiche ha ricevuto negli anni passati
3331701 e poco serio nei confronti della cittadinanza predisporre il passaggio in giunta del piano strutturale l11 agosto con un blitz da parte dellassessore biagi che ha tutto il sapore di una forzatura dei tempi afferma grassi dei verdi decidere come sar firenze nel 2020 di nascosto dagli occhi dei fiorentini durante un periodo di ferie per molti non una scelta condivisibile
3331702 gi nel 2006 ladozione del piano strutturale fu approvata dal consiglio comunale nel mese di luglio senza che tanti cittadini neppure lo sapessero ricorda lesponente dei verdi in quella occasione mi ero espresso criticando il piano non votando al quartiere il parere favorevole predisposto dalla maggioranza sia per le modalit frettolose con cui era stata affrontata la discussione sia per i contenuti che ritengo ancora oggi frutto di una teoria urbanistica senza controllo e di una politica affarista che svende anche le ormai sempre meno libere zone della citt ai soliti privati incrinando irrimediabilmente lequilibrio gi adesso precario tra densificazione urbana spazi vuoti e per la collettivit
3331703 quanto successo ieri non sicuramente n un bel segnale che viene dato ai fiorentini n tanto meno il segnale che i verdi si aspettavano dal partito di maggioranza relativa in attesa di stringere le alleanze in vista del 2009 dichiara grassi tommaso alcuni esponenti del pd gi convinti di correre da soli nel 2009 vorrebbero che il piano strutturale fosse approvato dallattuale maggioranza per poi affrontare una campagna elettorale in cui non solo il pd sia colpevole agli occhi dei cittadini di aver dato il via libera ad un piano che consegner la citt in mano ai soliti noti costruttori edili e far trionfare la politica affarista di una certa parte del pd
3331704 anche se come anche alcuni membri della giunta che ieri hanno approvato la delibera a scatola chiusa ancora non abbiamo ricevuto la versione definitiva del piano strutturale al pi presto cominceremo a valutare i contenuti del piano e non ci sottrarremo di criticare proporre e sottolineare ci che non ci soddisfa

3331855 while rising food costs do present a challenge we must continue to invest in our schools our childrens health is at stake
3331856 schools are doing amazing things even with limited resources but if we want to help them move to the next level we need to provide the corresponding commitment and financial support
3331857 if we continue to build on the energy that schools are generating we can make significant improvements to our childrens health everyone has a role to play in reversing the childhood obesity epidemic we cant expect schools to shoulder the burden and work on sheer creativity and enthusiasm alone

3331891 the owner of the land in question alerted me to the article and it is something we had not even considered initially
3331892 it could prove to be important in the application process so we are eager to speak to the team of researchers to see what can be done and if we can help in any way with the research
3331893 we are more than willing to open dialogue with the researchers in the hope of understanding the issue better
3331894 it doesnt necessarily mean the development wont go ahead but it does mean that we would look to find compromises
3331895 part of the application involves the acknowledgement of micro sites meaning that actual placement of turbines isnt set in stone
3331896 each turbine has a 75 metre area around it which it could be moved to if needs be meaning we could work together to place the turbines away from any sites of historical importance
3331897 we have no reservation about presenting the case to simon peltenburg or anyone else our case is resilient however we know that his paymasters are the developers and as such he has one agenda only and that is to publicly appear compromising but in fact their noses are to the ground following this gravy train
3331898 we will speak to him with pleasure but outside of curb i can assure mr peltenberg that we will fight any development that is a desecration of our cultural and spiritual history and heritage which is in the main welsh or celtic
3331899 we have carried out dry runs with empty lorries to see how the road network would cope with the traffic and there were no issues arose which hadnt previously been discussed for the application

3331909 although wind is an intermittent power source as output depends on wind strength it can supplement vermonts larger baseload 24 7 power sources vermont yankee and hydroqu bec
3331910 while wind power is a popular and growing source of electricity generation in the united states it continues to face regulatory obstacles and local opposition
3331911 and while there is clear potential for an expansion of wind in the state of vermont even fully developed wind can only meet a fraction of the states electricity needs to ensure that vermont has a dependable supply of clean and low cost electricity base load providers such as vermont yankee and hydroqu bec must continue to serve our state into the future
3331912 vermont energy partnership is a questionable organization with facts that dont check out
3331913 all this is a lightly veiled attempt to downplay renewable energy solutions and support vermont yankee
3331914 the u s wind energy industry installed 5 244 megawatts expanding the nations total wind power generating capacity by 45 percent in a single calendar year and injecting an investment of over 9 billion into the economy
3331915 thats a lot of money but its a one time cost
3331916 and compared to the 700 billion we spend on foreign oil every year its a bargain

3332068 qatar cat coalition qcc friends of the environment world society for the protection of animals wspa and a volunteer legal company are currently working with the government to implement various animal laws in qatar
3332069 these laws are extensive and vary from the import and export of animals to pet shops and the day to day care of animals
3332070 one needs to understand the ramifications of the law and how it would be implemented and enforced
3332071 how then does one enforce the law should the sponsor of the expatriate be involved if this were the case many sponsors would not allow expatriates to own animals
3332072 only registered parties should be permitted to breed animals and all breeders would have to meet certain standards and would never be allowed to place a sick animal with a new owner
3332073 a new owner would be educated on the ownership responsibility such as ensuring the animal has regular veterinary check ups and when the animal reaches maturity it should be sterilised unless the owner is a registered breeder

3332106 there are between 20 and 50 jet skis here every day
3332107 when we open the gate for boats many try to rush inside however if any do get in i call the coastguard who comes to take them out again
3332108 every single manual for jet skis explains they should never be operated at night however people race them around the lagoon in the dark which is seriously dangerous
3332109 they also affect people swimming during the day and annoy boats by trying to splash them
3332110 they often chase waterskiers or wakeboarders which is also really dangerous
3332111 i think there should be increased coastguard presence and some sort of screening process before people can own or rent a jet ski

3332145 when i was making the film i never thought it would be such an acclaimed movie every filmmaker has some dreams and this film has given me more than i dreamt of it surpassed my expectations it has also given a lot to the entire cast and crew and its success is beyond their imagination too
3332146 after making this film i moved to television and worked there for seven years i returned with kabhi haan kabhi naa i have written a story about a prostitute and it is also a political satire the story is about a prostitute on the run who enters the vortex of by elections and ends up becoming a chief minister
3332147 when i decided to make jaane bhi i applied for a loan of rs 400 000 but later the nfdc decided to fund it the initial budget of the movie was rs 685 000 but the production cost went up and finally it was made at a budget of rs 725 000

3332186 theres so much interest as to guys who plays girls or girls who play guys sometimes its assumed that people play their own gender but a lot of the times people dont its obviously a really important choice that we want people to be able to make on their own

3332188 the leprechaun went missing many many months ago and i had forgotten about it
3332189 then i opened the door on thursday and saw he was back it was such a shock
3332190 i thought well its a bit of mischief but at least he hasnt been put through the window
3332191 then i saw it was a beautifully bound photo album and opened it up
3332192 his feet were missing but thats no real surprise given that he was sent abseiling down a mountain

3332205 the youth of assam is very much discouraged with the authoritarian approach towards the logistic end of the influx problem of the region though the government is taking them as a vote bank but we are the most terrible victims of this as the bangladeshis are coming in huge numbers and taking advantages of the small sectors like labours agriculture and industries
3332206 the assamese people are themselves responsible for this dependant situation on the bangladeshi labours no industry work or rather organisation is ready to take the blame but to shout on illogical ends of the problem rather good and eligible bangladeshis should be treated as a man power and should provide the job cards for their employments legally but we strongly oppose the influx illogically for some shallow gains
3332207 we just want to show that assamese youth can also pull the rickshaw and earn their lives and can do it with dignity then rather depend on some bangladeshis to do it for us if we respect our culture and know our responsibility then no outsiders can take over us it s the only motto of todays rally

3332431 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3332432 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3332433 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3332434 while it is an entirely new dictionary in this series
3332435 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3332436 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3332437 people will instantly see the new game as easy and fun and instantly appreciate the novel use of recycled and reused materials

3332439 by choosing to travel by rail amtrak passengers are already a step ahead because the carbon footprint generated by their trip is smaller than that of most other modes of transportation
3332440 because it is more energy efficient traveling by rail contributes less per passenger mile to greenhouse gas emissions than either cars or airplanes rail travel also helps to reduce highway congestion in major urban centers
3332441 norfolk trains may be painted black and white but every day they prove theyre green

3332448 with the latest in system technologies and aerodynamics the cseries family of aircraft will revolutionize the economics and network strategies for airline operations in the 100 to 149 seat commercial market
3332449 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3332450 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3332451 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3332454 if the anti democratic individual is disposed to see in the outer world impulses which are suppressed in himself
3332455 and we to know what these impulses are then something may be learned by noting what attributes he most readily but unrealistically ascribes to the world around him it seemed that the greater a subjects preoccupation with evil forces in the world as shown by his readiness to think about and to believe in the existence of such phenomena as wild erotic excesses plots and conspiracies and danger from natural catastrophes the stronger would be his own unconscious urges of both sexuality and destructiveness
3332456 homosexuality is a particularly rotten form of delinquency and ought to be severely punished
3332457 no matter how they act on the surface men are interested in women for only one reason
3332458 the sexual orgies of the old greeks and romans are nursery school stuff compared to some of the goings on in this country today even in circles where people might least expect it
3332459 sex crimes such as rape and attacks on children deserve more than mere imprisonment such criminals ought to be publicly whipped
3332460 a strong inclination to punish violators of sex mores homosexuals sex offenders may be an expression of a general punitive attitude based on identification within group authorities
3332461 but it also suggests that the subjects own sexual desires are suppressed and in danger of getting out of hand
3332462 moralistic and punitive attitude toward the supposed sexuality of others
3332463 the authors investigated the role of homsexual arousal in exclusively heterosexual men who admitted negative affect toward homosexual individuals participants consisted of a group of homophobic men n 35 they were assigned to groups on the basis of their scores on the index of homophobia w w hudson and w a ricketts 1980 the men were exposed to sexually explicit erotic stimuli consisting of heterosexual male homosexual and lesbian videotapes only the homophobic men showed an increase in penile erection to male homosexual stimuli homophobia is apparently associated with homosexual arousal that the homophobic individual is either unaware of or denies
3332464 violence anarchic impulses and chaotic destructiveness in the unconscious sphere the pseudo conservative is a man who in the name of upholding traditional american values and institutions and defending them against more or less fictitious dangers consciously or unconsciously aims at their abolition

3332468 are being asked to take twenty per cent less for their barley
3332469 the justification used by diageo for increasing the price of a pint is due to higher raw material costs yet their main supplier greencore malt is cutting the price paid to malting barley growers by over 20 per cent
3332470 twelve months ago growers saw the first substantial recovery in grain prices after three decades of falling prices however the honeymoon has been short lived as two of the major expenditure items energy and fertiliser costs increased by over 66 per cent in the last year and grain prices have fallen
3332471 we suggest malting barley growers continue dialogue with the malting companies at the appropriate forum for pricing issues and cease making ill considered allegations against parties who are not involved in the pricing discussions
3332472 christian and muslim lives are being lost thousands of families are displaced soldiers are being killed and wounded
3332473 is this the price that mindanao has to pay just to advance ms arroyos selfish agenda
3332474 the real motive for the grp government of the republic of the philippines milf moa on ancestral domain has been finally admitted by president arroyo
3332475 while the opposition desires peace and justice for moros and christians alike it is clear that this moa was not really intended as an instrument of peace but rather as a means for maintaining power
3332476 the milf would be better off waiting for 2010 to deal with an administration that will deal with them honestly honorably and in a manner that will include all stakeholders
3332477 the so called moa signing with milf and the attempt to postpone the armm elections are all parts of a grand scheme to divide the nation and eventually extend the presidents stay in malaca ang until after 2010
3332478 what is being offered to the milf is not a federal state you cannot have an independent state one that has its own military and can deal with foreign states within a federal system
3332479 malaca ang knows that and yet they went ahead and offered it to the milf obviously there is duplicity and bad faith in this alleged peace process
3332480 these are precisely the consequences of armed conflict because you are displacing them civilians from their homes families livelihood and basic necessities she told reporters in camp crame
3332481 where unnecessary loss of lives and properties are displayed and the right against internal displacement highlighted she said
3332482 show the true spirit of peace by respecting the rights of people
3332483 violence is never and will never be a remedy to any crisis problem or impasse
3332484 weve lost confidence in the peace panel for giving too many concessions in the talks in the end we felt even more discouraged about the moa because they couldnt even defend their position even the basic ones
3332485 by that time the bje would already have immense control of the area and it would be easier for the bje to expand and occupy the rest of mindanao
3332486 esperon admitted that it was a mistake and that the areas would no longer be included
3332487 i hold the peace panel accountable for this this pronouncement is very dangerous how about other areas which were included in the bje also by mistake
3332488 it complements our entries into china and the united states giving us access to another of the most important economies in the world

3332498 it makes no sense to ask parents of cuny and suny students to pay more to get less from the government while the families that send kids to dalton and harvard arent affected
3332499 in the end do you think both houses are going to pass what the governor said
3332500 its an election year for the legislature so i cant even see the republicans cutting that deep into programs

3332503 if they can pull this off maybe theyre not so bad after all
3332504 because of the citys hazy smoggy skies which made such a complicated display at night too difficult to pull off successfully
3332505 seeing how it worked out it was still a bit too bright compared to the actual fireworks
3332506 but most of the audience thought it was filmed live so that was mission accomplished
3332507 i was collecting my thoughts and i was sitting with a bunch of young kids and i made the decision there that we would let this part of the program finish
3332508 how come theres more democrats visiting here than republicans but they just sit in the lobby takin pictures all day and laughin their asses off
3332509 i looked the big dickhead in the eye i found him to be very straight forward and trustworthy and we had a very good dialogue i was able to get a sense of his big dickhead soul
3332510 saying our 50th state is somehow foreign does a great disservice to the hard working patriotic americans who call hawaii home for months people have been asking me when is sen obama going to come home im so glad he found time to visit his sister and his grandmother show his daughters more of his home state and relax a little hawaii is a great u s destination just ask the 5 5 million americans who visited last year for business and pleasure

3332516 i think hes good at economics and thats what john mccain needs its the only thing hes lacking
3332517 he can run a business he can run the country
3332518 i think if he doesnt pick a conservative running mate hes going to have some conservatives that stay home and dont vote and that would be a real big mistake
3332519 i dont know much about him its a new name
3332520 malil and the victim had apparently been in a dating relationship which recently ended
3332521 if we score four away from home and still cant win there is definitely something going wrong
3332522 even a 10 year old kid knows that with a minute left you whack the ball into the stands rather than try and hold onto it
3332523 even at clubs like manchester united who have a great squad most players understand why theyre on the bench here it will be hard for the manager to keep everyone happy
3332524 it was a good result but there is more to come as this team is not at its physical best
3332525 if the referee had seen that handball it would have changed everything they would never have come back into it
3332526 it was as if the ghosts from the past two seasons were still present
3332527 and psg showed a likeness of last season at their worst
3332528 i turned around to my dad and said thats exactly what i want to do
3332529 he goes its not how many times you get knocked down but its how many times you get back up and go forward carl latz said his son told him
3332530 and i told him thats exactly what this is all about and if nothing else this letter just taught you a life lesson
3332531 well the law prohibits it and the legislature enacted the laws to protect the health safety and welfare of all children
3332532 it seems totally unbelievable that somebody would even go to that extreme to send a letter to somebody let alone looking to find something about child labor laws
3332533 if my doors close and i never open again and this boy becomes successful then i will be the happiest person in the world
3332534 its strange that a kid at this age would glean onto this particular kind of music and show the intensity and kind of the ability to function as kind of 8 year old blues guy
3332535 it would be unusual to find an 8 year old who can play joe satriani licks
3332536 ive had more people tell me they say its a kids body but it has a 70 year old dude inside
3332537 i think its so much you can do on the guitar
3332538 this is in the national interest it is the image of our national music national culture especially the entrance of our national flag this is an extremely important extremely serious matter
3332539 we made the decision that the voice we would use was yang peiyis the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3332540 lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in the aspect of voice yang peiyi is flawless
3332541 we had been through several inspections they were all very strict when we rehearsed at the spot there were spectators from various divisions especially a leader from the politburo who gave us his opinion it must change
3332542 i think it is fair to both lin miaoke and yang peiyi that is to say we have a perfect voice and a perfect image and representation in our teams view combined together
3332543 adults may lie but leave the kids out of it

3332548 we will need more evidence everyone in this situation needs a binding agreement until that happens we are mobilised we are prepared for everything
3332549 there has been more damage to infrastructure and civilian casualties today
3332550 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses
3332551 if this news that military operations are stopping is correct then it is what this country needs and we can then get on to build peace
3332552 this is a beautiful place with a wonderful people they dont deserve the suffering that has been inflicted by military operations

3332569 this is a really disturbing set of data that will not go down at all well at the bank of england
3332570 the rise in consumer price inflation to a series high was well above expectations
3332571 it was definitely difficult because last night was a finals situation
3332572 i really didnt have the focus i did yesterday i was just looking to get out of my heat ive got more races ahead of me that are more important
3332573 i think emotionally it probably did take a little bit out of me but ive been very careful about what ive been doing and reacting to that
3332574 just play it down and enjoy the moment and focus on the days ahead thats why i was trying to hold back a little bit so i didnt blow my tank and i can swim fast tomorrow morning
3332575 i was so excited the whole day it was just truly spectacular
3332576 now we need to move on and swim fast theres a lot of fast swimmers i know im capable of doing a lot and thats what i plan on doing

3332584 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
3332585 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace
3332586 the purpose of the operation has been achieved the security of our peacekeeping forces and the civilian population has been restored
3332587 if we have received the order to ceasefire this does not mean that we have stopped all actions including reconnaissance
3332588 i dont think russia will feel like talking with mr saakashvili after what he did to our citizens
3332589 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people

3332591 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
3332592 the bombs that are falling on us they have an inscription on them this is for nato this is for the u s
3332593 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3332594 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3332595 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3332596 the georgians say it is their land where is our land then
3332597 i think well go in there probably a little bit more fired up a little bit sharper i think half our team its their first olympic games so coming off two wins especially a big one especially like this i think its going to help the team a lot to give us that extra confidence
3332598 were finding a way to win and thats the most important thing
3332599 were going to have to learn to play from behind and learn to play when were hit too
3332600 one of our most versatile players a great swimmer with great speed and strength
3332601 we thought getting here and getting settled in figuring out the routines and what the pool situation was i think it was an advantage for us really
3332602 im happy we did it it didnt make sense to me that so many teams were coming in three days before the tournament started because some of those teams got no time even to practice in the competition venue before they started playing i dont think the smogs been really a factor our guys havent complained about it at all
3332603 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3332604 our voters and edwards voters were the same people they were older pro union not all but maybe two thirds of them would have been for us and we would have barely beaten obama
3332605 any of the campaigns that would have tried to push that rumor would have been burned by it
3332606 i cant say i understand the rules of the media and im not sure they do either
3332607 yes yes good to see you farmer brown hello mr smith a blessed morning to you old chap
3332608 dont call it a comeback ive been here for years

3332616 i just wanted to be out on my own which i had done by the 100 metres mark that was my goal
3332617 i was out in open water and i was in the middle which makes it difficult for the other guys to see me
3332618 i guess cleveland fans arent used to watching many notre dame games youve got too many ohio state fans up here ive always been able to make all the throws
3332619 were trying to get better for the future while maintaining a team for this year
3332620 anytime you lose a player or add a player it changes the personality of the team it changes the dynamic of the team and when you lose two major players it really changes the dynamics and personality of the team
3332621 im very excited about the opportunity to actually play on a first place team in august
3332622 i had heard from walt and mr castellini mentioned sunday that arizona had claimed adam but there was no deal in place they did ask for some players
3332623 next thing i know i was called monday and they said it was probably still up then i talked to walt hes on his way to the dominican if they thought they had a deal walt would not have been going to the dominican he would have been here
3332624 he had some arm difficulties pitched though them ended up helping them win the college world series they finally operated on him a year ago
3332625 good sinker ball a battler you know hes tough to pitch as long as he did with this injury
3332626 well talk to walt tonight and see whos doing the best there
3332627 should be somebody relatively young probably somebody out of triple a
3332628 ill probably have to teach more how to be a big leaguer how to perform like a big leaguer and how to carry yourself like a big leaguer
3332629 thats tough to watch youre kind of in shock for a couple of seconds
3332630 your first thought is you want to run down there and out onto that field to be with him
3332631 i was just praying because there had been a lot of buildup and i knew he had been feeling very good
3332632 so when i got to the trainers room i didnt know what i should say
3332633 i was thinking wow hes got a good faith and he hasnt lost it you know some kids come to college they get away from their background they get into a different culture and a lot of their morals or upbringing they kind of get away from that for a few years but hes maintained his faith
3332634 i lost between 10 and 15 pounds im about 265 to 270
3332635 i feel light i feel better my leg feels 100 percent again and i approach the game differently i dont take anything for granted
3332636 moping whining and complaining about it isnt going to do anything and it could have been a lot worse
3332637 i just tried to move on and the person who helped me who didnt really know he helped me was tyson gentry
3332638 i used to do rehab all the time last fall and i used to see tyson in the weight room lifting weights
3332639 and every time i saw him it just gave me some inspiration just keep going
3332640 you remind him that first and foremost you are here for an education and dont lose sight of that
3332641 football is a great opportunity but the priority is the education
3332642 okay i just feel sad everytime i talk to him then i should stop talking to him so i wont feel sad anymore
3332643 i honestly wasnt looking to open a business but i was at a point where i didnt know what i wanted to do next

3332721 thats just more false stuff that somebody put out there i didnt even say that
3332722 its just people that hear things and then say things that are not true and then people read it and actually believe what they read you know what i mean people actually believe that all i can say is that i didnt say that me and coach woodson have a good relationship i actually was talking to him throughout the whole process before getting signed
3332723 we spent a lot of time helping him and believed in his cause
3332724 we had no idea that money was being used in that way
3332725 hes hard working and a good family man he comes from a humble background which means he understands the rights of individuals and wants justice for everybody
3332726 hes a sincere person and that resonates here he comes from a working class background and is in touch with regular everyday folks
3332727 he was full of energy he was something different from the other candidates
3332728 no one understands better than me the magnitude of what im proposing its a difficult time
3332729 we still have to spend taxpayer money to deliver the states programs the difference is that we just have less of the states funding to pay for it
3332730 an all out assault on public services and taxpayers throughout new york state
3332731 where it becomes a problem is how do we negotiate labor contracts without knowing where our state aid is going to be in the future

3332733 thirteen dead bodies and 15 injured have now been brought here

3332760 if we practise yoga without fail we will then attain physical mental and spiritual happiness and our minds will flood towards the self
3332761 the indians have found an answer in the guru system put trust in the guru once you have found the right one and he she will take you on a journey of transformation from darkness into light
3332762 is a phrase heard too often in the mouths of yoga teachers presumably yoga class is higher and better than the aerobics class that plays loud music next door and disturbs our serenity after all we address the persons spiritual development not just their butt line
3332763 supposedly we do not allow religion in schools and yoga is a religion
3332764 if youre not seeking the god of the bible his power then by default youre in the other camp the other source of supernatural power is satan
3332765 what would god think of his children dancing with the false religions of the enemy
3332766 the class was not part of the mandatory schools curriculum and the yoga component focuses on stretching and breathing
3332767 there is not an intent to have a philosophic or religious intent for this were trying to deal with the issue of obesity were trying to find as many ways as possible to engage our children in healthy and active lifestyles

3332776 they say that this mountain arunachala is the seat of shiva and for thousands of years this place has been a magnet for saints

3332778 financial structure is the most critical issue that we face
3332779 we can capitalize on the fear factor segment think of it an entire line of xtreme burgers from the king the anus steak burger the spicy chicken spleen sandwich and the crispy fish intestine sandwich genius

3332790 des de ciu no direm que no a la compareixen a del president rodr guez zapatero davant la diputaci permanent del congr s per informar sobre el seu incompliment en laplicaci de lestatut en mat ria de finan ament
3332791 les seves explicacions tenen poca import ncia perqu ja sha evidenciat que els seus incompliments es deuen a manca de voluntat pol tica
3332792 el realment important s poder presentar des de catalunya una proposta unit ria al govern central
3332793 no nom s podem estar dacord en qu no estem dacord amb la proposta del ministre solbes sin que hem destar units per defensar all que volem per a catalunya
3332794 crec que a principis de setembre es podr presentar una proposta catalana
3332795 ja sest produint un fet molt positiu partits com erc que va votar en contra de lestatut o com el psc amb lactual president montilla al front que va presentar esmenes per rebaixar el text avui es trenquen la cara per defensar all que lestatut estableix en mat ria de finan ament
3332796 des dels seus c rrecs al govern aquesta s la seva obligaci del conseller castells i del presidnet montilla
3332797 des de les files del psc fora del govern existeix un silenci preocupant
3332798 per poder for ar rodr guez zapatero a executar lestatut segons pujol
3332799 si ell no executa el 100 dall que lestatut estableix sobre finan ament els partits catalans incloent hi el psc no hem daprovar els seus pressupostos
3332800 si ell no compleix amb catalunya catalunya no t perqu complir amb el govern central
3332801 seguir treballant fins l ltim minut com estem fent des de fa mesos colze a colze amb el govern de la generalitat per defensar el compliment de lestatut

3332803 its supposed to be a parody but its really a mockery of the word retarded
3332804 its setting us back its purposeful and hateful to people that have disabilities
3332805 it means we can be afraid of things we dont know and use words without thinking and without repercussions were not against humor we love humor but lets understand the humor that were using
3332806 our message is pretty clear we need people with intellectual disabilities portrayed with humanity and dignity
3332807 we dont think its fair that this population is singled out
3332808 the word and the portrayal of a mentally challenged person are a source of ridicule
3332809 it makes people a combination of furious and just really disturbed at the end of the day this has to be a teachable moment its not about the movie its about being sensitive to the human dignity of others
3332810 this film is so offensive that it brought several organizations together
3332811 as far as im concerned the whole thing is a satire
3332812 i think its perfectly fine there was no harm involved it wasnt done meanly in satire everybody gets a little banged up thats the whole point of it
3332813 so far there has yet to be any report specifying whether the three victims in asahan were positively or negatively infected with the bird flu virus if the results are positive we will have to monitor the area longer
3332814 we are on full alert to monitor developments of a bird flu outbreak in asahan a team from the world health organization is still there to investigate the case
3332815 the three people died following the discovery of dead poultry but we dont know whether or not it was the cause
3332816 we have so far carried out various anticipatory measures to curb the virus spread and we urge people to remain alert

3332848 i think hes a fine man hes a good government guy very fiscally responsible
3332849 the partys preference of course was to have john tyler
3332850 i think it was a political decision not to give him the advantage of incumbency
3332851 i thought it was important to replace him with somebody with business background
3332852 when i heard about it i felt really hurt inside
3332853 i cannot believe a writer could write something like that its the not the way that we want to be portrayed we have feelings we dont like the word retard we are people were just like any other people out there we want to be ourselves and not be discriminated against
3332854 there were parts of the movie where i laughed but it seems to me that the movie tried really hard to go too far and then pull back on everything that was offensive except the issue of people with intellectual disabilities i just think ben stiller and the people involved in this movie just didnt think it was going to be offensive
3332855 no changes or cuts to the film will be made

3332866 c 1 samuel 18 1 20 30 these verses have been adduced as evidence in support of the claim that the much vaunted friendship between david and jonathon was a homosexual relationship there is however no hint of erotic behaviour in the biblical text and the shame described in 20 30 related to jonathons sic disloyalty to his father and family when siding with david against saul indeed it was the panels view that the current preoccupation with homosexuality could devalue and cast unnecessary suspicion upon those wholesome relationships that are possible between same sex friends
3332867 lancashire county cricket club has decided not to offer dominic cork a contract for the 2009 season
3332868 this decision was made with the longer term development of the playing staff in mind and to allow the side to evolve providing younger players the opportunity to grow into the team
3332869 37 year old cork has been a great ambassador for lancashire both on and off the field and is fully committed to finishing the championship season with the club it would be a fitting end if he was to complete his old trafford career on a high note by helping lancashire to win the elusive championship title

3332875 the positive sentiment seen at the end of first quarter 2008 that the credit crisis may be easing was short lived as trading conditions deteriorated significantly in the second half of may in particular for assets related to u s residential real estate as well as other structured credit positions

3332878 our review has clearly revealed the weaknesses associated with the integrated one firm business model

3332887 recent escalation in military engagement between russia and georgia poses a threat to certain key oil and gas pipelines which transit georgia
3332888 there have been no deliberate attempts to damage that pipeline

3332890 demonstrate that it is a volatile region it is a crucial region for getting caspian oil to consumer markets
3332891 with negligible domestic oil production unlike some of its caspian neighbours georgias significance to global oil and gas markets is as a transit corridor
3332892 threat of an attack on the btc baku tblisi ceyhan pipeline poses the bigger risk to oil markets it is clear that more generally georgia is a key energy transit hub in the caucasus region and a country of significant strategic importance to energy markets
3332893 the outage on the btc pipeline and recent hostilities in the caucasus highlight the potentially precarious nature of pipeline energy supplies in the region
3332894 with the btc currently closed disruption to georgian energy infrastructure further limits the possibility of getting caspian oil and gas to markets
3332895 renewed flows through georgia expected from september could be further delayed if the line is damaged during the russia georgia conflict
3332896 along the same corridor runs the south caucasus gas pipeline a branch of this pipeline continues through to the russian port of tuapse transiting the region of abkhazia another georgian area affected by separatist action where russian troops are reportedly also being mobilised
3332897 total products leaving georgian ports typically average 50 000 70 000 barrels per day

3333028 its an amazing opportunity lara is strong athletic confident and independent so its a huge responsibility to take on her role
3333029 shes got everything that a woman aspires to be like and everything that a man would like to meet
3333030 shes still a leading icon in games but maybe shes not as big as she used to be
3333031 the last couple of games have had their ups and downs and weve yet to see a true next generation lara croft video game
3333032 designed with an incredible attention to detail that creates a truly believable world and delivers a new level of challenge and choice
3333033 shes still as relevant today as she ever was whether she can surprise us still remains to be seen
3333034 lara croft is an iconic gaming character she just goes from strength to strength
3333035 with global warming and a world thats running out of oil the last thing governments should do is add taxes on something that uses no oil and produces no carbon
3333036 a digital download is the greenest way to buy music movies and software since it requires no driving to the store no delivery vans and no plastics or packaging
3333037 the retail sale lease licensing or use of specified digital products transferred to or accessed by subscribers or consumers
3333038 sales of digital audio works music digital audiovisual works movies music videos tv shows and digital books
3333039 most of the proponents of the nexus legislation would concede that given this is an election year its unlikely the legislation will pass
3333040 golden state retailers would be at a competitive disadvantage to out of state companies
3333041 adopt a regulation subjecting digital property transfers to the sales and use tax law state and local revenues could increase by approximately 114 million annually
3333042 a series of related images which when shown in succession impart an impression of motion together with accompanying sounds if any
3333043 i suspect we will see the next 14 attempting to address it in the next legislative cycle
3333044 as these technologies meet there is this question of what is digital goods and what is software
3333045 to define where technology is today and how it should be taxed
3333046 provided that the non electronic version of that item was not exempt
3333047 the way our statute is currently we probably could tax them but we should probably have the legislature have the final say
3333048 the sale of digital music delivered electronically to customers for download on their computers constitutes the sale of intangible property and is not subject to sales or use tax
3333049 you know you dont have to be overly dramatic like that honestly i could say that came straight from an adam west batman movie or something you know puurrrrr fect from a cat honestly

3333056 i wouldve been hard pressed to come up with an example where electronic wedding invitations would be acceptable except when real life intervenes
3333057 in the past i never would have thought to use an electronic invitation because i dont know if it was as much of a formality as it was about brand awareness and being so protective over how the brand was portrayed
3333058 people always wanted to speak to the hostess when they made a reservation at a restaurant now they just use opentable
3333059 there was a whole segment of event types that people just did not want to use electronic invitations for
3333060 id like to believe that because of how we do things you also get the aesthetic aspect of it you dont have to sacrifice it
3333061 not having to use paper is huge when youre trying to be eco conscious
3333062 its better for the environment its cheaper if not free and youre collecting the majority of your rsvps in a place where theres no human error people either hit yes no or maybe and itll download into a list
3333063 there are always ways to do paper invitations in a cost effective way
3333064 you can get paper print them yourself hand write them
3333065 that point is actually quite well taken because it does create quite a lot of paper waste what might be interesting is to see if there are people or companies that come up with very low impact ways of generating invitations that are either easily recyclable or directly reusable
3333066 if you really know your guests and you really know its a preference for them i think thats great
3333067 at new york fashion week youve got 12 days of shows and events and its highly highly competitive
3333068 if you dont send out a paper invitation it doesnt work theres something about it landing on someones desk and having it be tactile
3333069 a large not quite a quarter yet but about 20 percent of our events are actually wedding related

3333098 all right you lazy bums ive done all the work till now its time you went out into the real world and fended for yourself
3333099 all residents at iden road will be able to have a say on how their street should change including ideas ranging from tree planting and reducing traffic to new art installations
3333100 we are confident that this project will dramatically improve the physical environment and enhance the lives of local residents
3333101 i am really looking forward to this chance to brighten up our street because it definitely needs some green spaces to replace the grey concrete
3333102 living on a cul de sac has made us all a close knit bunch but making the street look attractive will give everyone living here a lift and encourage people to socialise outside their front doors even more
3333103 the success of this scheme will hopefully pave the way for a new approach to creating and managing the streetscene
3333104 it seems odds on that house prices will continue to head rapidly south
3333105 elevated affordability pressures on potential house buyers stem from high house prices modest disposable income growth and the squeeze on purchasing power coming from soaring utility bills and high food prices while very tight credit conditions have led to markedly fewer and more expensive mortgages being available
3333106 the current issue affecting the market is largely about the supply of credit a very different situation to the early 90s which was about high interest rates and unemployment
3333107 the long term demand for housing remains high and the fundamentals of the economy are sound with low unemployment and historically low interest rates
3333108 a triple whammy of cracking down on would be dumpers quicker clearing up by councils and soaring metal prices are helping to win the battle against unsightly old bangers being left on our streets
3333109 people tell us that these eyesores make them feel unsafe in their own neighbourhood and figures like these show councils up and down the country are working hard to make people feel safe and secure
3333110 a few years ago youd have to pay someone to take your old car away but now scrap metal dealers will pay you up to 1 000 for the pleasure
3333111 over 250 councils have signed up to the lgas reputation campaign which says that councils should aim to clear up abandoned vehicles within 24 hours these eyesores attract crime and the public rightly expects them to be removed quickly
3333112 with over 80 000 vehicles still being reported as abandoned last year theres no room for complacency and local authorities will continue to do all they can to make sure that cars arent dumped on our streets and when they are theyre cleared up as a top priority
3333113 aku berserah diri aslam tu kepada tuhan seru sekalian alam
3333114 sesungguhnya aku telah diberi petunjuk oleh tuhanku ke arah jalan yang lurus yaitu agama yang tegak ajaran ibrahim yang hanif dan tidaklah dia termasuk orang orang musyrik
3333115 sesungguhnya sembahyangku darmabaktiku hidupku dan matiku adalah untuk allah seru sekalian alam tiada serikat bagi nya begitulah aku diperintahkan dan aku adalah yang pertama dari kalangan orang orang yang pasrah
3333116 demi allah ia tidak beriman demi allah ia tidak beriman
3333117 demi dia yang diriku ada di tangan nya kamu tidak akan masuk surga sebelum kamu beriman dan kamu tidak beriman sebelum kamu saling mencintai belumkah aku beri petunjuk kamu tentang sesuatu yang jika kamu kerjakan kamu akan saling mencintai sebarkanlah perdamaian di antara sesama kamu
3333118 ihsan ialah bahwa engkau menyembah allah seakan akan engkau melihat nya dan kalau engkau tidak melihat nya maka sesungguhnya dia melihat engkau
3333119 telah berkata imam muhy al din ibn alarabi ra adapun empat akhlak itu maka siapa saja yang menjalankan keempat empatnya ia sungguh telah menggabungkan semua kebajikan yaitu 1 tazhim hurumat al muslimin artinya menjunjung kehormatan semua orang islam 2 khidmat al fuqara wa al masakin artinya melayani kaum fakir miskin 3 wa l inshaf min nafsihi artinya jujur dan adil mengenai diri sendiri 4 tark al intishar la ha artinya tidak memberi pertolongan hanya semata karena kepentingan diri sendiri

3333138 arsenal are one of the strongest teams we could have met
3333139 but for our young team it will be something special the young players can get a lot of experience in these big matches not only now but with one eye on the future
3333140 in the two matches against arsenal we are not just the underdogs but we are very big underdogs
3333141 nobody will expect fc twente to beat arsenal we have nothing to lose
3333142 i am really impressed by the organisation of fc twente
3333143 i see people who are working for the club with passion and want to go further
3333144 on the pitch i found a group with a very good fitness level so we could immediately work on the performance
3333145 looking back to last season is useless that was the first thing i made clear to the squad you cannot live on the success you had before
3333146 we want to go on down the line that brought success before and that is what we are working on now
3333147 at the draw it soon became clear we would get a strong opponent and arsenal is certainly that
3333148 they are one of europes best and they will be two very difficult matches for us
3333149 of course we are the underdogs but in football anything is possible

3333158 we are grateful for the invitation that allows us to observe the events of the beijing olympics
3333159 one of them won us the game in ghana after we were 2 0 down she scored two and created one but when it was time for the olympics the coach jossy lad dropped them and went with people who pleased him the result is what we got

3333163 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
3333164 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
3333165 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
3333166 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
3333167 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
3333168 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
3333169 this the olympics are the sports biggest bang youd think the ioc would love that

3333206 wimax is a little late to be a serious challenger to lte
3333207 the prices we pay in sa for mobile data are globally competitive which is quite astonishing
3333208 this is because of the aggressive behaviour of our mobile operators who have just decided they are going to own this space
3333209 uhurunet still needs to get its ducks in a row
3333210 it is challenged because it is very dependent on governments many governments equals many politicians uhurunet may get there but will have to be significantly government owned because investors will have already piled into the other initiatives

3333238 although pelecanos pays homage to his crime writing roots uncoiling a lethal subplot involving no good charles baker that spurs a fitting if bloody resolution it is the central questions of how men can have purpose and atone for their sins that makes the turnaround an indelible read

3333246 it is not the healthy who need a doctor but the sick
3333247 this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation that christ jesus came into the world to save sinners of whom i am chief
3333248 when jesus heard it he saith unto them they that are whole have no need of the physician but they that are sick i came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance
3333249 for the son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost
3333250 even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many
3333251 pilate therefore said unto him art thou a king then jesus answered thou sayest that i am a king to this end was i born and for this cause came i into the world that i should bear witness unto the truth every one that is of the truth heareth my voice
3333252 for i came down from heaven not to do mine own will but the will of him that sent me
3333253 i am come a light into the world that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness
3333254 i am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly
3333255 and jesus said for judgment i am come into this world that they which see not might see and that they which see might be made blind
3333256 and he said unto them let us go into the next towns that i may preach there also for therefore came i forth
3333257 now is my soul troubled and what shall i say father save me from this hour but for this cause came i unto this hour
3333258 think not that i am come to destroy the law or the prophets i am not come to destroy but to fulfil
3333259 think not that i am come to send peace on earth i came not to send peace but a sword for i am come to set a man at variance against his father and the daughter against her mother and the daughter in law against her mother in law
3333260 herein is love not that we loved god but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins
3333261 then said jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father hath sent me even so send i you
3333262 herein is love not that we loved god but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins
3333263 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god
3333264 unto you first god having raised up his son jesus sent him to bless you in turning away every one of you from his iniquities
3333265 but when the fulness of the time was come god sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons
3333266 for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit

3333303 oil demand data are coming in weaker on an underlying trend basis

3333683 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed

3333688 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves

3333701 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
3333702 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
3333703 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit

3333741 the results of the survey so far show that although most companies understand the importance of having business continuity and disaster recovery plans in place there seems to be a knowledge gap when it comes to understanding the technologies that are currently available to deliver reliable and fast recovery in the event of a system failure these days it is not enough to blindly trust that backups are being completed properly businesses and the regulatory environment in which we all exist demand fast and reliable recovery time objectives for it systems such is the pace at which a modern company transacts business these days that those who are without their it for any great length of time are losing serious money customers are also becoming a lot more aware of the information that companies hold and are getting less and less forgiving about delivery disruption let alone the thought of their sensitive data being transported in a an unencrypted and readable format
3333742 this change in causes of data loss can possibly be attributed to improvements in software and hardware resiliency in the last two years which has reduced the number of hardware and software failures affecting computers changing the way these threats need to be addressed in business continuity and disaster recovery plans moving forward

3333752 this survey is deliberately targeted at an age group that is being asked to choose its education and career path whilst this science statistic should worry uk plc and the governments of today and tomorrow the message is clear if we can educate them on the correlation between science and the gadgets they cant live without and spark their interest before choosing their gcse options we can influence the future of british industry

3334003 hang on where the frick is the local petrol station
3334004 did you wildly underestimate how long this project was going to take you to do
3334005 well when we were looking at moving down here and you wanting to do this container was part of the deal you told me it would be done in two weeks max and when it wasnt finished after about a month you got all angry with me and said it was all my fault because i hadnt been letting you work on it enough but if id let you work 24 hours a day 7 days a week it still wouldnt have been done in two weeks would it because its been nearly three months now
3334006 so either you wildly underestimated how long it was going to take you or you knew full well that it was a four month job but you lied to me and said it would only be two weeks because you knew otherwise id never agree to you taking it on
3334007 yeah i did wildly underestimate how long it was going to take me
3334008 well i didnt want to admit i was wrong but when you put it like that

3334108 to me the fact that a character smokes weed isnt really what i hang my hat on necessarily to me its just like arthur the alcoholic played by james bond arent the same because they both drink so i would kind of equate it to that theyre different guys who both have a similar habit to me theyre very different guys though
3334109 its this shit called wizard smoke i didnt like it but franco didnt have that hard of a time with it franco will smoke anything one thing about this guy if you put it in front of him hell smoke it its like non alcoholic weed its like the odouls of weed

3334126 i wouldve been hard pressed to come up with an example where electronic wedding invitations would be acceptable except when real life intervenes
3334127 in the past i never would have thought to use an electronic invitation because i dont know if it was as much of a formality as it was about brand awareness and being so protective over how the brand was portrayed
3334128 image was so important the paper stock the font we would have invitation designers and wed go through multiple edits
3334129 people always wanted to speak to the hostess when they made a reservation at a restaurant now they just use opentable
3334130 there was a whole segment of event types that people just did not want to use electronic invitations for
3334131 id like to believe that because of how we do things you also get the aesthetic aspect of it you dont have to sacrifice it
3334132 not having to use paper is huge when youre trying to be eco conscious
3334133 its better for the environment its cheaper if not free and youre collecting the majority of your rsvps in a place where theres no human error people either hit yes no or maybe and itll download into a list
3334134 there are always ways to do paper invitations in a cost effective way
3334135 you can get paper print them yourself hand write them
3334136 that point is actually quite well taken because it does create quite a lot of paper waste what might be interesting is to see if there are people or companies that come up with very low impact ways of generating invitations that are either easily recyclable or directly reusable
3334137 if you really know your guests and you really know its a preference for them i think thats great
3334138 at new york fashion week youve got 12 days of shows and events and its highly highly competitive
3334139 if you dont send out a paper invitation it doesnt work theres something about it landing on someones desk and having it be tactile

3334358 in actual fact isnt it true we are all born into this world in a relationship with god everyone has a relationship with god atheists have a personal relationship with god god is not separated from any of us the question is whether the god who is near is near in wrath or forgiveness if your way of explaining the gospel doesnt get you within two seconds to jesus christ and his work on the cross it is not a biblical way of presenting salvation you do have a personal relationship with god now the question is do you have a mediator jesus christ if you dont than that relationship is one of wrath and its judgment

3334434 there are probably more unsaved people in my pews than i want to acknowledge in the past ive made the mistake as a pastor of trying to assure people of their salvation when they never possessed it to begin with here are people who profess to be christians but they have no interest in gods word they never pray they dont want to be in church there is absolutely no fruit in their life why should we give false security to people like that the bible certainly gives no assurance of salvation for such people it comes down to the question what place does obedience have in the life of a christian what does grace say is my responsibility in marriage in friendships in the church i dont believe that obedience earns gods salvation of our souls but it certainly earns gods favor in our lives

3334454 the need for repentance is another fundamental postulate of the christian faith and it is also one of the truths that people most resent teaching about repentance utterly infuriates people today as it did these rulers in jerusalem there is no difference whatsoever in this respect between the first and the twentieth centuries the fact that the message of repentance is regarded as a very great insult is further proof of that fatal self righteousness that is always the greatest hindrance to acceptance of the gospel message

3334470 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3334471 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3334472 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3334473 whether widespread recognition of gay marriage and thus the legitimating of homosexual relationships might either increase the number of homosexuals or undermine heterosexual marriage i do not think either consequence is likely homosexuals are more open about their sexual identity and this creates an impression that there is more homosexuality than there used to be and there may indeed be more homosexual behavior but the preference appears to be unchanged so parents probably need not worry that recognizing gay marriage will increase the likelihood of their childs turning out to be homosexual
3334474 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3334475 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3334491 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3334492 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3334519 we will need more evidence everyone in this situation needs a signed binding agreement
3334520 until that happens we are mobilised we are prepared for everything i do appreciate it mr medvedevs gesture but there has been more damage to infrastructure and civilian casualties today

3334549 i had a spell on loan there when i was 18 they were in the conference at the time it was my first taste of senior football and it was a bit of a culture shock to be honest
3334550 my first game was away to aldershot and it was a tough day
3334551 in the first minute i was involved in a collision with their centre forward which left me a bit worse for wear for the rest of the game
3334552 i got hit in the private parts so you can imagine i was in a bit of pain and ive got painful memories of my first match
3334553 it was an old style ground with the fans tight to the pitch but it was a good experience
3334554 i was only there for a month so i didnt really get a feel for the club but its a good club and if selected it would be good to play against them
3334555 training was basically on the local park and i went there in the winter so you can imagine that going further up north it was colder than wolverhampton
3334556 it didnt go a day without raining so it wasnt great but it didnt really bother me because im not too big not to go to a club like that and learn
3334557 its a normal part of your development and the football is the main thing to make sure i keep going in the right direction so im thankful for them for that
3334558 i only trained there twice a week but think they were full time you go there and you realise how lucky you are to be at a club like wolves
3334559 i went there and came back thinking im going to do my best to make sure i dont play conference football
3334560 its a good level you have to look at players such as michael kightly who have come from there
3334561 kites was playing in that league two years ago but now he could play in the premier league so there are good players in that league
3334562 i was only there for a month so i wasnt really there long enough to bond with the players although ive noticed some of the names from their games are the same
3334563 i think there are at least four or five players still there from my time it was quite a long time ago so things have changed quite a lot
3334564 were in the same hotel at the moment so we eat together most nights if he wants to ask me anything he can
3334565 have i given him advice youre making me feel old he knows he can talk to me about anything and were open with each other
3334566 hes got a lot of talent and has definitely shown that so long may that continue
3334567 he got a bit aggressive with that goal celebration so we might have to have a word there i was delighted for him
3334568 we did enough to win and the goals we gave away werent the best but we can focus on putting that right
3334569 its a learning thing but we dont want to make too many mistakes before we get our first win on the board
3334570 we had to push in the second half because we were 2 1 down but weve got good players so we knew the chances were going to come
3334571 stacky pulled a few saves out that he probably shouldnt have but thats a positive we can take out
3334572 undp is taking the matter very seriously we have met with donors to keep them informed
3334573 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
3334574 we wondered how everybody else did its interesting to know that we came out ahead of one that was short listed
3334575 it raised my eyebrows a bit when mississippi was selected
3334576 obviously there were factors other than what they were looking in the site visits the group that did the site visits were scientists and know what they were looking for i dont know what dhs was looking for
3334577 we were surprised when some of the things we felt were our strengths were turned back on us as weaknesses
3334578 you told me more about the process than i know
3334579 i havent talked to anyone about it not to jay cohen or anyone
3334580 mississippis governor does not know of one dhs is in mississippi right now for a site visit and just confirmed with us that there is no scoring system
3334581 mississippi has put forth a compelling application and it does not surprise me that someone might be trying to diminish the strength of our proposal by spreading this rumor
3334582 it appears that the undersecretary responsible for this program may have corrupted the site selection process by putting his thumb on the scale in favor of a particular site and its contractor in violation of his own rules and over the objections of his own advisers
3334583 this raises the question of whether dhs is interested in bioresearch or just shameless empire building
3334584 if any of the five finalists scored lower than those eliminated from the process weve got a big problem on our hands
3334585 while i take the committees concerns to heart i do not concur with the low scores
3334586 did not appropriately consider the unique contributions certain consortia committed to make in their proposals
3334587 these funds will be transferred by the palestinian authority of mahmud abbas they are for paying the salaries of abbass people
3334588 with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly but that misconduct took place for a short period in 2006 it ended then
3334589 john made a terrible mistake in 2006 we began a long and painful process in 2006 a process oddly made somewhat easier with my diagnosis in march of 2007

3334603 for some time now ive been aware that there are fewer days ahead than there are behind
3334604 what youre having now is legitimate full blown persecution theyre trying to eradicate this movement before it can gain traction and become a popular movement like it has in america
3334605 in the courts it is in danger home schooling is very strange to the german people they have no experience with this kind of education
3334606 the public has a legitimate interest in countering the rise of parallel societies that are based on religion or motivated by different world views and in integrating minorities into the population as a whole
3334607 germany does not want the kind of citizens that home schooling produces theyve seen how the home schooling movement in the u s developed and theyre very keen on that not happening here
3334608 what were trying to do is get a house just across the border so were living in austria where our visa comes from so the government cant control us with home schooling
3334609 we left our home country and came over here and god supplied this house and the environment and just everything and now theyre saying no you cant stay youve got to leave its hard
3334610 their officials are actually encouraged to home school and not put their children into american schools and into foreign schools
3334611 i know of schools right in our area where its not just mixed swimming but mixed showering after the swim class is over and mixed locker rooms and then they leave and go to the next class
3334612 these things in the school the official state school they destroy the children and we teach the children in the things of god and the people in the official school teach the children in other things against god
3334613 this is a battle to eradicate spiritual life from every person in europe to eradicate spirituality and christianity from the culture

3334620 i have opponents in this race who do not want to change the constitution but i believe its a lot easier to change the constitution than it would be to change the word of the living god and thats what we need to do is amend the constitution so its in gods standards rather than trying to change gods standards so it lines up with some contemporary view of how we treat each other and how we treat the family

3334654 recent escalation in military engagement between russia and georgia poses a threat to certain key oil and gas pipelines which transit georgia
3334655 there have been no deliberate attempts to damage that pipeline
3334656 we think it any attack would be counter active even though it can happen in a conflict
3334657 demonstrate that it is a volatile region it is a crucial region for getting caspian oil to consumer markets
3334658 with negligible domestic oil production unlike some of its caspian neighbours georgias significance to global oil and gas markets is as a transit corridor
3334659 threat of an attack on the btc baku tblisi ceyhan pipeline poses the bigger risk to oil markets it is clear that more generally georgia is a key energy transit hub in the caucasus region and a country of significant strategic importance to energy markets
3334660 the outage on the btc pipeline and recent hostilities in the caucasus highlight the potentially precarious nature of pipeline energy supplies in the region
3334661 with the btc currently closed disruption to georgian energy infrastructure further limits the possibility of getting caspian oil and gas to markets
3334662 renewed flows through georgia expected from september could be further delayed if the line is damaged during the russia georgia conflict
3334663 along the same corridor runs the south caucasus gas pipeline a branch of this pipeline continues through to the russian port of tuapse transiting the region of abkhazia another georgian area affected by separatist action where russian troops are reportedly also being mobilised
3334664 total products leaving georgian ports typically average 50 000 70 000 barrels per day
3334665 latest reports suggest that oil exports from poti have ceased while only partial operations are currently possible from supsa and batumi
3334666 please be careful when alighting from the train as the heavy rain has made it slippery
3334667 the situation in georgia is very difficult because russia is doing everything possible to occupy the country
3334668 the cold war has long ended but the mentality of the cold war has stayed firmly in the minds of several u s diplomats
3334669 completed a significant part of the operations to oblige georgia the georgian authorities to restore peace to south ossetia
3334670 we left behind all the equipment in the hospital and 80 bodies in the morgue
3334671 if tbilisi comes under threat i will inform the residents 12 hours in advance
3334672 we wont touch the citizens but we will liquidate anyone in uniform
3334673 if the georgian troops dont take advantage of this opportunity then an operation to eliminate them will begin
3334674 concerned that this process may not be capable of providing adequate protection against hazards that will only come to light once the spacecraft is in operation
3334675 that has made some folks uncomfortable but guess what were not done yet
3334676 if we tried to please everybody the spacecraft would not get off the ground
3334677 the funding over the next two years became too tight for us so i had to adjust the schedule for that
3334678 banks like morgan stanley and merrill lynch are playing musical chairs
3334679 why are they doing this they want to keep the talent
3334680 some are being told i dont care if your wife has to stay here this is what you have to do
3334681 ive spoken to people who three or four years ago literally refused to relocate now theyre open to moving
3334682 they do not see growth or change in this market in the near future
3334683 in the past everything was done out of new york and that was the place to be
3334684 but now everyone has decided to go local and to go quite aggressively
3334685 people understand that this is important its clear that growing our franchises in key emerging markets is an important strategic priority
3334686 pools of capital will move to where the industry sees an expansion of opportunities
3334687 i dont know whether its as much theres not enough to do here so well go somewhere else
3334688 rather its more of a reflection of our clients and the growing businesses in china india and middle east
3334689 is there a set time that i expect to be in asia
3334690 not really i could see spending my whole career here
3334691 we did what we thought was right only to be told we were wrong
3334692 we were going back and forth from our local management entity and to the state for clarification and each time we would get referred back to the other
3334693 we have heard these complaints and we have tightened those definitions
3334694 help those who are diagnosed with mental illnesses as well as those who are suffering from drug abuse to make a smooth transition that is to learn to live survive and to thrive in their community
3334695 did not rise to the level of community support services adding that now everyone including providers are on the same track
3334696 we recognize that there are lots of good providers out there who are providing quality care this action wont affect them it does put some problem providers on notice that we are watching what they are doing and wont pay for services that arent clinically necessary
3334697 if a client has a problem with severe anxiety or a social phobia we may take the client to a store to help that client cope with crowds whatever it takes to treat that client we live in a small rural community and resources are limited we use what is available to treat our clients symptoms following their diagnosis
3334698 these clients are now frantic and wondering whats going to happen to them and how they are going to cope with their symptoms
3334699 we are handling all appeals as expeditiously as possible said deen
3334700 keep in mind that quite a number of appeals are being settled for less than the original amount owed
3334701 georgia in a way is suffering for all that happened to russia in the last 20 years
3334702 washington and the administration are playing an extremely dirty game
3334703 they will show putin as an occupier even if putin is doing nothing
3334704 he is playing the game which is designed by putin
3334705 now he can cruise the volga for all the remaining years or can go right to the bahamas
3334706 i must admit that for the first time in my life i felt admiration for the skill with which vladimir putin maintains his power
3334707 i would say you have a situation in which the russians have come to the red line
3334708 if we catch them in the toilet well rub them out in the outhouse
3334709 i will recommend to conduct the operation so that nothing on you will grow again
3334710 he has such a visceral attitude toward saakashvili that that seems to drown out anything else that anyone says to him
3334711 the odds are the retired folks theyre getting pensions theyre getting social security they have investment assets they own a house so theyre better off than somebody who is 30 or 40 years younger whos trying to buy a house and trying to start saving
3334712 the proposal would exempt comparatively well off though not affluent senior citizens from taxes and give them a benefit not generally available to working americans
3334713 helps only those low income seniors who currently pay income taxes those too poor to owe any tax arguably those most in need would get no benefit
3334714 this is a really disturbing set of data that will not go down at all well at the bank of england
3334715 the rise in to a series high was well above expectations
3334716 it is not a matter in which the court has any control or authority the matter is now discontinued
3334717 i do find that result extremely surprising and it reminds me of the 19th century legal comment

3334723 the funding over the next two years became too tight for us so i had to adjust the schedule for that
3334724 if the contrast between the candidates on social issues is heightened enough then those evangelical voters will eventually come back on board
3334725 yeah he doesnt seem very interested in campaigning on those social issues
3334726 unless he turns it around or gets surrogates to make that case for him some evangelicals might sit it out

3334796 en de hel is zeker de beloofde plaats voor hen allen
3334797 zij heeft zeven poorten en elke poort heeft een gedeelte hunner toegewezen gekregen
3334798 het is iets schadelijks blijft dus gedurende de menstruatie van de vrouwen weg en gaat niet tot haar in voordat zij hersteld zijn maar wanneer zij zich hebben gereinigd gaat tot haar in zoals god het u heeft bevolen god bemint hen die zich tot hem wenden en zich rein houden
3334799 het verbod van het lezen van de koran voor de menstruerende vrouw heeft geen basis in zowel de koran als de sunnah
3334800 de menstruerende vrouw of de persoon in junub onreinheid wegens seksuele gemeenschap mag niets uit de koran lezen
3334801 komt leest mijn boek koran 69 20 voorzeker ik wist dat ik mijn afrekening tegemoet moest gaan
3334802 lees het boek uw eigen ziel is op deze dag als rekenaar tegen uzelf voldoende
3334803 wist je dat je in het paradijs kinderen kan krijgen
3334804 die vielen selbstst ndigen dienststellen effizient zu koordinieren um die rechtssicherheit der freiwilligen sowie die sicherheit der bev lkerung zu steigern wurde mit dem 144 notruf nieder sterreich erfolgreich umgesetzt
3334805 um die versorgungsqualit t weiter zu verbessern werden die mitarbeiter laufend geschult
3334806 het is aan mij geopenbaard dat een groep der djinn heeft geluisterd naar de
3334807 o edelen welke onder u zal mij een passende troon voor haar brengen voordat zij onderdanig tot mij komt
3334808 ik zal deze tot u brengen voordat gij van uw kamp opstaat en zeker heb ik daar macht over en ik ben betrouwbaar
3334809 wilt gij er iemand plaatsen die er onheil zal stichten en bloed zal vergieten terwijl wij u verheerlijken met de lof die u toekomt en uw heiligheid prijzen
3334810 vrees niet want wij zijn tot het volk van lot gezonden
3334811 vrede zij u gaat de hemel binnen voor hetgeen gij deedt
3334812 de doodsengel aan wie gij toevertrouwd zijt zal uw ziel nemen dan zult gij tot uw heer worden teruggebracht
3334813 vrede zij over u omdat gij geduldig waart ziet hoe uitstekend is het uiteindelijke tehuis
3334814 o malik laat uw heer een einde aan ons maken
3334815 ik ben met u versterkt de gelovigen ik boezem ontzag in de harten der ongelovigen slaat daarom hun hoofd af en slaat alle toppen van hun vingers af
3334816 de eerste 20 verdiepingen zal ik grapjes vertellen om ons bezig te houden dan kan een ander verhalen met wijsheid vertellen de volgende 20 verdiepingen uiteindelijk kan de laatste persoon 20 verdiepingen met droevige verhalen vullen
3334817 mijn eerste droevig verhaaltje is dat ik de kamersleutel in de auto heb achtergelaten
3334818 asjhadoe an la ilaha ilallah wa asjhadoe ana mohammadan abdoehoe wa rasoeloehoe
3334819 ik getuig dat er geen god is dan allah en ik getuig dat mohammed zijn dienaar en boodschapper is
3334820 dat is ook haast onmogelijk want je maakt een sprong naar een andere cultuur
3334821 eigen kleren haardracht jargon en boeken dat maakt de islam tot een soort religieuze concurrent van subculturen als gabber gothic en skate
3334822 in de jaren zestig was het marxisme populair in de jaren zeventig de nieuwe religieuze bewegingen en nu blijkbaar de islam
3334823 het is een gevoel een intense zoetheid van geloof die niet te omschrijven is
3334824 ik dacht wat hebben die meiden wat ik niet heb
3334825 ik kwam er door boeken achter dat dit de laatste geopenbaarde religie is aan de koran is geen letter veranderd daarom moest dit de juiste godsdienst zijn
3334826 ik zou een slecht voorbeeld zijn voor moslimvrouwen die moeten integreren
3334827 pero eso qu es pero quien es la vieja de los de ah a qui n est atacando qu ha dicho qu ha dicho
3334828 laat een gelovige man geen afschuw hebben van zijn gelovige vrouw en als hij n van haar gedragingen niet kan uitstaan laat hem dan tevreden zijn met n van haar andere goede gedragingen
3334829 degene onder de gelovigen met het meest volledige geloof is degene met de beste gedragscode en de beste onder jullie is degene die zich het beste gedraagt tegenover zijn vrouwen
3334830 de boodschapper van allah heeft nooit ofte nimmer iets met zijn hand geslagen nog een vrouw nog een bediende
3334831 het zijn jouw vrouw en kinderen die de voorkeur genieten op jouw goede gezindheid beminnelijkheid begrip gezelligheid kalmte en glimlach
3334832 en de beste onder jullie is degene die zich het beste gedraagt tegenover zijn vrouwen
3334833 je hebt een lange tijd met me doorgebracht wat heb je geleerd
3334834 en wij hebben jou slechts gestuurd als een genade voor de werelden
3334835 de tijd voor het avond gebed is ook al voorbij
3334836 waarom ben je zo stil kom hier bij me en neem mij dat is toch hetgeen waarvoor je achter me aan kwam
3334837 doe het later ik heb toch nog veel tijd over
3334838 ik ben gezonden om de nobelste der goede manieren te vervolmaken
3334839 ik heb de neiging me in te laten met die en die ongehoorzaamheid wat moet ik daaraan doen
3334840 ik probeer s ochtends vroeg op te staan om het ochtendgebed te verrichten maar het lukt me steeds niet wat moet ik nu doen
3334841 de vervolmaking van het wereldse leven en de religie hangt af van geduld
3334842 ik zal deze ongehoorzaamheid vanaf nu laten en ik zal geduldig zij want allah swt is bij me en hij zal me bijstaan
3334843 de ziel nafs bestuurt de dienaar en leidt hem naar het paradijs of naar het hellevuur geduld is zijn teugels
3334844 o jullie die geloven zoekt hulp door middel van geduld en de salaat gebed voorwaar allah is met de geduldigen
3334845 en wij zullen jullie zeker beproeven met iets van vrees en honger en vermindering van bezittingen en levens en vruchten maar geef verheugde tijdingen aan de geduldigen
3334846 voorwaar het zijnde geduldigen die hun beloning zonder berekening zal worden gegeven
3334847 maar wie geduldig was en vergaf voorwaar dat behoort zeker tot de aanbevolen daden
3334848 ik draag een hoofddoek maar ik weet dat ik hem over een poosje af ga doen
3334849 degene die overtuigd waren dat zij allah zeker zouden ontmoeten zeiden
3334850 onze heer schenk ons geduld en maak onze voeten standvastig en sta ons bij tegen het ongelovige volk
3334851 en als er onder jullie 20 zijn die geduldig zijn dan zullen zij er 200 verslaan
3334852 oh heer sta me toe de zonnen van adam te verdrinken want ze eten van wat u ze geschonken heeft maar ze dienen iets anders dan u
3334853 oh heer sta me toe de zonen van adam in te sluiten want ze eten van wat u ze geschonken heeft maar ze dienen iets anders dan u
3334854 oh heer sta me toe om de zonen van adam in te slikken want ze eten van wat u ze geschonken heeft maar ze dienen iets anders dan u
3334855 laat ze als jullie ze geschapen hadden dan zouden jullie genade met ze hebben
3334856 voorwaar daarin zijn zeker tekenen voor iedere geduldige en dankbare
3334857 er is voor mijn allah gelovige dienaar geen andere beloning wanneer ik zijn naaste familielid bij me neem indien hij dan het oordeel aan mij overlaat dan het paradijs
3334858 o allah laat me behoren tot diegene die geduldig zijn
3334859 wanneer allah de schepselen op de dag des oordeels bijeenbrengt dan roept de oproeper
3334860 wanneer ons onrecht aan gedaan werd bleven we geduldig wanneer we slecht behandeld werden vergaven we wanneer we niet serieus genomen werden dan verdroegen we dit
3334861 ga het paradijs binnen en verheug je op de beloning voor degenen die goede daden verrichten
3334862 er overkomt de moslim niets aan nasab of wasab of hamm of pijn of verdriet zelfs de prik van een doorn of allah wist daarmee wat van zijn zonden uit
3334863 het meest beproefd zijn de profeten vervolgens de uitmuntenden en vervolgens degenen die daarop volgen in goedheid men wordt beproefd al naar gelang zijn dien wanneer zijn dien sterk is dan zal allah hem meer beproeven en wanneer er in zijn dien iets van zachtheid zit wordt hij beproefd al naar gelang zijn dien
3334864 dachten jullie dat jullie het paradijs binnen zouden gaan zonder dat allah degenen die streden van jullie gekend doet worden en de geduldigen gekend doet worden
3334865 allah zal de gelovigen niet in de toestand laten waarin jullie verkeren totdat hij het slechte van het goede scheidt en allah brengt jullie niet op de hoogte van het onwaarneembare
3334866 wanneer allah van een volk houdt dan beproeft hij het
3334867 de zoetheid van de beloning neemt bij mij de bitterheid van de pijn weg
3334868 zeven mensen zal allah in zijn schaduw laten schuilen op een dag waarop geen schaduw zal zijn buiten zijn schaduw
3334869 toen ik opsteeg naar de hemel rook ik een aangename geur die ik nooit eerder geroken had ik vroeg toen jibriel wat is dat voor een geur
3334870 dat is de geur van de kamster van de dochter van fir3awn en haar 4 kinderen
3334871 als dit de toestand is van omar met al zijn kracht en felheid wat heb ik dan nog te zeggen
3334872 o leider der gelovigen ik ben gekomen om mijn beklag te doen over mijn vrouw en haar grote mond toen ik bij je voor de deur stond hoorde ik jouw vrouw zo tekeer gaan tegen je en ik zei tegen mijzelf als dit de toestand is van omar met al zijn kracht en felheid wat heb ik dan nog te zeggen
3334873 o broeder ik verdraag het vanwege de rechten die zij op mij heeft zij bereidt mijn eten bakt mijn brood wast mijn kleren en borstvoedt mijn kind terwijl zij niet verplicht is dit allemaal te doen en zij weerhoudt mij van het begaan van haraam hiermee wordt bedoeld het neerslaan van de blik en het begaan van overspel
3334874 ik stel voor dat het leger zo en zo wordt opgesteld
3334875 zelfs jij o zoon van een zwarte vrouw komt mij verbeteren er is geen god dan allah wie ben jij
3334876 bij allah ik zal de profeet vrede zij met hem hierover informeren
3334877 heb jij niet gehoord wat aboe dharr over mij heeft gezegd
3334878 o boodschapper van allah as salaamoe caleikoem wa rahmatoellahi wa barakaatoeh
3334879 wij wisten niet of hij de profeet vrede zij met hem hem terug groette of niet
3334880 o aboe dharr heb jij hem uitgescholden vanwege het feit dat zijn moeder zwart is
3334881 o boodschapper van allah vraag vergeving voor mij vraag allah om mij te vergeven
3334882 aboe bakr is onze heer en hij heeft onze heer bilaal vrijgekocht
3334883 bij allah o bilaal ik zal mijn hoofd niet van de grond optillen totdat jij erop stampt met je voet jij bent eervol en ik ben laag
3334884 deze wang verdient het niet om met de voet gestampt te worden maar verdient het om gekust te worden
3334885 ik zag dat wij maar n hond hebben maar zij hadden er vier
3334886 wij hebben speciale lantarens in onze tuin en zij hebben de sterren in de nacht
3334887 wij hebben kleine stukjes land om op te leven en zij hebben hele velden die verder gaan dan dat wij kunnen zien
3334888 wij hebben bedienden die ons bedienen maar zij dienen anderen
3334889 wij kopen ons eten maar zij verbouwen hun eigen eten
3334890 wij hebben muren rond ons eigendom die ons beschermen zij hebben vrienden die hun beschermen
3334891 de koper en de verkoper blijven de keuze houden om van hun kooptransactie af te zien zolang zij niet uit elkaar zijn gegaan als zij zich dan eerlijk en helder opstellen zal hun kooptransactie gezegend zijn als zij daarentegen liegen en zaken verbergen zal het geen gezegende kooptransactie zijn
3334892 hij heeft jullie de godsdienst uitgelegd wat hij ervan heeft opgedragen aan noeh en hetgeen wij aan jou geopenbaard hebben en wat wij ervan aan ibraahiem en moesaa en ciesaa hebben opgedragen dat jullie de godsdienst onderhouden en dat jullie daarover niet verdeeld raken
3334893 waarlijk degenen die hun godsdienst opsplitsten en groepen werden jij o mohammed bent in niets verantwoordelijk voor hen
3334894 niemand van jullie dient het cassr gebed te verrichten behalve in banoe qoeraydhah
3334895 ashaadoe an la ila ha il a allah wa ashadou ana mohammad rasoulah allah
3334896 als iemand iets laat omwille van allah zal allah het vervangen met iets beters dan dat
3334897 als iemand zijn uiterlijke vorm op het volgen van de sunnah bouwt en zijn innerlijke vorm op aanhoudende overdenking en bewustzijn van allah hij weerhoudt zijn ziel van het volgen van verlangens hij slaat zijn blikken neer voor de verboden dingen en hij eet altijd de wettige dingen zullen zijn waarneming en inzicht nooit verkeerd zijn
3334898 als iemand zijn lage verlangens bestrijdt zal de shaytaan vluchten uit angst voor zijn schaduw
3334899 de mensen zoeken nobelheid en kracht aan de deur van de koningen en ze zullen het niet vinden behalve door de gehoorzaamheid aan allah
3334900 pues ver me hicieron la misma pregunta cuando era ni o
3334901 y usted c mo disfruta del d a a d a
3334902 no lo disfruto lo soporto he dicho que para mi existen matices la vida se apaga pero eso no significa que no exista un plan para cada vida ll mese ste destino providencia suerte dios o lo que sea creo que hay varios caminos en la vida de una persona y a partir de ah t eres libre de elegir l tuyo y seg n haces tus elecciones se abren nuevas posibilidades vamos que existe una ruta y seg n la recorres por tu camino se van formando nuevas posibilidades digamos que es como un gps cuando te sales de la ruta tiene que recalcular el camino
3334903 claro todos moriremos alg n d a el punto de partida y el punto final es lo nico que no podemos cambiar el resto es cuesti n de elecciones
3334904 entiendo tiene su l gica planteado as pero a n no me ha dicho porqu en lugar de disfrutar del d a a d a simplemente lo soporta
3334905 porque bas ndonos en todo lo que he dicho anteriormente que est aqu sentado cont ndole mi vida dos veces por semana que beba hasta perder la consciencia que sea pr cticamente mudo con la gente a la que desconozco y que me desagrade mi vida no es m s que un producto de mis propias decisiones as que a lo hecho pecho
3334906 cree que se torci todo en alg n momento exacto o que ha sido fruto de constantes decisiones
3334907 no lo s tal vez fue crecer sin padre la mega drive el d a que llegu tarde a clase por jugar al street fighter o alguna de las veces que he meado en un seto prefiero no pensarlo si te lesionas al principio de la carrera o te aguantas o te retiras y retirarse es de cobardes al menos en lo que a la vida se refiere
3334908 si no quieres saber c mo te has lesionado entonces qu haces aqui
3334909 dag mam dag pap vanaf vandaag draag ik een nikaab sluier die alleen de ogen onbedekt laat en morgen ga ik het huis uit dan ga ik trouwen met mohammed
3334910 dat gaat jou helemaal niets aan waarom wil jij dat weten
3334911 ik wil het gewoon weten mag ik alstublieft weten hoeveel u verdient per uur
3334912 als je het graag wilt weten ik verdien 7 euro per uur
3334913 moeder kan ik dan misschien alstublieft 4 euro lenen van u
3334914 als dit de reden is dat je me vroeg hoeveel ik verdien zodat je geld van me kan lenen voor een stom speeltje of iets stoms dan kun je nu meteen richting je kamer lopen om meteen naar bed te gaan en denk er goed over na hoe ego stisch je wel niet bent ik werk lang en hard elke dag opnieuw en heb geen tijd voor kinderachtige spelletjes
3334915 ik heb nagedacht en misschien ben ik toch wat hard geweest tegenover jou
3334916 het was een lange zware vermoeide dag en dat heb ik op jou afgereageerd hier heb je die 4 euro waarom je vroeg
3334917 waarom wil je meer geld als je al geld hebt
3334918 wanneer een man zijn vrouw voedt krijgt hij beloning voor deze daad en god versterkt de band tussen hen
3334919 bij de tijd voorwaar de mens lijdt zeker verlies behalve degenen die geloven en goede daden verrichten en elkaar aansporen tot de waarheid en elkaar aansporen tot geduld
3334920 door vriendelijke woorden tegen hen te spreken hen vriendelijk te behandelen en je verschijning aantrekkelijk voor hen te maken net zoals je ervan houdt dat zij dat voor jullie doen
3334921 een gelovige man moet geen afkeer hebben van zijn gelovige vrouw als hij van sommige zaken die zij doet niet houdt zal hij zeker van andere zaken wel houden
3334922 waarlijk de doenja het wereldse leven is slechts een genieting en er is geen betere genieting in de doenja dan een vrome vrouw
3334923 hij die gelooft in allah en de laatste dag moet zijn buurman niet tot last zijn en neem mijn advies aan wat betreft de goede behandeling van vrouwen want ze zijn geschapen uit een rib en het meest gebogen deel van de rib is het bovenste gedeelte als je probeert om het recht te krijgen zul je het breken en als je het met rust laat zal het gebogen blijven neem dus mijn advies aan wat betreft de goede behandeling van vrouwen
3334924 als je van haar geniet dan zal dat zijn wanneer er iets gebogens in haar blijft maar als je probeert haar recht te buigen dan breek je haar en haar breken is haar scheiden
3334925 wees vriendelijk voor de vrouwen want je hebt hen genomen door het verbond met allah en hebt het recht op seksuele omgang met hen gekregen door het woord van allah
3334926 de profeet sallallahoe aleihi wa sallem sloeg nooit zijn vrouwen of zijn slaven in feite hief hij nooit zijn hand naar iemand op behalve voor de zaak van allah of wanneer de verboden van allah werden overtreden en hij wraak nam namens allah
3334927 de slechtste positie van de mensen voor allah op de dag der opstanding is de man die gemeenschap heeft met zijn vrouw en zij met hem en daarna verspreidt hij haar geheimen
3334928 o boodschapper van allah wat zijn de rechten van de vrouw van n van ons op haar echtgenoot
3334929 je moet haar te eten geven wanneer je zelf eet haar kleden wanneer je jezelf kleedt haar niet in haar gezicht slaan en haar niet uitschelden of alleen laten behalve in het huis
3334930 niemand van jullie mag zijn vrouw slaan zoals een slaaf wordt geslagen en dan aan het eind van de dag gemeenschap met haar hebben
3334931 van de zaken die toegestaan halaal zijn is de echtscheiding het meest gehaat door allah
3334932 het verspillen van het levensonderhoud van degenen die van hem afhankelijk zijn is genoeg zonde voor een man
3334933 wanneer een man wiens dien jou tevreden stelt naar je toe komt en je vraagt om je dochter te mogen trouwen laat haar dan met hem trouwen anders zal corruptie zich over de aarde verspreiden
3334934 rasoelallah sallallahoe aleihi wa sallem verdeelde zijn bezoeken aan zijn vrouwen op rechtvaardige wijze en zei
3334935 o mijn neef rasoelallah sallallahoe aleihi wa sallem gaf niet aan n van ons de voorkeur boven de anderen wat betreft de tijd die hij met ons doorbracht het kwam zelden voor dat hij ons niet allemaal bezocht en zijn vrouwen benaderde zonder gemeenschap met ze te hebben totdat hij tenslotte de vrouw bezocht wiens dag het was en de nacht met haar doorbracht
3334936 eenieder die twee vrouwen heeft en ze niet rechtvaardig behandelt zal op de dag der opstanding verschijnen terwijl hij een deel van zijn lichaam dat naar beneden hangt met zich mee sleept
3334937 een man is raa in leider verantwoordelijke over zijn familie en is verantwoordelijk voor zijn leiderschap
3334938 de besten onder jullie zijn degenen die het beste voor hun vrouwen zijn
3334939 zal ik jullie vertellen wie de besten onder jullie zijn de vriendelijke man en degene met een goed karakter die zijn vrouw eervol behandelt wanneer hij ertoe in staat is
3334940 de meest geliefde aanbiddende dienaar is voor allah degene die het beste is voor zijn familie
3334941 er is niemand van jullie die drie dochters of zusters heeft en goed voor hen is zonder dat hij het paradijs binnengaat
3334942 de slechtste man is degene die zijn familie depressief maakt
3334943 wanneer de man zijn huis binnengaat wordt zijn vrouw nederig rent zijn kind weg en verstopt zijn bediende zich maar wanneer hij zijn huis verlaat lacht zijn vrouw en zijn familie wordt vrolijk en komt tezamen
3334944 waarlijk ik haat de man die kwaad is en die over zijn vrouw neergebogen staat met zijn slagaderen opgezwollen terwijl hij haar slaat
3334945 o jullie die geloven vreest allah en spreekt het ware woord hij zal jullie goede daden aanvaarden en jullie je zonden vergeven en wie allah en zijn boodschapper gehoorzaamt waarlijk die heeft een geweldige triomf behaald
3334946 o jullie die geloven vermijdt de meest kwade vermoedens voorwaar een deel van de kwade vermoedens zijn zonden en bespioneert elkaar niet en spreekt geen kwaad over elkaar in elkaars afwezigheid zou iemand van jullie het vlees van zijn dode broeder willen eten jullie zouden het zeker haten en vreest allah voorwaar allah is berouwaanvaardend meest barmhartig
3334947 en voorzeker wij hebben de mens geschapen en wij weten wat zijn ziel hem influistert en wij zijn dichter bij hem dan zijn halsslagader wanneer de twee ontvangers engelen aan de rechterzijde en aan de linkerzijde zitten te schrijven is er geen woord dat hij uit of aan zijn zijde bevindt zich een waker die gereed is
3334948 en degenen die de gelovige mannen en de gelovige vrouwen kwetsen zonder dat zij iets slechts hebben verricht voorzeker zij hebben laster en een duidelijke zonde op zich geladen
3334949 het is dat je iets over je broeder zegt wat hem niet bevalt
3334950 stel dat het waar is wat ik over mijn broeder gezegd heb
3334951 als het waar is wat je gezegd hebt dan heb je over hem geroddeld en als het niet waar is dan heb je hem belasterd
3334952 en volg niet dat waarover je geen kennis hebt voorwaar het gehoor en het gezichtsvermogen en de harten die zullen allen erover ondervraagd worden
3334953 waarlijk allah houdt van drie dingen voor jullie en hij verwerpt drie dingen voor jullie hij is tevreden met jullie dat jullie hem aanbidden en niets met hem vereenzelvigen in aanbidding en dat jullie je allemaal tezamen vasthouden aan het koord van allah en niet uiteenvallen en hij verwerpt voor jullie qiela wa qaala wat er gezegd is en wat hij zei m a w onzinnige praat voortdurend vragen stellen en het verspillen van geld
3334954 voor het nageslacht van adam is zijn onvermijdelijke aandeel van ontucht en er is geen ontkomen aan de ontucht van het oog is de wellustige blik en de ontucht van de oren is het luisteren naar wellustig gezang of gepraat en de ontucht van de tong is losbandige spraak en de ontucht van de hand is de wellustige greep omhelzing en de ontucht van de benen is de wandeling naar de plaats waar hij ontucht wil begaan en het hart smacht en verlangt naar ontucht en de geslachtsdelen zetten dat om in werkelijkheid of weerhouden zich van het overgeven aan de verleiding
3334955 een moslim is iemand die het vermijdt om moslims met zijn tong en handen te schaden
3334956 een man vroeg aan de boodschapper van allah sallallahu alayhi wa salaam wie onder de moslims is beter
3334957 deze hadith is algemeen wat de tong betreft maar minder algemeen wat de hand betreft dat is omdat het voor de tong mogelijk is om te spreken over wat er in het verleden met mensen gebeurd is wat er in het heden met hen gebeurt en wat er in de toekomst met hen zou kunnen gebeuren de hand kan dit echter niet maar is wel in staat om hierin samen te werken met de tong door te schrijven wat grote consequenties kan hebben
3334958 degene die de eerbaarheid kan garanderen van datgene wat zich tussen zijn twee kaakbeenderen bevindt m a w zijn tong en datgene wat zich tussen zijn twee benen bevindt m a w zijn geslachtsdeel ik garandeer het paradijs voor hem
3334959 laat degene die in allah en de laatste dag gelooft het goede zeggen of zwijgen
3334960 zei de betekenis van deze hadith is wanneer iemand wil spreken moet hij eerst nadenken
3334961 als jullie allemaal een vel papier zouden kopen om alles wat je gezegd hebt te noteren dan zijn er veel dingen die jullie niet gezegd zouden hebben
3334962 het is voor elk intelligent persoon verplicht om te allen tijde te zwijgen totdat het nodig is voor hem om te spreken want hoe vaak heeft iemand spijt van wat hij gezegd heeft nadat hij het gezegd heeft en hoe zelden heeft iemand spijt van wat hij gezegd heeft als hij gezwegen heeft en de mensen die het langst ongelukkig blijven en de meeste beproevingen doormaken zijn degenen die getroffen zijn met een losse tong en een hard hart
3334963 het is voor de intelligente persoon verplicht om zijn oren twee keer zo vaak te gebruiken als zijn tong en zich te realiseren dat hij twee oren gekregen heeft en slechts n mond zodat hij meer gaat luisteren dan hij spreekt dat is omdat hij spijt zou kunnen krijgen van wat hij gezegd heeft wanneer hij spreekt maar als hij zwijgt dan zal hij niets hebben om spijt van te hebben het is immers gemakkelijker om terug te nemen wat je nooit gezegd hebt maar zodra een woord uitgesproken is bezit het zijn spreker maar als het nooit uitgesproken is blijft dit het eigendom van degene die het nooit uitgesproken heeft
3334964 de tong van de intelligente persoon schuilt achter zijn hart zodat hij zijn hart raadpleegt wanneer hij iets wil zeggen als er gedacht wordt dat hij zou moeten spreken dan doet hij dat maar zo niet dan zwijgt hij bij de onwetende persoon bevindt het hart zich echter op het puntje van zijn tong dus spreekt hij zonder na te denken en degene die zijn tong niet bewaakt begrijpt zijn religie islam niet
3334965 waarlijk een dienaar kan een woord spreken zonder zich te bedenken of het goed of slecht is en kan daardoor verder in het hellevuur vallen dan de afstand tussen het oosten en het westen
3334966 worden mensen op hun gezichten of op hun neuzen het hellevuur ingeworpen om iets anders dan wat hun tongen geoogst hebben
3334967 o profeet van allah worden we verantwoordelijk gehouden voor wat we ermee zeggen m a w met onze tongen
3334968 de betekenis van wat hun tongen geoogst hebben is vergelding en bestraffing voor verboden spraak waarlijk de mensheid zaait met zowel zijn goede als zijn slechte spraak en daden en op de dag des oordeels oogst hij wat hij gezaaid heeft degene die goede spraak en daden gezaaid heeft zal een goede en royale oogst vergaren maar degene die slechte spraak en daden gezaaid heeft zal een oogst van spijt vergaren
3334969 deze hadith is het bewijs dat het bedwingen van de tong en het scherp onder controle houden ervan de basis is voor al het goede en degene die zijn tong onder controle houdt heeft controle over zijn zaak
3334970 ik heb nooit iemand gezien die behoedzaam was voor zijn tong zonder dat het een goed effect had op de rest van zijn daden en handelingen
3334971 ik heb nooit gezien dat de spraak van iemand goed was zonder dat ik ook zag dat de rest van zijn daden en handelingen goed was en ik heb nooit gezien dat de spraak van iemand slechts was zonder dat ik ook zag dat de rest van zijn daden en handelingen slecht was
3334972 degene die failliet is is degene die geen geld of voorzieningen heeft
3334973 degene die failliet is van mijn ummah is degene die op de dag des oordeels komt terwijl hij het gebed verricht heeft gevast heeft en zakaat gegeven heeft maar naast dit alles heeft hij deze persoon mishandeld en die persoon belasterd en de rijkdom van die persoon verorberd onwettig het bloed van die persoon vergoten en die persoon geslagen deze mensen zullen van zijn goede daden nemen als zijn goede daden echter uitgeput zijn dan zullen hun zonden op hem geplaatst worden en dan zal hij in het vuur gegooid worden
3334974 het is al voldoende als ernstig kwaad dat een moslim zijn moslimbroeder veracht alle zaken van een moslim zijn onschendbaar voor een andere moslim zijn bloed zijn rijkdom en zijn eer
3334975 de boodschapper van allah sallallahu alayhi wa salaam sprak de mensen toe op de dag van nahr de 10de dag van dhul hijjah en zei o mensen
3334976 bij hem in wiens hand mijn ziel rust dit was de wasiyyah wilsbeschikking van de profeet die hij voor zijn natie achterliet het is verplicht voor de aanwezigen om deze informatie over te dragen aan degenen die afwezig zijn keer na mij niet terug tot ongeloof elkaar naar de nekken vliegend
3334977 voor degene die mensen opgeroepen heeft tot de juiste leiding wordt een beloning verzekerd gelijk aan de beloningen van degenen die de leiding gevolgd hebben zonder dat hun beloningen op enige manier verminderd worden en degene die mensen opgeroepen heeft tot misleiding krijgt de zonden over zich van degenen die het gevolgd hebben zonder dat hun zonden op enige manier verminderd worden
3334978 wanneer een persoon overlijdt komen zijn daden ten einden behalve drie doorlopend liefdadigheidswerk profijtvolle kennis en een rechtschapen kind dat smeekbeden tot allah verricht voor hem de overledene
3334979 deze hadith en andere soortgelijke ahadith bewijzen dat degene die profijtvolle kennis opschrijft hiervoor een beloning ontvangt na zijn dood evenals een beloning voor iedere persoon die het leest of het kopieert of eruit citeert of ermee in overeenstemming handelt voor zolang als zijn geschriften blijven bestaan en de mensen ermee in overeenstemming blijven handelen
3334980 ik zal de oorloge verklaren aan degene die vijandigheid toont tegenover een vrome aanbidder van mij
3334981 ik vergezelde de profeet sallallahu alayhi wa salaam op een reis op een dag was ik vlakbij hem terwijl we aan het reizen waren en ik zei tegen hem vertel me iets wat ik kan doen waardoor ik het paradijs zal binnengaan en wat me ver van het hellevuur houdt
3334982 het lezen van de koran zette mij aan het denken het boek heeft heel veel gelijkenissen met de bijbel
3334983 op 21 januari 2003 ben ik moslim geworden daaraan is een lang proces vooraf gegaan als je als westerling in de arabische wereld en met name in een streng moslimland als qatar wordt neergezet word je ineens ondergedompeld in de moslimcultuur sinds februari 2001 ben ik werkzaam als general manager van de campus van de christelijke hogeschool nederland chn in doha in qatar de gang naar het midden oosten was geen logische het zou nooit mijn eerste keuze zijn geweest de ontelbare moskee n daar de vijf gebeden per dag de oproep van de moskee n tot gebed dat kun je niet ontlopen het overkomt je en het is indrukwekkend om de massaliteit van dit geloof aan den lijve te ondervinden doordat de doha campus zon kleine gemeenschap is ben je als nagenoeg enige westerling automatisch erg betrokken bij je arabische collegas en studenten de band is sterk en vriendschappelijk ze nodigen je regelmatig uit en je maakt kennis met de normen waarden en rituelen van de arabische wereld maar je mag het alleen vanaf een afstand meemaken want je bent geen moslim het betreden van een moskee bijvoorbeeld is niet toegestaan het bijwonen van de gebeden al helemaal niet tijdens de ramadan de vastenmaand in 2002 ben ik door een bevriende egyptische familie meer betrokken bij de rituelen de vader heeft mij in wekelijkse ontmoetingen veel verteld over de islam en mij voorgesteld aan zijn imam ik heb een engels arabische versie van de koran ontvangen en ben die gaan lezen ik ontdekte dat het boek veel gelijkenissen heeft met de bijbel allah is dezelfde god als de god van de christenen de eerste profeet door god benoemd was mozes zowel voor christenen als islamieten de koran kent ook jezus al gelooft zij niet dat jezus de zoon van god is dat is een moeilijk punt bij de overstap van christen naar moslim na een leven als goed moslim komt je in het paradijs te vergelijken met de hemel van de bijbel broederschap het lezen van de koran zette me aan het denken omdat in de westerse wereld dit boek zo anders wordt afgeschilderd voor het eerst heb ik bijvoorbeeld kennis genomen van het begrip jihad ik heb tot mijn geruststelling kunnen vaststellen dat dit in oorsprong niet zo bedoeld is als het door fundamentalistische groeperingen wordt uitgelegd en toegepast
3334984 de gehele ervaring had me een zeer waardevolle les onderwezen en dat wij geen propaganda moeten geloven die de machtige mensen op hoge plaatsen ons willen laten geloven zegt ridley
3334985 en mijn vriendinnen kunnen dit zien en vragen aan mij waardoor ik zo ben veranderd
3334986 was ik neergeschoten of gedood zou dit gehelpt hebben het bombarderen van afghanistan te rechtvaardigen
3334987 neem dit niet persoonlijk op het was niet tegen jou
3334988 wat bijzonder mooi is het als ik succesvol ben dan zou ik de eerste vrouwelijke moslimpoliticus worden in westminster en waarschijnlijk de eerste vrouw te zitten die een hijab draagt om in de huizen van het parlement te zitten
3334989 der auftrag ist klar formuliert 25 prozent plus eine aktie in sterreichischer hand
3334990 nehmen wir die gespr che ber weitere verbesserungen f r die familien gleich auf
3334991 beschlie en wir doch das wor ber einigkeit besteht so rasch wie m glich
3334992 und reden wir gleichzeitig weiter ber die n chsten schritte zur entlastung der familien
3334993 alle familien unabh ngig vom alter der kinder sollen von dieser erh hung profitieren
3334994 ich erinnere mich an eine riesige porzellangruppe aus meissner porzellan die ein sehr hoher funktion r als geschenk erhalten haben soll ich habe sie selbst gesehen einer der h chsten polizisten bekam f r seine frau ein collier berreicht
3334995 reisen nach gro britannien geschenkt bekam die er mit seiner familie antrat sie wurden als bildungsreisen bezeichnet
3334996 meine vertraulichen ermittlungen wurden den vertretern der casinos austria ag berreicht mir wurde zu verstehen gegeben dass meine kleinkariertheit im sinne der weitergabe von daten nicht im interesse der casino ag und der f hrung der polizeidirektion wien ist
3334997 ich fand meinen eigenen akt im original bei einer hausdurchsuchung bei einem fp politiker
3334998 haben uns aus der hand gefressen ich wei das aus pers nlicher erfahrung
3334999 ich habe die drecksarbeit geleistet nun f hle ich mich betrogen und belogen
3335000 er kontaktierte mich weil er seiner erinnerung nach ein haltezeichen eines polizeibeamten geglaubt hat berfahren zu haben
3335001 ich habe mich weder privat noch dienstlich im rotlicht bewegt ein grund f r diese falschen berichte besteht darin dass ich den boulevard nicht mehr so bedienen kann wie fr her und wie es mein auftrag war
3335002 nach meiner wahrnehmung existiert hier ein tiefer sumpf wie am balkan und wien ist seine hauptstadt
3335003 das justizministerium hat unter einbindung aller betroffenen ressorts einen gesetzesentwurf erarbeitet der den schutz vor gewalt insbesondere bei kindern verbessert wichtige verbesserungen im opferschutz wie der ausbau der einstweiligen verf gung der neue tatbestand gegen lang andauernde gewaltbeziehungen im h uslichen bereich und die gerichtliche kontrolle von sexualstraft tern inklusive eines berufs und t tigkeitsverbotes sind darin enthalten der heutige auftrag des ministerrates zu weiteren verhandlungen stimmt mich optimistisch dass wir noch vor den neuwahlen ein paket f r mehr opferschutz in sterreich schn ren k nnen das dann auch den vom innenministerium bisher nicht vorgelegten entwurf f r die sexualstraft terdatei beinhaltet
3335004 der last minute markt hat auch in zeiten teuren treibstoffs seine eigenen regeln

3335006 m chtegern sozialrevolution r buchinger darf noch einmal jubeln die v llig unzureichende pflegel sung light ist durch den ministerrat gegangen
3335007 dies ist meines erachtens ganz einfach der ausdruck einer pseudo sozialen politik die sich in erster linie an den bed rfnissen der sp wahlkampagne orientiert
3335008 zuerst hat man eine pflegel sung mit amnestieregelungen verschleppt dann gingen die betroffenen beim gegenseitigen tauziehen zwischen sp und vp unter was am schluss herauskam ist nun eine scheinl sung die es dem pflegechaosduo buchinger bartenstein erlauben soll den kopf aus der schlinge zu ziehen
3335009 wo bleibt bei diesem omin sen pflegepaket die ausbildungsoffensive f r inl ndische pflegekr fte die f r die zukunft dringend notwendig w re
3335010 der rot schwarze regierungskompromiss ist kurzsichtig und unfair nur eine rasche und ehrliche vollprivatisierung also ein strategischer partner kann die probleme der aua l sen
3335011 der deal ist reine augenauswischerei anstatt vollst ndig zu privatisieren wird die iag auf die suche nach einem kernaktion r geschickt das w rde aber nur sinn machen wenn man ber die b rse privatisiert und streubesitz vorhanden ist die von der regierung ausgehandelten bedingungen bedeuten f r ernsthafte interessenten und f r das wohl der aua gravierende nachteile
3335012 das drehkreuz wien und die damit verbundenen arbeitspl tze kann man durch entsprechende vertr ge sichern
3335013 die vergangenheit hat gezeigt dass die iag kein guter strategischer partner ist vielmehr ist sie durch verschwendete ressourcen und falsche management entscheidungen f r die jetzige krise der aua verantwortlich
3335014 so muss sich die n chste regierung erst recht mit dem jetzt scheinbar gel sten problem herumschlagen und die rot schwarzen vers umnisse ausbaden dabei g be es noch weit dringlichere probleme anzupacken

3335017 das engagement f r unsere mitb rgerinnen und mitb rger im ausland ist einer der schwerpunkte unserer arbeit in rund 115 000 f llen leisteten wir sterreicherinnen und sterreichern konsularische hilfe was einer steigerung von etwa 17 prozent gegen ber dem vorjahr entspricht das neue portal www aoe ratgeber at der ratgeber f r auslands sterreicherinnen und auslands sterreicher vereinfacht den kontakt der rund 150 000 sterreicher in der welt mit ihrer heimat mit der wahlrechtsreform die uns ein besonderes anliegen war ist die stimmabgabe im ausland bedeutend einfacher und b rgern her geworden
3335018 das jahr 2007 hat uns im prozess der wiedervereinigung europas bedeutende schritte weiter gebracht
3335019 der beitritt rum niens und bulgariens zur europ ischen union die einf hrung des euro in slowenien und die erweiterung des schengen raums gibt uns die m glichkeit als europ erinnen und europ er noch enger zusammenzur cken und den austausch politisch menschlich kulturell und wirtschaftlich zu intensivieren
3335020 die mit montenegro sowie mit bosnien und herzegowina abgeschlossenen stabilisierungs und assoziierungsabkommen f hren diese l nder des balkans entscheidend n her an europa heran die mit albanien bosnien und herzegowina mazedonien montenegro und serbien unterzeichneten visaerleichterungs und r ck bernahmeabkommen schaffen vereinfachte reisem glichkeiten f r ausgew hlte personengruppen wir wollen damit vor allem den jungen menschen in der region das gef hl der isolation nehmen und ihnen die m glichkeit geben europa aus erster hand kennen zu lernen
3335021 ber die verhandlungen f r den vertrag von lissabon der die europ ische union demokratischer moderner und handlungsf higer macht haben wir laufend informiert
3335022 der direkte kontakt mit unseren mitb rgerinnen und mitb rgern ist mir ein besonderes anliegen die seit dem herbst regelm ig stattfindenden schulbesuche und die tage der offenen t r zeigen das interesse der b rger das ministerium und seine mitarbeiterinnen und mitarbeiter kennen zu lernen und sich ber unsere arbeit zu informieren
3335023 rund 1 300 sterreicherinnen und sterreicher waren 2007 im rahmen von friedenseins tzen der europ ischen union und der vereinten nationen aktiv f r dieses engagement genie t sterreich international hohe wertsch tzung und anerkennung mit unserer kandidatur f r einen nichtst ndigen sitz im uno sicherheitsrat m chten wir diesen weg fortsetzen
3335024 unsere verst rkte aufmerksamkeit haben wir insbesondere den themen armutsbek mpfung l ndliche entwicklung klimaschutz und bildung unter besonderer ber cksichtigung der menschenrechte und des schutzes und der f rderung der rechte von frauen und kindern geschenkt
3335025 sterreich in der welt sichtbar zu machen ist ziel der auslandskulturpolitik
3335026 die er ffnung von sterreich bibliotheken in istanbul und in jekaterinburg sowie eines kulturforums in new delhi schafft neue anlaufstellen f r die an unserem land interessierten hilft unsere sprache besser kennen zu lernen und erm glicht das entdecken der vielschichtigen sterreichischen kultur
3335027 im letzten jahr konnten wir auch wien als ort des dialogs st rken mit einer regen konferenzaktivit t wie den gespr chen zum atomkonflikt mit dem iran den kosovo statusverhandlungen oder der wiener streumunitionskonferenz konnten wir friedensbem hungen unterst tzen und wichtige impulse setzen mit der er ffnung der neuen eu grundrechteagentur und des st ndigen osze amtssitzes unterstreichen wir unsere tatkr ftige unterst tzung f r regionale sicherheitsorganisationen als einziger uno sitz in der eu wollen wir wien als knotenpunkt eines immer engmaschigeren netzwerks von verbindungslinien zwischen der eu und internationalen organisationen etablieren
3335028 das erste halbjahr 2008 entspricht unseren erwartungen es war aber nicht zufrieden stellend
3335029 unsere tochter affilinet konnte den umsatz deutlich steigern w hrend adlink media nur eine leichte steigerung gegen ber dem vorjahr zeigt im domain marketing sedo blieb der umsatz erwartungsgem auch im zweiten quartal hinter dem vorjahr zur ck sedo ist nach wie vor von negativen effekten betroffen die bereits im ersten quartal 2008 berichtet wurden dabei handelt es sich um dauerhafte nderungen bei policy und algorithmen die unsere wichtigsten partner im suchmaschinen bereich vorgenommen haben au erdem schl gt sich die anhaltende schw che des dollar und des britischen pfundes in den zahlen nieder
3335030 die bedeutung der online werbung wird weiter zunehmen auch wenn sie nicht unbeeinflusst von konjunkturellen schwankungen bleibt
3335031 vor diesem hintergrund st rken wir unsere weniger konjunkturabh ngigen performancemarketing l sungen und setzen verst rkt neue technologien zur optimierung der prozesseffizienz ein f r den weiteren verlauf des gesch ftsjahres sind wir zuversichtlich und best tigen unsere mai prognose f r 2008 wir erwarten ein umsatzwachstum von 10 im konzern und ein vorsteuerergebnis in etwa auf dem niveau des vorjahres ohne sondereffekte d h von rund 21 mio eur
3335032 um die inflationsbedingten realen verluste beim pflegegeld nur auszugleichen ist eine erh hung von 10 prozent das mindeste
3335033 pflege muss leistbar qualit tsvoll und sicher sein rund 80 prozent der pflegebed rftigen menschen in ganz sterreich werden nach wie vor zu hause betreut und gepflegt damit aber die pflegebed rftigen menschen trotz vielf ltiger einschr nkungen ein relativ selbstst ndiges leben im eigenen haushalt f hren k nnen muss das pflegegeld entsprechend angehoben werden es muss daher eine einmalige erh hung des pflegegeldes um 10 prozent verbunden mit einer dauerhaften valorisierung umgehend durchgef hrt werden
3335034 jeder sterreicher hat das recht auf sichere und leistbare pflege auch ein pflegebed rftiger der zwar keine 24 stunden betreuung ben tigt hat reale kaufkraftverluste erlitten und ist auf hilfe angewiesen hier zwischen pflegebed rftigen zu differenzieren ist unsozial und ungerecht
3335035 the first six months of 2008 were in line with expectations but not satisfactory
3335036 our subsidiary affilinet achieved strong sales growth while sales of adlink media were only slightly up on the prior year figure as expected sales in our domain marketing segment sedo were down on the previous year also in the second quarter sedo continues to suffer from negative effects which were already reported in the first quarter of 2008 these effects result from permanent changes in policy and algorithms which our most important partners in the search engine business have made the continuing weakness of the us dollar and the uk pound is also reflected in these figures
3335037 the importance of online advertising will continue to grow although it is not free of influence from economic fluctuations
3335038 against this backdrop we will strengthen our performance marketing solutions which are less dependent on general economic factors and will focus increasingly on new technologies to optimize process efficiency

3335049 maar degenen die geloven houden meer van allah dan al het andere soerat al baqarah vers 165 ook hoort een gelovige meer van de boodschapper mohammed allahs vrede en zegen zij met hem te houden dan al het andere dan zal diegene een ware gelovige zijn anas verhaalde dat de profeet allahs vrede en zegen zij met hem zei niemand van jullie heeft ware geloof totdat hij meer van mij houdt dan zijn vader zijn kind en de gehele mensheid
3335050 allah is de wali beschermer en helper van de gelovigen
3335051 en degene die taqwa vrees voor allah heeft en zijn plicht aan hem nakomt hij zal een weg voor hem maken om eruit te komen uit elke moeilijkheid
3335052 en degene die omwille van ons streven die zullen wij zeker leiding schenken op onze wegen en voorwaar allah is zeker met de weldoeners
3335053 zeg tegen de gelovige vrouwen dat zij hun sluiers over hun boezems moeten dragen
3335054 en degene die taqwa vrees voor allah heeft en zijn plicht aan hem nakomt hij zal een weg voor hem maken om eruit te komen uit elke moeilijkheid

3335057 tiffanys decision to carry this litigation on after the district courts decision doesnt do anything to combat counterfeiting

3335064 i remember being nervous and closing my eyes and thinking how did i get myself into this
3335065 i eased my way into it and it sounded very nice practice pays off after all i then remember wanting to open my eyes and be sure that there were still people there because it was absolute dead silence for almost 3 minutes it seemed like the entire audience of 1200 people had vanished that is the brilliant thing about these guys culture clash they can control their crowds with waves of emotion one second they have everyone dying of laughter and the next they have everyone in tears
3335066 augmented reality projects have most recently focused on war games but a new lab at the mawson institute for advanced manufacturing will bring this tech closer to home
3335067 every time you introduce a new technology we have to figure out how it fits into the existing technological structure
3335068 fighting traffic the dawn of the motor age in the american city
3335069 we have this new thing called texting and this old thing called the street and were trying to figure out how theyre going to mix
3335070 maybe one day when a solution is found well think that it was natural and obvious from day one but its not now natural and obvious
3335071 well probably never know how big the problem of reading while crossing the street was
3335072 but it was certainly an issue that was being talked about
3335073 i have news articles of women beating police with parasols for having been ticketed for crossing in the middle of a street
3335074 before you have a law enforcement crackdown you have to have people discredit the practice
3335075 but it succeeded in the sense that everybody learned what jaywalking was by 1924 less than 10 years after the word had been used to describe the practice it was in an american english dictionary
3335076 when reckless driving was a new concept aaa had a contest to come up with a word for reckless driver
3335077 given what theyve done with what they have its astonishing
3335078 i think one of the great things about this band is that everyone wants to be there
3335079 nobody has to be there if someone doesnt want to be there they can just leave
3335080 added greatly to the general spirit of excitement by its presence
3335081 never once have i been able to draw up something on a chalkboard
3335082 were gypsies we have to beg and borrow space all the time
3335083 i was hooked from the beginning it was the excitement of starting something new and it would definitely make an impact on the university
3335084 i always say we started the band with four or five people
3335085 the instrumentation probably worried me the most getting the right instruments to play in that big a venue to put out that kind of a sound to fill it out
3335086 were entertaining for 60 000 people if were not intense its not going to be fun for those people
3335087 the students are really making the band their own and contributing and making decisions
3335088 that to a person is the most memorable day in their lives
3335089 i was just thinking please dont trip please dont drop the baton
3335090 i knew i wanted to be in the u va band whatever form it happened to be in
3335091 it would be ridiculous to put down an organization that supported the school for that amount of time
3335092 my experience with the marching band was nothing short of phenomenal joining it was surely one of the best decisions i made while at u va
3335093 theres some sort of immediate camaraderie that forms among bandies
3335094 there was something about those students that made me believe that this was going to work
3335095 we were very lucky that the students we had initially did a super job without really having any reference
3335096 everything that the band has done under bills direction has been professionally presented
3335097 the way they look and the way they sound speaks to a high level of professionalism
3335098 i know im boring you but this is how you get to the next level
3335099 sometimes i think of him as an older version of myself
3335100 voi sapete perch si grida contro unaltra persona quando si arrabbiati il fatto che quando due persone sono arrabbiate i loro cuori si allontanano molto per coprire questa distanza bisogna gridare per potersi ascoltare quanto pi arrabbiati sono tanto pi forte dovranno gridare per sentirsi luno con laltro daltra parte che succede quando due persone sono innamorate loro non gridano parlano soavemente e perch perch i loro cuori sono molto vicini la distanza tra loro piccola e quando lamore pi intenso non necessario nemmeno sussurrare basta guardarsi i loro cuori si intendono e questo che accade quando due persone che si amano si avvicinano

3335145 it was 6 1 percent of the girls who answered that they had had sex with someone of the same gender while 1 7 percent of boys said the same thing
3335146 it may be that girls feel their way forward without identifying themselves as either homo or heterosexual
3335147 there is less of a taboo for girls during their teenage years girls are often a bit more intimate with each other in their own way boys are often more worried afraid to diverge and the expressed norm is to not be homosexual
3335148 its possible that girls who know they are oriented toward homosexuality have become sexually active earlier than boys
3335149 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3335150 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3335151 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3335152 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3335153 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3335154 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3335155 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3335156 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3335157 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3335158 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3335159 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3335160 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3335161 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3335162 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3335163 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3335164 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3335165 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3335166 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3335167 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3335168 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3335169 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3335170 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3335171 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3335172 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3335173 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3335174 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3335175 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3335176 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3335177 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3335178 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3335179 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3335180 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3335181 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3335182 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3335183 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3335184 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3335185 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3335186 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3335187 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3335188 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3335189 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3335190 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3335191 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3335192 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3335193 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3335194 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3335195 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3335196 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3335197 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3335198 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3335199 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3335200 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3335201 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3335202 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3335203 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3335204 who are open to doing something on the production side
3335205 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3335206 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3335207 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3335208 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3335209 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3335210 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3335211 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3335212 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3335213 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3335214 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3335215 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3335216 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3335217 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3335218 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3335219 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3335220 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3335221 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3335222 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3335223 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3335224 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3335225 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3335226 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3335227 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

3335273 no matter how this conflict started russia has escalated it well beyond the dispute over south ossetia and invaded another country
3335274 russia has escalated its military campaign through strategic bombing and the movement of its ground forces into the heart of georgia there is no possible justification for these attacks
3335275 let me be clear we seek a future of cooperative engagement with the russian government and friendship with the russian people
3335276 we want russia to play its rightful role as a great nation but with that role comes the responsibility to act as a force for progress in this new century not regression to the conflicts of the past
3335277 russian president medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the u s and europe

3335291 we are citizens of an age as well as of a state and if it is held to be unseemly or even inadmissible for a man to cut himself off from the customs and manners of the circle in which he lives why should it be less of a duty in the choice of his activity to submit his decision to the needs and the taste of his century

3335294 it was like going back to the 70s saying she was asking for it how else could you read the letter but as saying its my fault i was raped
3335295 it was just so cruel and unthinking and so wrong because there is nothing you can do to prevent yourself being raped it is not illegal to go out and have a drink it is illegal to rape somebody
3335296 its appalling the number of women that are probably getting this letter and arent fighting because they dont know that they can
3335297 it was immoral my immediate reaction was there has got to be some way to fight this
3335298 cicas policy is not to make a reduction on a claim for compensation following rape on the basis of alcohol consumption
3335299 the scheme was originally applied wrongly in this case but this was corrected at review and the award was paid in full
3335300 it is never an individuals fault if he she gets raped regardless of how much he she has drunk

3335323 having the extra money alleviates some of the stress of being able to afford college im worried that my rent keeps going up and i feel like this gives me a cushion i dont have a car so i dont need gas money but i really need it for rent money

3335329 we can discuss the question of a definitive settlement if two conditions are met

3335367 but the republicans and the president have resisted instead they have this thing that says drill offshore in the protected areas well we can do that we can have a vote on that but it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public and not just a hoax on them
3335368 it depends how the drilling is put forth but i dont that is not excluded let me say it that way it depends how that is proposed if the safeguards are there
3335369 you dont know who knows how does he know that
3335370 what we have learned about what happened in iowa was that it was a very strong anti war vote barack obama never supported the war edwards backed away from his vote on the war and that was a differentiating issue in that campaign i dont know who would have benefited it probably would have been spread around some of the other candidates for president may think that they would have benefited as the alternative to hillary clinton and to barack obama maybe somebody else would have run if he were not in the race nobody can tell you what would have happened

3335411 adrian wong is one of the few really devoted scholars in the field of computer hardware he applies a rare scientific rigorousness to his work that makes it stand out among the usual stuff on the net he is a real asset to the pc enthusiast
3335412 the bios optimization guide is a one of a kind resource that i refer to anybody who wants to tweak their computers to run the best and i wouldnt refer others to something i wouldnt use myself ive referred to the bog countless times as i upgrade my bios or get a new motherboard the in depth explanations really let you know what each bios option means and which settings these options yield the highest performance and stability
3335413 adrian knows more about tweaking a bios than bill gates knows about windows short and sweet if you own a computer you need to know about the bios and adrian is flat out the authority when it comes to understanding configuring or tweaking a computers bios
3335414 if you ever wanted to know what you can do with your bios adrian has it covered being an admirer for more years than i can count the bios optimization guide is a fantastic journey into the inner workings of a pc at the root level it has taught me how to tweak my pc in a safe way and get the most out of my system period
3335415 it is the one piece of the system that is powered continually
3335416 the bios optimization guide is a truly useful resource for those looking to get the most out of their systems i often point people to the bog to learn more about memory timings and what they mean
3335417 95 of all bios optimizations that i now know i learned from rojak pots guide and so did everyone else if they tell you different they are not telling the you the truth or they read it on a site that stole the information from his
3335418 whether you are an overclocking uber geek or a first time computer user adrians bios optimization guide is a must i can truthfully say that 90 of what i have learned about bios optimization has been through the use of adrians guide why else would i refer to him as the king of the bios
3335419 adrian has done the tech community a great service by making this guide it has personally saved me time on both repairs and evaluations with bios options as numerous as they are today its wonderful to have a one stop source to decipher them all
3335420 you know i couldnt count the amount of times ive referred people to your bios guideelits very informative and saves me the time of explaining why people should disable video bios shadowing why fast writes isnt such a big deal for todays games and much more
3335421 just wanted to say thanks for saving me time and also helping me out i learned a lot from it too keep up the most excellent work
3335422 this isnt so much a knowledge base but a labor of love not only has this guide had a place in both titchs and my favorites for many years but im really excited to see it still going after many many years well done adrian keep up the excellent work
3335423 adrian wong of adrians rojak pot has been building up his bios guide since late 1999
3335424 this is one of the most comprehensive and user friendly guides i have found to date i was able to do various tweaks with my mem cpu that increased my overall system performance by about 15 many of the bios tweaks will depend on your mobo and whether certain options are even available in your bios menu however i do recommend that even ppl that arent familiar with working with the bios give it a go with this guide really helps to answer all your questions
3335425 some bookmarks occupy space in my favorites folder just in case i need such a resource in the future but others are frequent visits i can easily see this one being a resource to which i refer often this site contains very good explanations of the numerous configuration options you see in the bios this truly is a link youll want to keep around this one is already synced to my ipaq
3335426 this is the most comprehensive bios guide available just about every option in a modern bios is explained the best performance setting is usually pointed out and the explanations are easy to follow a must for any overclocker wanna be
3335427 id like to congratulate the author of the bios optimization guide this is absolutely marvelous i was looking specifically for advanced information on the agp aperture size setting and you guys have got ten paragraphs on it
3335428 it was definitely difficult because last night was a finals situation
3335429 i really didnt have the focus i did yesterday i was just looking to get out of my heat ive got more races ahead of me that are more important
3335430 i think emotionally it probably did take a little bit out of me but ive been very careful about what ive been doing and reacting to that
3335431 just play it down and enjoy the moment and focus on the days ahead
3335432 thats my sedan and breath of life dont be obligated the contracted nearness as regards your arse under way my humble self
3335433 ive providential my humble self a charity excluding considering its cambrian in lieu of him as far as accept crutch

3335437 this is in the national interest it is the image of our national music national culture especially the entrance of our national flag this is an extremely important extremely serious matter
3335438 we made the decision that the voice we would use was yang peiyis the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3335439 lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in the aspect of voice yang peiyi is flawless
3335440 we had been through several inspections they were all very strict when we rehearsed at the spot there were spectators from various divisions especially a leader from the politburo who gave us his opinion it must change
3335441 i think it is fair to both lin miaoke and yang peiyi that is to say we have a perfect voice and a perfect image and representation in our teams view combined together
3335442 adults may lie but leave the kids out of it
3335443 we will need more evidence everyone in this situation needs a binding agreement until that happens we are mobilised we are prepared for everything
3335444 there has been more damage to infrastructure and civilian casualties today
3335445 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses
3335446 if this news that military operations are stopping is correct then it is what this country needs and we can then get on to build peace
3335447 this is a beautiful place with a wonderful people they dont deserve the suffering that has been inflicted by military operations
3335448 when you mix all this volatile stuff together and emotions run high its possible for something like this to happen but this agency just cant tolerate it

3335450 in contextul in care piata de e commerc e a avut un start destul de modest in 2008 majoritatea jucatorilor revizuindu si target ul propus initial rezultatele inregistrate in primul semestru al anului ne fac sa privim cu optimism estimarea noastra pentru acest an de 15 milioane dolari pentru cele doua magazine pcfun si electrofun
3335451 decizia de a reinvesti o parte semnificativa a sumelor rezultate din exit ul vikingprofil in dezvoltarea pcfun este direct legata de potentialul de crestere excelent pe care il are in acest moment aceasta afacere exista inca in prezent conceptia gresita ca un magazin online nu necesita investitii de start sau de parcurs dar eu cred ca indiferent daca vorbim despre magazine online sau offline e nevoie de investitii substantiale in dezvoltarea durabila a acestora astfel vom asista in scurt timp la destramarea acestui mit al usurintei cu care se poate obtine succes online fara investitii deoarece estimez ca mai multe magazine online mici si medii vor iesi din piata in perioada urmatoare in lipsa unei finantari corespunzatoare
3335452 with that said we expect that this program will prove we care deeply about those who depend on our company additionally we are convinced that implementing this
3335453 they want to show us and the world how powerful they are tomorrow it will be ukraine and nobody in the west is doing anything to stop them
3335454 why wont america and nato help us if they wont help us why did we help them in iraq

3335456 fawn scott she just broke out of woodburn they arrested her a couple hours ago
3335457 i dont want people to judge my wife just based on this
3335458 theres a lot more to my wife than just this my wife has done good her whole life now this its a nightmare
3335459 it could have been you it could have been your sisters
3335460 this could happen to any woman who has a baby
3335461 im disappointed that the prosecutors office felt it was necessary to bring charges that require a mandatory minimum 13 years on the three firearms charges in prison if convicted
3335462 i believe when this case is ultimately tried and all the facts are brought before the court no jury or judge would feel that any jail time is warranted in this case
3335463 at this point i think its her attorneys obligation to put forth any sort of mitigating evidence if they want us to consider it
3335464 people perceived by them to be addicted to drugs or otherwise in need of cash
3335465 won the senate went home for five weeks without doing anything to lower energy prices or expand supply
3335466 as much about how much an impact the food has on your wallet as on your waistline
3335467 patchwork of ordinances that changes from city to city and county to county
3335468 in general we are opposed to local ordinances but we are committed to achieving a statewide standard
3335469 suddenly the idea of being in a nice big safe market like the united states is a bit more attractive
3335470 people are reassessing where they want their money in this environment
3335471 a wider budget deficit might well be associated with a weaker u s current account outlook and ultimately with more downward pressure on the u s dollar
3335472 one simple fact stands out it was rare for the dollar to lose a significant amount of ground during one of the events
3335473 perhaps even more telling was the markets reaction to russias invasion of afghanistan marking as it did the start of a significant dollar rally
3335474 i am 41 years old and i have been waiting 21 years for this day
3335475 when they got softball in the olympics for the first time my eyes got wide everybody started dreaming and dreaming
3335476 it has been tough we kept telling each other to keep going come on we have to do it we tried we failed we tried we failed and then we made it finally
3335477 never has a women team come to the olympics in any sport in
3335478 we were the first one never had women of a team sport carry the flag and we gained that right to do that
3335479 we came from nothing six years ago and were in the olympics
3335480 i feel bad but i would say this is not the last time there is still a long way to go
3335481 hopefully softball is going to get back and we are going to play them u s again and we are going to be here jumping between those lines hopefully it is going to be like that again
3335482 never allow someone to be your priority while allowing yourself to be their option
3335483 these treatments are cheap but common if you total all the money time and effort spent on them its considerable
3335484 as a direct result of the lack of evidence many couples with unexplained infertility endure and even request expensive potentially hazardous and often unnecessary treatments
3335485 it is extremely difficult to get the bulk funding formula right especially because the pharmacists who would be managing the funding do not write the prescriptions
3335486 its all about reducing the barriers for the patient which is great
3335487 anything that relieves a bit of pressure from gps is welcome
3335488 i havent seen a final report yet and im not going to assume one way or another whats in it
3335489 whatever it says well take it and move forward from there
3335490 the medical examiners office has already given the cause of death and that is not going to change
3335491 neck was broken and he was strangled to death theres nothing that can change that nothing you cant willy nilly come up with a convenient explanation three weeks later of suicide
3335492 we have to decide if we want to protect the health of the citizens
3335493 a lot of people are saying usain and tyson are very strong finishers but if i get out in front of them no matter how they are finishing they wont even close on me
3335494 i did some great things in practice for the past couple of weeks
3335495 this is the first time ive seen my coach so excited so all i have to do is go there and just be like i was in the last two races and i do it
3335496 about two days ago i got pretty upset because since i have been here they have tested me four times and took blood a lot of blood
3335497 they are taking so much blood we are going to be very weak before the finals of the 100 metres
3335498 and i am almost sure i might be tested tomorrow
3335499 i dont know about anybody else but they are really down on my case and my team mate michael frater and usain
3335500 they expect us to be first and second a world record and stuff like that
3335501 andre hornsby was paid 250 000 a year by the people of prince georges county plus a car plus a bonus
3335502 maybe he ruffles feathers but he ruffles them for the right reasons
3335503 they put my name up all over their ads like im in love with them and i really dont like them
3335504 if it was somebody i was happy with that would be one thing but im not happy with them
3335505 accusations and counter accusations between the new patriotic party npp and the national democratic congress ndc over the voter registration exercise can create an atmosphere for a coup detat in the country
3335506 we are creating an atmosphere of tension in the country and there is danger ahead of us there is also an added danger of creating a conducive atmosphere for coup makers to justify the seizure of power
3335507 being transparent as to the availability of resources for the success of the exercise
3335508 electoral frauds like double registration and abuse of the process would endanger the exercise and affect the upcoming general elections

3335517 livin right and bein free means legal access to medical marijuana
3335518 when did it all start who all has a part in this tragedy
3335519 we all know someone took his life but it goes beyond that we know that ronnie didnt wake up that day and say today ill participate in some activity that will result in someones life being lost and later lead to the loss of my life his family his friends the school system certainly the faith community maybe we all have a part in this
3335520 how long will it be until your face will be on one of these t shirts
3335521 i wish i could speak of a long and prosperous life how he had lived life to the fullest of his wife and children and how finally he had succumbed to a death of natural causes
3335522 when it comes to touts i do not know who they are but if i suspect they are touts i will try not to sell tickets to them
3335523 having said that it is not something that we can control to be safe and to avoid the touts it is best that the customers book their tickets earlier rather than waiting until the week before raya
3335524 we only allow four to five tickets per person depending on the availability of seats
3335525 ive always felt like we have the best fans in the nfl and that they would support our team regardless of how they feel about myself or brett or management or whatever
3335526 but it was a great reception when we took the field
3335527 i understand the attention around him his performance tonight and him playing tonight
3335528 but i saw aaron just like he is every day i thought he went out there he played with excellent energy which i always recall him playing with i think hes done a really good job being consistent and understanding that the microphone is on him with all the attention but those are really outside external forces that we cant really pay attention to
3335529 not the sharpest knife in the drawer guess thats why hes a tow truck driver
3335530 sounds like your neighbors are a bunch of slobs too you must be up in the back hills of north carolina with a bunch of hicks who dont care how their homes look wrecker probably fits in to the decor of the neighborhood

3335533 everything was going great until three comics came out each playing
3335534 one was playing heath ledger as the joker and he just kept listing prescription pills he had in his pocket another was playing estelle getty and the third was bernie macs ghost
3335535 she was so freaked out her eyes welled up and she actually bit her nails at one point
3335536 ed cut him off quickly and said id love to see how youre going to make this funny with his puppet
3335537 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3335538 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3335539 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3335540 slightly off topic but that reminds me of saving the butter wrapper to butter your pans with
3335541 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3335542 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3335543 since the introduction of free fees by the then labour minister for education niamh bhreathnach participation at third level has increased but sadly funding has not
3335544 this governments attitude towards students attending third level is woefully inadequate already we have seen the recruitment ban in the hse the proposed streamlining of the grant system which still hasnt happened and now this
3335545 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3335546 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3335547 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3335548 i have heard the taliban have suffered a lot of casualties
3335549 the only way of finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible
3335550 anything we do is cheap compared to what we pay out for foreign oil
3335551 we are very close to a disaster for this country and we have to move as fast as we can
3335552 nach durchsicht des schriftsatzes und der dazu geh renden anlagen des nebeninterventen j rg reinholz sieht es so aus als h tten sie in betrugsabsicht dem lg hamburg gegen ber vors tzlich eine falsche versicherung an eides statt abgegeben herr freiherr von gravenreuth und dann missbrauchen sie noch die gerichte um es dem durch ihren vors tzlich begangenen betrug gesch digten untersagen lassen zu wollen dass sie das lg hamburg belogen haben dann wagen sie sich allen ernstes hier her und behaupten trotz der ihnen vorliegenden und ganz anders lautenden stellungsnahme des lg hamburg es g be eine verf gung die es dem j rg reinholz verbiete zu verbreiten dass sie das lg hamburg belogen h tten wollen sie ein urteil herr freiherr von gravenreuth wir sehen darin einen versuch eines blen missbrauches und damit eine missachtung des gerichtes herr freiherr von gravenreuth

3335554 i know that there are interested parties who read media so its not good to say exactly where the hosting is
3335555 the attackers have inserted a large image made up of several smaller side by side images of pictures of both the georgian president and adolf hitler
3335556 i was feeling really confident going into the second race as i knew i had the pace to be fighting up the front but we made the wrong tyre choice for the re started race and i just didnt have enough grip
3335557 its been a tough weekend a fifth and an eighth isnt what i had hoped for but at the end of the day weve secured some decent championship points and made up some ground on those ahead of me
3335558 im really pleased with the results i got this weekend as i really didnt know if i would be able to ride
3335559 i must say thanks to the cj physios in the medical centre for helping me out so much over the last couple of weekends i really appreciated it
3335560 it was actually worse to ride the bike in the wet as it really made my hand swell up so i was hoping for dry races but we got a bit of both the weather at knockhill always seems to prove a bit of a problem and you never really know what its going to do
3335561 im pleased i could get the results i did for the jentin team as they all worked extremely hard over what was a difficult weekend im feeling a little second hand now but hopefully i will be fighting fit for cadwell park in a couple of weeks time
3335562 the second race was a lottery really with the conditions and on tyre choice and we made the wrong one
3335563 on the sighting lap i realised so we had about a minute to get onto the spare bike with slicks and unfortunately we were too late and had to start from the back of the grid on about the wettest part of the track
3335564 i carved my way through but was disappointed not to finish higher up especially on a day when i so wanted to get a double win
3335565 cal was so disappointed as he felt he was on podium pace but he just couldnt get to grips with that last sector
3335566 the tyre choice for the second part of race two was wrong but we missed the window to get him out on slicks to take his place on the grid either way we now have two riders who are confident of winning in the class which is very positive for the team
3335567 waterpaw from this moment on you will be known as waterleaf starclan honers you trust and skill and welcome you as a full time warrior
3335568 these monsters had started to eat me up on the inside
3335569 there are things that we did with watchmen that could only work in a comic
3335570 lets just make some versions of that with photoshop magic and re create them almost exactly
3335571 following the recent announcement of the name of the driver chosen by the czech republic media in prague to represent the bfgoodrich drivers team on the forthcoming barum rally we were thrilled to learn that no fewer than 133 crews had applied to defend bfgoodrichs colours on the rallye sanremo
3335572 ik was thuis of in de kroeg ik weet het niet meer maar ik was er in elk geval niet bij ik heb nog steeds spijt dat ik iggy pop toen niet gezien heb
3335573 ik heb in de loop der jaren steeds meer werk gekregen
3335574 de eerste jaren maakte ik gewoon een paar ontwerpen die werden dan gefotografeerd en klaar was het nu bemoei ik me bijvoorbeeld ook met de website waar steeds meer onderdelen op zijn die vormgeving nodig hebben
3335575 we hebben er expres voor gezorgd dat mensen een beetje moeten zoeken we houden onze bezoekers graag scherp
3335576 ik sta elk jaar aan het begin van het festival een tijdje bij de t shirt kraam
3335577 dan hoor je elk jaar mensen zeggen de shirts van vorig jaar waren veel beter het is gewoon een kwestie van gewenning na de vijfde lowlands heb ik eens een lezing gegeven over de huisstijl van lowlands mensen in de zaal vonden het verwarrend dat het logo elk jaar veranderde maar lowlands wil juist iedere keer een iets andere sfeer neerzetten het festival is in beweging ik heb wel eens aan jan smeets voorgesteld het logo van pinkpop eens ongesteld af te beelden maar daar wilde hij niets van weten maar misschien moeten we de worstel met een processie door de hoofdingang naar buiten dragen en begraven op camping 1
3335578 vijf minuten voor het optreden waren we ineens john onze gitarist kwijt hij bleek zichzelf opgesloten te hebben in de tourbus we hebben hem met een snijbrander moeten bevrijden voor dat soort dingen heb je op lowlands een speciale man genaamd feiko als je iets nodig hebt kun je bij hem terecht een elastiekje een spijker een stuk touw een strijkijzer je kunt het zo gek niet bedenken of hij kan je eraan helpen eigenlijk drijft het hele festival op hem hoe dan ook bijna ons hele gage van die show is opgegaan aan de reparatie van de bus
3335579 if you reward everyone there will not be enough to go around so you offer a reward to one in order to encourage everyone
3335580 there is a time for everything and a season for every activity under heaven
3335581 in all your ways acknowledge him and he will direct your path
3335582 there has been a strong undercurrrent of negative media about the sanctions law which has probably influenced peoples thinking up there
3335583 the difficulty we have got is that there is so much suspicion and insecurity they are not prepared to give it a trial
3335584 the argument put forward is that it will change the ethos of the game that it caters for all shapes and sizes
3335585 the other concern they have is that the game is not broken and going very well so they are asking why fix it
3335586 statistics from the super 14 in 2007 and 2008 show there are still the same number of scrums line outs are marginally less and the ball is in play marginally longer
3335587 so the core fundamentals havent changed and there will still always be that need for all shapes and sizes
3335588 and while it remains the case that football is still the number one sport up there the northern hemisphere there is room for improvement
3335589 we made some improvements from the heat to the rep and there are things we can work on over the course of the next four days just building as the races go on
3335590 were quite upset as well this is not how we have our protocol set up with our producers
3335591 they have to deal with large scale suppliers the infrastructure of that supply mechanism has the same potential for contamination as conventional meat
3335592 we tend to look at whole foods not only as more nutritious but also safer and were willing to pay a premium for that
3335593 i must say im not surprised to see a single incident
3335594 if it became a regular occurrence like it is with conventional beef i think wed be extremely concerned
3335595 scott i believe that the lord is calling you into the ministry
3335596 for years the ms society has had a library available to support the information needs of people affected by ms but there has been no way for people to search it themselves and access the documents

3335640 if it werent for the savings that we have netted from energy management and the four day work week we would not have been able to do several of the vital things that are going to help us attract and retain even more students
3335641 it was a great thing for me because i became a full time faculty
3335642 the fact that i have that day that one day its just so much nicer and i just dont have to drive all that way to cocoa
3335643 the bank is only open til noon on saturdays so instead of doing it on saturdays i can do it on fridays

3335648 i dont like being thrown in this position where my life is going to get more difficult because of energy savings or whatever reason they decided to do this
3335649 we decided the best and most expeditious course of action was to publicize the artwork to the general public
3335650 whether he was a thief or a good faith purchaser we couldnt come to a conclusion on that
3335651 all we know is he ended up with this stuff
3335652 you know you go through times where you feel it might not happen but you never ever give up hope
3335653 you dont ever use the word never happen its not healthy
3335654 to be in prison for 18 years for something you didnt do and then know you are going to walk out of court a free man thats a lot to take in in one day

3335656 september 2014 is when we are saying we will launch the first crew on the orion
3335657 its the unknown unknowns that we have to hedge against
3335658 having some number of months of schedule flexibility to meet our commitment in addition to having some number of months of cost dollars flexibility is key to keeping ourselves in a healthy posture
3335659 as we looked at the plan we had for september 2013 against the available dollars it became clear to us that we needed to adjust our schedules
3335660 any future steps toward the de escalation of tensions and the restoration of peace will have to be clarified at a later stage
3335661 moreover i wont hide the fact that our approach the russian approach to the negotiation process is going to have to undergo substantial changes because we have lost all remaining trust in the georgian leadership
3335662 the announcement of the end of hostilities by russia is the news that we have been waiting for
3335663 now it is necessary to implement the cease fire and to draw a quick timetable so that everyone returns to the positions they held before the conflict
3335664 i europa skal man nok indstille sig p en h rd opbremsning i konomien i takt med at forventningerne bliver nedjusteret bliver euroen sv kket og det styrker dollaren

3335691 we hope there will be no more groups seeking asylum in australia and other countries in fact with positive developments in the province of west papua we may witness on the opposite side that those who are already enjoying asylum status return to papua
3335692 we would welcome those who reconsider and wish to return
3335693 we are fully aware of the sensitivity even at the highest level of meetings amongst our ministers this has been quietly discussed
3335694 certainly we take into account the domestic and bilateral implications of this problem
3335695 just take your time because regional integration is an evolving process

3335708 the conservative iranian parties are insisting to insult egypt and its people
3335709 irans official stance should be found in the official statements of its leaders and the dealings between the two countries are based on friendship and brotherhood
3335710 this request aims to boost iranian egyptian ties and bring close together muslim different sects especially the sunnis and the shiites

3335719 donde tuvimos 162 expertos en estos temas entre ellos a investigadores inclusive a ingenieros de petr leos ex directores de pemex entre otros donde ya dieron a conocer sus puntos de vista y coinciden en que las iniciativas de felipe calder n son privatizadoras
3335720 pero no a costa de entregar la industria petrolera a la iniciativa privada o a los extranjeros

3335746 in previously funded research the tai chi program developed by li and his team showed positive results in improving balance and reducing falls among the elderly
3335747 the timeframe for companies to get away with greenwashing is shrinking because the consumers are getting much more skeptical of these kinds of these green claims
3335748 green consumer movement is going to collapse because consumers will walk away from false claims
3335749 everyone has thrown their hat in the ring to be green but now comes the time for companies to not just say they are green but to prove it
3335750 the great majority of respondents still believe their shopping decisions can make a difference in the world
3335751 i see how my teenagers watch these ads they are quick to call the b s they are looking for authenticity
3335752 the issue of climate change is too important to be screwing around
3335753 the changes that are coming are going to have big impacts so it is in companies best interest to get their house in order when comes to sustainability and then go out and tell their message to consumers
3335754 it is literally unprecedented for us to put out logo on a product we are a 116 years old so thats a significant change for us
3335755 if the consumer does not understand exactly what that product has done to improve its environmental performance the green washing flags go off
3335756 people are recognizing every single purchase has hidden human and environmental impacts and as a result people are trying to buy a green version of just about everything
3335757 i think the way the government treats our soldiers is really f up they can go to war and fight for our queen and country but if they get their leg blown off they come back and are dealing with the nhs
3335758 i think the nhs is the best thing about this country but they should have a right to private treatment paid for by the government

3335765 our customers are scientists activists professors doctors and more they have the collective experience and knowledge were looking for
3335766 were highlighting exactly what happens in the manufacturing process and asking customers for their suggestions and help in efforts to find solutions to our less sustainable practices its a unique dialogue to engage in but one that will ultimately allow us to cause less harm to the planet
3335767 the chronicles revealed that transportation makes up only about 1 percent of our overall energy use
3335768 had we listened to the current media buzz touting transportation as the largest factor in energy consumption we might have greatly misplaced our efforts by making strides to geographically shorten our supply chain which would have massively impacted our business financially logistically and perhaps even effected product quality and we would only have reduced our energy savings by 1 percent instead we are focusing our energy on areas where we can truly make a difference right in the heart of the manufacturing process
3335769 weve been in business long enough to know that if we can reduce or eliminate a harm other businesses will be eager to follow suit
3335770 many companies will be pleasantly surprised that when they delve into their manufacturing processes they will be able to present a balanced expose of their practices customers will appreciate their honesty and reward them for it

3335800 the bios optimization guide is a one of a kind resource that i refer to anybody who wants to tweak their computers to run the best and i wouldnt refer others to something i wouldnt use myself ive referred to the bog countless times as i upgrade my bios or get a new motherboard the in depth explanations really let you know what each bios option means and which settings these options yield the highest performance and stability
3335801 adrian knows more about tweaking a bios than bill gates knows about windows short and sweet if you own a computer you need to know about the bios and adrian is flat out the authority when it comes to understanding configuring or tweaking a computers bios
3335802 if you ever wanted to know what you can do with your bios adrian has it covered being an admirer for more years than i can count the bios optimization guide is a fantastic journey into the inner workings of a pc at the root level it has taught me how to tweak my pc in a safe way and get the most out of my system period
3335803 it is the one piece of the system that is powered continually
3335804 the bios optimization guide is a truly useful resource for those looking to get the most out of their systems i often point people to the bog to learn more about memory timings and what they mean
3335805 95 of all bios optimizations that i now know i learned from rojak pots guide and so did everyone else if they tell you different they are not telling the you the truth or they read it on a site that stole the information from his
3335806 whether you are an overclocking uber geek or a first time computer user adrians bios optimization guide is a must i can truthfully say that 90 of what i have learned about bios optimization has been through the use of adrians guide why else would i refer to him as the king of the bios
3335807 adrian has done the tech community a great service by making this guide it has personally saved me time on both repairs and evaluations with bios options as numerous as they are today its wonderful to have a one stop source to decipher them all
3335808 you know i couldnt count the amount of times ive referred people to your bios guideelits very informative and saves me the time of explaining why people should disable video bios shadowing why fast writes isnt such a big deal for todays games and much more
3335809 just wanted to say thanks for saving me time and also helping me out i learned a lot from it too keep up the most excellent work
3335810 this isnt so much a knowledge base but a labor of love not only has this guide had a place in both titchs and my favorites for many years but im really excited to see it still going after many many years well done adrian keep up the excellent work
3335811 adrian wong of adrians rojak pot has been building up his bios guide since late 1999
3335812 this is one of the most comprehensive and user friendly guides i have found to date i was able to do various tweaks with my mem cpu that increased my overall system performance by about 15 many of the bios tweaks will depend on your mobo and whether certain options are even available in your bios menu however i do recommend that even ppl that arent familiar with working with the bios give it a go with this guide really helps to answer all your questions
3335813 some bookmarks occupy space in my favorites folder just in case i need such a resource in the future but others are frequent visits i can easily see this one being a resource to which i refer often this site contains very good explanations of the numerous configuration options you see in the bios this truly is a link youll want to keep around this one is already synced to my ipaq
3335814 this is the most comprehensive bios guide available just about every option in a modern bios is explained the best performance setting is usually pointed out and the explanations are easy to follow a must for any overclocker wanna be
3335815 id like to congratulate the author of the bios optimization guide this is absolutely marvelous i was looking specifically for advanced information on the agp aperture size setting and you guys have got ten paragraphs on it

3335843 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
3335844 because you think you dont know but deep inside you know the answer it is simply a hard truth that you need to face something to think about on your next little boat ride

3335847 our goal is to make it easier for little league and its players to raise funds online so they can focus on playing ball
3335848 we believe this is the future of fundraising this technology allows our supporters to contribute to a custom fundraising event for their local little league theres no need for kids to go door to door to raise money playing casual games online makes giving fun for contributors and the platform is cost effective and rewarding for all our leagues

3335859 how did you develop the part number for this clutch
3335860 well since the numeric sequence does not really mean anything i figured it did not matter what they were and nothing is as good as something
3335861 if nothing is defined by what it is not and not by what it is then something that does not look like it is something must be nothing even if it is something
3335862 it is like taking illiterates into a room writing hoax on the wall and telling them that is the word for god they accept it as truth brilliance and learning when all the time no one knows you are playing them for the fool and making it up as you go along

3335865 lo m s increible de trabajar con rick es que el nunca est dir a que es un punto muy fuerte en el que l se marcha y nos deja a los cuatro tomar las riendas del trabajo y las decisiones de como funcionar n los procesos de composici n y grabaci n por supuesto rick estuvo all gran parte del proceso cuando grabamos las voces y la bater a pero el hecho de que estuvieramos aislados en nuestro estudio trabajando en los temas por nuestra cuenta marc una gran diferencia porque eso hizo que nuestro sonido se mantuviera puro tuvimos m s metallica en ese sentido que cuando estabamos con bob rock
3335866 en cierto modo s y por otro lado n lo ultimo que quiero es que alguien piense oh han tenido que volver al sonido de master of puppets porque ese fu su mejor disco y lo han hecho porque nosotros quer amos si empezamos a escribir temas para nuestros fans es que algo no va bien los fans pueden pensar que son quienes mejor lo saben pero oye que yo tambi n creo que soy el juez de linea cuando estoy viendo jugar a mi equipo al final de cada dia tenemos que componer porque nos encanta y porque sale de nuestors corazones por eso la gente luego conecta con los temas si empiezas a hacerlo por los fans pierde todo el sentido
3335867 somos conscientes de que hab a una esencia una juventud hab a algo un por qu en ese disco refiendose a master of puppets y este es el momento perfecto para otro disco as porque la vieja escuela del metal es enorme y est volviendo y hay much sima gente con ganas de tocar y componen riffs solos amo todo eso as que con este disco para nosotros es como empezar de nuevo
3335868 rick rubin nos dijo intentad retroceder hasta master of puppets qu hac as en qu pensabais cuales eran vuestras influencias qu os molestaba de d nde ven a vuestra ambici n y esa era una tarea que para nosotros era un poco imposible conseguir puedes vestirte como si estuvieras en 1986 pero nunca estar s realmente all de nuevo hemos pasado por muchas cosas y no podemos obviar toda la experiencia que tenemos
3335869 enfoquemoslo as nuestro pr ximo disco sale en septiembre y el d a que salga a la venta tambi n estar disponible en el formato guitar hero 3 con lo que obviamente estamos flipando mis hijos juegan a guitar hero todos los d as y que sea posible hacerlo con el disco de metallica el mismo dia que sale es genial

3335872 in his campaign commercial the one john mccain stoops to a new low in his attack on barack obamas christian faith and character using the same style as his celebrity commercial mccain portrays obama as arrogant self righteous and messianic true to his christian beliefs obama knows that every follower of jesus is supposed to serve all humanity to love all neighbors and in that sense to be a blessing to all people during his campaign obama has not shied away from affirming his own christian values especially in the area of practical love and service for all as a consequence obama has attracted more christians and followers of other faiths than democrats typically achieve for example polls indicate obama doing 8 15 better among evangelical christians than kerry did this has become very problematic for mccains chances and republicans in general fighting back the one commercial paints obama as a messianic figure even greater than moses his religious quotes are taken totally out of their original context and placed in a setting where the insinuation is not very subtle obama could be the anti christ although a small fringe of fundamentalist christians might believe this absurdity these people would not have voted for obama anyway i believe while mccain is attempting to secure and stir up his right wing religious base he runs the serious risk of turning off the very important independent voters in the middle he is appealing to fear in ways reminiscent of bushs mushroom cloud voters with religious convictions want their beliefs to be treated with respect most will see through this shameful commercial for what it is a distorted abuse of peoples faith for political purposes most will recognize that a text without its true context is a pretext a candidates commercial even when it is an attack on ones opponent is really an expression of the candidates own core values in my opinion mccains claim to integrity has significantly slipped
3335873 then they were on the road they preached with joyful urgency that life can be radically different
3335874 will not go down at all well at the bank
3335875 the rise in consumer price inflation to a series high of 4 4 per cent in july was well above expectations furthermore the rise cannot be attributed solely to sharply higher food and energy prices worryingly core inflation spiked up to 1 9 per cent in july from 1 6 per cent in june which raises concern that higher energy and food prices are increasingly having second round inflationary effects
3335876 the inflation figures are a further headache for the bank of england which is torn between the imperative to tame inflation and the need to provide a stimulus to the wider economy but so far the market response to the inflation numbers has been pretty sanguine
3335877 just a few weeks ago the ftse 100 was flirting with 5 000 but now it is 500 or so points higher if the ftse 100 closes higher today then it confirms the recent bullish run and suggests the market is happy to shrug off bad news how long that mood will last remains to be seen
3335878 h1 first half eps earnings per share is 2 per cent ahead of forecast and the results demonstrate good growth due to a strong recovery in contribution from the owned and leased properties growth was slower in the managed and franchised hotels but their ebit earnings before interest and tax still increased by 9 per cent we believe ihgs longer term prospects are underpinned by a strong pipeline and the 28k rooms signed in the most recent quarter suggest that developer interest in ihgs brands remains strong
3335879 the background is that indian law precludes foreign direct investment in multi brand retail although international retailers have been striking franchise and partnership agreements with local retailers and industrial conglomerates to allow entry to what is expected to be a large and fast growing market over the coming years
3335880 the continued dominance of wholesale versus consumer banking profits is set to reduce overall returns for the group with pressures on the groups capital position likely to necessitate a sharp slowdown in asset growth or the need to raise equity at some stage although standard chartered operates in regions where economic growth has remained resilient rising inflationary pressure in asia represents a risk to this scenario we believe this will act as a cap on the groups rating with earnings potentially disappointing as asset growth slows next year

3335896 following an approach by local media avon fire and rescue service has confirmed reports that a fire alarm activated in the pavilion building at grand pier at 01 35am on monday 28 july
3335897 however this information forms part of the ongoing investigation and the cause of the fire remains unknown
3335898 i am not prepared to speculate about anything ahead of the publication of the official report into the cause of the fire
3335899 i have every confidence in the investigation being carried out jointly between the police the fire service and insurers and i am sure we will all know exactly what happened in due course until that time i urge everyone to avoid speculation as it only causes further distress to those involved
3335900 se ha quitado algo muy importante a los grupos de chiclana

3335909 first georgian troops should return to their initial position and be partly demilitarised second we need to sign a binding agreement on non use of force
3335910 we will need more evidence everyone in this situation needs a signed binding agreement until that happens we are mobilised we are prepared for everything
3335911 i do appreciate it president medvedevs gesture but there has been more damage to infrastructure and civilian casualties today
3335912 finally the international community began to speak with one voice and is beginning to get the message through that this behaviour is unacceptable

3335918 the government will take steps to engage all the groups concerned from jammu as well as the kashmir valley in talks so that the issues could be resolved amicably to the satisfaction of all concerned
3335919 each accelerator will showcase how the microsoft dynamics crm 4 0 platform can be configured and extended to broaden marketing sales and service capabilities
3335920 they are building out functionality that our partners and clients have been asking for
3335921 for instance the e service accelerator allows user to integrate crm cases into a web site and set up a workflow for these cases the sales methodology accelerator provides integration for leading firms like miller heiman
3335922 content marketing in my definition is the ability to produce useful and entertaining information that is worthwhile on its own but that might also be useful towards a sale or subsequent action traditional marketing efforts the slick and shiny kind are like red licorice
3335923 but what if instead you wrote up some really great suggestions for how one might do that certain job better with or without your product and then made a very simple link back to whatever your product offer might be which would offer more value to your prospective customer
3335924 slower yes more effort yes but i believe the results will speak for themselves
3335925 you will start to accumulate relationships with people who actually care about the space where your company is doing business and might actually benefit from your product service

3335949 it is important for them to see that the system does work
3335950 if we dont use those monies i guarantee you other communities will
3335951 it will demonstrate that chillicothe is indeed a progressive community
3335952 its a big chunk of money and i think the public needs to get time to ask questions
3335953 its so intriguing because thats a facility where someone who has been displaced because of globalization can receive assistance and training for a field like nursing
3335954 theres nothing wrong with having a 45 or 50 year old factory worker take a look at jobs in the energy and health care fields
3335955 those people who are most in need of access to broadband also tend to be those who least realize the importance of it
3335956 sometimes it takes governmental loans and tax incentives and we need to do that in cooperation with the industry
3335957 the relationships we have forged with members of the community local business people and entrepreneurs has been great
3335958 the foreman shall indorse on such indictment the words a true bill and subscribe his name as foreman
3335959 the question is whether the lack of words a true bill affect the substantive right of mr bunstine
3335960 this does not stop him from defending himself in a trial against the charges
3335961 i think we can all agree that this is a very unusual circumstance
3335962 its really up to prosecutors office on how they proceed from here
3335963 i do not think its heading to a new trial
3335964 to be in prison for 18 years for something you didnt do and then know you are going to walk out of court a free man thats a lot to take in in one day
3335965 this fact has seemingly surprised a number of progressive people who are bemoaning obamas shift to the center its sad that some who seek progressive change are missing the forest for the trees
3335966 but they will not dampen the wide and deep enthusiasm for blocking a third bush term represented by john mccain or for bringing obama by a landslide into the white house with a large democratic congressional majority
3335967 the struggle to defeat the ultra right and turn our country on a positive path will not end with obamas election
3335968 but that step will shift the ground for successful struggles going forward

3335974 asked guy at staples which chair will work best in an oval shaped office
3335975 offered mccain a job in gift shop at the obama presidential library
3335976 the bombs that are falling on us they have an inscription on them this is for nato this is for the u s
3335977 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3335978 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3335979 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3335980 the georgians say it is their land where is our land then

3335992 i was impressed simply by the fact that he was quick to study
3335993 you saw that he was able to step out there and step into the huddle get lined up and deliver the ball around he is a very sharp guy thats obvious of course he has a ways to go in terms of catching up but i thought it was a very good start today
3335994 it looks like he is knocking the rust off pretty quickly so we anticipate that he will participate on thursday unless we have some kind of set back between now and then
3335995 i think we will have more information after we play thursday night
3335996 we will prepare for buffalo and be ready for those guys but its not a complete game preparation as we would prepare for an opponent during the season our focus is getting better and competing steelers vs steelers and trying to sort out who our best people are tomorrow we will come out and work toward buffalo a little bit but the business of today was about guys getting better

3336004 exxon johns out of touch agenda may be a boon for big oil but its a bust for americas working families
3336005 exxon mccain 08 is the perfect ticket for big oil because only mccain looks at record profits and promises 4 billion more the choice in this election is perfectly clear if you want four more years of flawed energy policies dominated by gimmicks and giveaways for big oil vote for exxon john in november

3336008 until the kashmir dispute is resolved the anti india sentiments will stay the protests should open the eyes of indians that kashmiris are not with them
3336009 the indians were flaunting that the freedom sentiment among the kashmiris has ended they cant make such claims now
3336010 we want freedom and we will continue our struggle until we are free
3336011 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored
3336012 we must draw up a rapid calendar so that each side can go back to the positions of before the crisis
3336013 my first three medal races weve done everything ive wanted to do
3336014 the olympics have been around for so many years its a pretty amazing accomplishment
3336015 its definitely an honor ive been able to spend some time with carl lewis and traded a few words with spitz here and there
3336016 with all the emotion that went into that i just had to force myself to put it out of my head
3336017 its not easy but with so many races i know i have so much to do in every race
3336018 the way natalie swam and of course michael had an absolutely beautiful race i dont think we could have planned it any better the u s team is absolutely snowballing and hopefully we can keep it going
3336019 what michael is doing is certainly elevating everybodys performance here were a team and we cheer each other on

3336043 the colonsentry test is a breakthrough risk assessment tool that provides a more accurate and reliable basis for recommending colonoscopies than demographic benchmarks or the less sophisticated occult blood stool test we believe that these traditional guidelines result in overlooked risk for the patient
3336044 alternatively this patient friendly blood test will provide diagnostic information to allow physicians to make better decisions regarding next steps in the colorectal cancer screening process ultimately the colonsentry tm test may help identify the presence of this cancer in patients at a curable stage providing individualized preventative health care for our patients which is fundamental to scientas core commitment to our patients
3336045 scienta is a leader in individualized preventive medicine and as the first executive health clinic to offer our colonsentry test their patients will now have access to this unique and powerful risk assessment tool among their robust suite of health care services

3336048 weve made important recent progress in two of our product platforms including the initiation of the first of two new phase 2 trials for our active cellular immunotherapy provenge as well as the presentation of promising new preclinical data on d 3263 our first small molecule product candidate
3336049 our foremost priority remains advancing provenge through the approval process and we look forward to october when the interim analysis of our ongoing phase 3 impact trial will be completed
3336050 in recent months nventa has achieved important clinical milestones with our lead hspe7 program phase 1 clinical findings demonstrated the immunologic activity of hspe7 in treating cin and allowed us to identify an optimal dosing range as we advance toward phase 2 development
3336051 beyond hspe7 we made an important addition to the nventa product pipeline during the quarter with the development of our proprietary and highly potent adjuvant poly icr as this unique tlr3 agonist may have application in both therapeutic as well as prophylactic vaccines it represents a highly valuable asset to the company
3336052 this was a vibrant airport at one time and there is no question that theres a lot of demand for transit back and forth between this area and halifax and potentially into the united states
3336053 we have identified five candidate airlines for service and we already know that there is a group of businesses around the yarmouth area that were going to be touching base with to talk about what their demand is
3336054 we think that we can see once we get the service going at least a minimum of three days a week round trip service at a reasonable cost and hopefully expand it from there
3336055 the reality in all of this is anyway you look at it southwestern nova scotia is immensely dependent on transportation
3336056 and all of the things that the port is thinking about and the airport is thinking about as well as tourism if you dont have a good transportation system in the area your lifeline is gone

3336060 could provide explicit recognition that human rights come with responsibilities and must be exercised in a way that respects the human rights of others

3336067 we recommended the march networks mobile solution based on its rugged design and its exceptional video management software
3336068 the ability to monitor video in real time and download recorded video automatically over a wireless network provides the ministry with outstanding efficiency while the locking capability helps them ensure compliance with operating processes and prevents revenue loss
3336069 we are pleased to provide mexico citys public safety ministry with an innovative ip video solution that uniquely addresses its environmental and operational challenges
3336070 this new business further expands our existing customer base in the high growth mexican market and demonstrates the networking expertise and core video management functionality that differentiates our offering
3336071 even though the second quarter is usually our second weakest quarter of the year due to seasonality we are proud to report strong operating and financial results while maintaining a solid balance sheet the key contributing factor to this favourable performance is related to the gross margin earned on harvesting and sales of logs from our integrated plantation operations the cost of harvesting was much lower in the second quarter compared to the first quarter and the average selling price increased 4 to 107 per m 3 as a result we recorded a gross profit margin of 40 per m 3 at our integrated plantation operations which exceeded both our guidance of 20 to 23 per m 3 and our first quarter result of 28 per m 3 as we continue to ramp up our integrated plantation operations this year we will be on track to begin large scale replanting in hunan in 2009
3336072 at our purchased and planted plantations we recorded a consolidated 7 increase in log prices excluding currency appreciation compared to a year ago
3336073 we are also very pleased to have entered into another long term master agreement to acquire 200 000 hectares of trees at a cost not to exceed rmb350 m3 in fujian province located along the south eastern costal area and under chinas 11th five year plan designated among the top three provinces to supply wood fibre to the market fujian is a province where we have been operating since 2001 this strategic acquisition will further strengthen our position as a leading national supplier of quality wood fibre
3336074 for god so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life
3336075 god shows his love for us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us
3336076 he who believes in the son has eternal life he who does not obey the son shall not see life but the wrath of god rests upon him
3336077 with every freely committed mortal sin he offends god as the giver of the law and as a result becomes guilty with regard to the entire law cf james 2 10 11 even if he perseveres in faith he loses sanctifying grace and eternal happiness

3336085 ah non mais je pose pas de velux sur ce type de toiture
3336086 its the most important thing i think i will ever do as the governor
3336087 why do you want to be on the supreme court
3336088 i think many of us have thought since we were young about being on the supreme court
3336089 one of the big problems with our branch of government is when the economy turns south our work picks up
3336090 foreclosures are up in multiples in florida at a time when we dont have the money to keep the courts open
3336091 when development proposals come before you have the science developed you end up with development limiting options for restoration
3336092 what were trying to achieve here is really to create a balance between economic development our sugar operation and the environment
3336093 you have 1 700 people here who are waiting for some kind any kind of answer
3336094 unfortunately the credit crunch hit at the same time as portability
3336095 if we werent experiencing that portability would be really really impressing people it will work for us yet im utterly convinced of that
3336096 people are afraid to take on any greater financial responsibility right now
3336097 any way you cut it whether its one home or 1 000 homes were better off with portability
3336098 i bet i answer two dozen portability questions a day theyre thinking about it but they want to know how much further do i think home prices will drop and when will it end
3336099 insurers do not file rate requests unless they believe theres an actual and demonstrable need
3336100 to minimize the probability of ruin to a number in the vicinity of one in 250 years is completely reasonable given its fiduciary responsibility
3336101 its completely acceptable for the state run insurer to go bankrupt because they can effectively tax everybody in the whole state that cannot happen with a company like state farm which has millions of policyholders all over the country
3336102 the homeowners insurance market in florida has historically been a large scale money loser for the industry overall
3336103 rates will need to rise and or risk will need to further decrease
3336104 state farm and allstate are not going to write more policies for more premium theyve made that very clear
3336105 so what we have to do is to rely on the smaller companies were very comfortable with that model
3336106 we have fewer rated insurance carriers than weve ever had
3336107 weve had suppressed rates for quite some time which has led to little competition
3336108 as long as people are forced to buy homeowners insurance as a determining condition of their mortgage and as long as companies have no responsibility in terms of their quality of service i think we need to bring some equilibrium to the marketplace
3336109 we didnt have actuarially sound rates because oir for whatever reason could say were not going to approve this
3336110 the majority of homeowners rates have gone up but ive seen peoples rates come down
3336111 and most of the time its by shopping and comparing rates
3336112 we just want to be treated with fairness and respect
3336113 id just like to ask them eyeball to eyeball and say im a cpa by profession so numbers mean a lot to me to show me what justifies a 47 percent increase
3336114 the key is support for the filing and for the rate thats being requested
3336115 its the most important thing i think i will ever do as the governor
3336116 there are a lot of folks who are anxiously looking at the court to see how these decisions are going to come out
3336117 you could have decisions without a full court but i think its in the communitys best interest that these decisions come down as quickly as possible
3336118 my guess is that the departing justices will be careful to tidy up their casework before they leave and that relatively few decisions will be held up
3336119 the economics would say otherwise we would be in sugar stronger
3336120 one hypothesis i have is the heirs of charles mott want the money thats not the first time thats happened in florida agriculture
3336121 facol and signals and controllers limited are responsible for the maintenance of the traffic light
3336122 keep on receiving the same complaints of power fluctuations hit and run drivers obsolete spare parts and thieves stealing parts of the lights making replacements very difficult
3336123 i am sorry we are not responsible for the traffic lights but go to urban roads and they would help you
3336124 even where you are lucky enough to get some of the spare parts of these obsolete traffic lights they are very expensive as compared to replacing the traffic lights entirely
3336125 under this project all the 138 signalized systems in accra will be computerized monitored and controlled from one control room this means the issue of non functional traffic lights will soon be a thing of the past

3336130 i turned around to my dad and said thats exactly what i want to do
3336131 he goes its not how many times you get knocked down but its how many times you get back up and go forward carl latz said his son told him
3336132 and i told him thats exactly what this is all about and if nothing else this letter just taught you a life lesson
3336133 well the law prohibits it and the legislature enacted the laws to protect the health safety and welfare of all children
3336134 it seems totally unbelievable that somebody would even go to that extreme to send a letter to somebody let alone looking to find something about child labor laws
3336135 if my doors close and i never open again and this boy becomes successful then i will be the happiest person in the world
3336136 its strange that a kid at this age would glean onto this particular kind of music and show the intensity and kind of the ability to function as kind of 8 year old blues guy
3336137 it would be unusual to find an 8 year old who can play joe satriani licks
3336138 ive had more people tell me they say its a kids body but it has a 70 year old dude inside
3336139 i think its so much you can do on the guitar

3336141 the first unhcr humanitarian airlift flight carrying relief supplies for civilians affected by the south ossetia conflict arrived in georgia this morning as the estimated number of people uprooted by the fighting approached 100 000
3336142 that would amount to some 56 000 people from gori on the move officials said most had gone toward tbilisi and that most would return home once the threat subsided
3336143 the situation on the ground is deteriorating sparking a significant movement of population
3336144 we need unrestricted humanitarian access to the civilian population and to the wounded and to enable medical personnel and ambulances to take care of the dead and wounded
3336145 one of our top priorities when it is possible will be to get safe drinking water to tskhinvali
3336146 mr solana welcomed this decision he recalled the importance of peace and stability in the region and expressed the eus readiness to contribute actively to a solution to the crisis
3336147 large parts of the georgian military have been knocked out by the russian air and ground attacks
3336148 the goal appears to be to damage georgia militarily and economically to such an extent that its capacity to resist politically is severely weakened after that i expect political conditions for an end to the conflict will be dictated
3336149 the current issue affecting the market is largely about the supply of credit a very different situation to the early 90s which was about high interest rates and

3336154 youd have people pulling out a cell phone to look up a number and then dialing it on the pay phone it was getting ridiculous
3336155 youd call and get an answering machine that said literally youve reached the phone company
3336156 im not going to combat one illegality with a petty act of crime
3336157 what finally happened was that we annoyed the owners to the point where they felt that discretion was the better part of valor
3336158 a pay phone should be something like a bar that has to get a liquor license
3336159 people should be allowed to protest a phone just like they can protest a liquor license

3336200 displacement in the citys a result of shortsighted and predatory planning which completely devalues and destroys the relationship between people places community networks and institutions look at what the ilitch familys doing
3336201 i probably should exercise i have the body of a 90 year old
3336202 im more interested in those into rap and hip hop who are interested in making a community
3336203 there are so many different kinds of communities it just comes down to mutual support
3336204 its not just self interest a lot of times its about pushing each other to grow its about solving larger problems but solving them collectively
3336205 look there are many points when i thought i suck when i think why am i doing this
3336206 at 15 id have to sneak into clubs so me and my dj found places to throw shows
3336207 back then this neighborhood had a different dynamic blacks iranians iraqis
3336208 ann arbor puts itself out there as a liberal college town but theres racism underneath they might not talk of the disproportionate youth imprisonment
3336209 white picket fences green lawns nice rich expensive college campus so progressive every child advances lies and deception
3336210 was so excited to move to the u s i ran and fell on the front stoop of the house and
3336211 internalized and battled my own depression from a very young age
3336212 for me it was a thing where i was the odd one out i didnt know the language and my gender presentation was always androgynous i got used to actually being comfortable being the odd one out
3336213 when i got into music i was able to connect with people on a deeper level
3336214 i channeled all my pain growing up my family my thoughts on things i was an observer i channeled all that into my writing
3336215 thats why im so mellow about booze and drugs now
3336216 taking mostly independent studies with a few teachers who had my back
3336217 more than anything those folks inspired me to go this route
3336218 and i met her on my second visit when a mutual friend introduced us i moved to new york a year later and stayed with her my first month in new york till i found my own spot
3336219 i also worked at a health food store and did some shady late night fliering
3336220 we were about getting together writing recording and performing thats it and it really centered around performing so we spent a lot of that time going from show to show writing the material but having a lot of live recorded cuts of our shows but never any formal recordings
3336221 the five of us are very passionate about what we believe in
3336222 and when it comes to humanity when it comes to activism i feel like those two themes are very synonymous with who we are
3336223 and we had a lot of issues with producers us showing up as who we were and we werent changing and invincibles history was pretty intense during that time and id say as feisty teenagers
3336224 or early 20s young adults for us it was no compromise
3336225 and still to this day we still do a lot of colleges
3336226 after throwing a benefit event in new york for detroit based organization freedom house i then started supporting detroit summer hip hop related events while still living in new york and was asked to move here detroit in 2002 to coordinate their events and media outreach year round
3336227 it was heartbreaking it felt like um it felt like at that time it felt like the end of a dream because we had functioned for so many years together five years so it felt like the end of a dream it was painful i mean there were tears
3336228 mccarthy ist attitudes toward itself its foreigners and the arts
3336229 when i moved to new york i met several community organizing groups which gave me insight into more creative visionary and effective ways of making change and then connecting with detroit summer showed me the possibilities are endless
3336230 its the idea of the importance of visionary thinking reclaiming rebuilding and respiriting the city
3336231 organizes youth led media arts projects and community wide potlucks speak outs and parties
3336232 i dont sleep much now its hard to tour and be a community organizer i mean community organizing is all about building local relationships
3336233 it opened my eyes and im learning skills that i can apply i love seeing the people evolve with their creativity
3336234 the video is about different forms of transformative justice getting to the root of criminalization among minors is the main theme
3336235 its basically a study of business people coming together to make a better city to increase the high school graduation rate its also about re envisioning society specifically detroit because of what it represents in the industrial revolution and being the first on the decline
3336236 a creative effective vision based self sustainable reflective and constantly evolving organizing model here in detroit
3336237 in 1992 a number of us including my late husband james boggs shea howell myself felt that what we really needed to do was to get young people involved in the rebuilding and the redefining and re spiriting of the city
3336238 and until we did that the city would continue to deteriorate as it was doing already
3336239 detroit summer started doing some things which were almost magical i mean they began working with older people for example who were already planting community gardens and who called themselves the garden ing angels
3336240 and there was something about using vacant lots which had appeared as only blight become sources of healthy food and also as the older people felt not only for food but to give young people a sense of process which you dont get in the city and its an urban agricultural movement which has taken on fantastic dimensions and then there were all sorts of hope gardens food gardens and hospital gardens and senior citizens gardens and school gardens not only because of summer i think because of the image that we could create something new
3336241 thats partly because people like ilana were coming around her first responsibility was providing opening ceremonies in detroit summer block parties in efforts to reclaim the city her first hip hop festival in new york in 2000 drew 400 people
3336242 its to connect youth leadership groups in impacted communities in the u s and palestine mostly the west bank in order to exchange strategies of nonviolent resistance and build relationships through joint media based projects
3336243 most of my israeli family who live there refused to see me or speak to me once they learned that i was going to be working with palestinians in the west bank
3336244 nationalism was more important to them than family or our relationship other israeli members of the family cut me off after the trip my israeli family seems to think that anyone not living there has no say in the matter but in reality 20 million u s tax dollars a day go to israeli military aid so all of us living here have something at stake and beyond that injustice anywhere is injustice everywhere it was important for me to go back in a way that was connected to my local work in detroit and was able to build true solidarity
3336245 her sister who she was staying with on this rare visit kicked her out of the house when she found out about the protest
3336246 this and my moms continued commitment to the injustices in the region has actually brought us much closer than weve ever been
3336247 ilana was there and we met purely by chance and things went from there
3336248 theyve always been in my corner and featured me on several of their tracks as well as produced many of mine over the years the first beat i knew had to be on this album was sledgehammer which kt produced along with haircut from the labtechs a lot of other people were trying to buy that beat from them but they held on to it for me because they knew the importance it held for me as a launching pad for the rest of the album
3336249 on a national level you keep hitting them over the head with a new album whether its invincible finale or 14kt or slum village or whatever
3336250 with this album i wanted to create a model so anyone can do it
3336251 thats how i got the record pressed again its about a community of people
3336252 swinging sledgehammers for a minimum wage renovate a dv shelter for women with aids
3336253 its a tight rope noose a tug of war whatever
3336254 those who bring skills and sincerity to the art form
3336255 with most people the preconceived notions fall away when they hear my music and recognize the commitment i have to the craft and culture
3336256 finale and i picked the same beat off of a house shoes beat cd and decided to collab on it
3336257 the concept is based on the forgotten and untold stories of detroit the historic and current effects of disinvestment abandonment and urban renewal on displacing community residents and juxtaposing sustainable versus unsustainable development
3336258 finale and i worked with jenny lee to create a radio piece about the effects this sporting event had on neighborhood residents
3336259 including the downtown motown building which was actually demolished for a parking lot that wasnt even paved in time
3336260 which would include many more community voices and perspectives on issues related to land use and then asked joe to collaborate with me and direct the piece joe is the founder of the other detroit arab artist collective who all came on board to make it happen
3336261 me and my best friend would rap on this in fourth grade make crank calls an shit
3336262 finale miz korona buff1 marvwon 14kt vaughan t quest mcody guilty simpson 5 ela elzhi black milk nametag big tone mr porter karriem riggins one be lo magestik legend taraach buried glory and bo town
3336263 people arent fully going to understand until they see me perform
3336264 and i didnt have access to the resources i needed to do things properly ive had opportunities to get signed or have certain resources available to me but with strings attached that would have completely corrupted the spirit of my work
3336265 it smells like a big fart huh just one big fart

3336277 he saw this picture and obviously for him it was very easy to recognise the girl accompanied by a woman in a veil

3336287 when i sent in my first tape to the head of gramophone programmes at the bbc i had made the fatal mistake of forgetting to rewind it to the start
3336288 yet that gentleman took the time to wind it all the way back and once hed listened to it things went from there
3336289 i can tell you if i was a young chap coming over from ireland today they probably wouldnt even listen to my tape let alone rewind it
3336290 somehow that old fashioned thoroughness and commitment have disappeared i suppose no one has the time for it any more
3336291 when i started people who worked for the bbc knew they werent earning as much as people in commercial television but they did have the satisfaction of knowing that they worked for one of the finest if not the finest broadcasting organisation in the whole world
3336292 im not sure they feel that any more or at least that it means as much as it used to

3336306 shouldnt be relying on a government penalty to attract customers they should be offering attractive affordable policies
3336307 mr kalisch made the point a point i have made many times that many of the claims by insurance companies and others about the impact this might have on premiums are vastly exaggerated
3336308 he also made the point that there are a range of complex factors that drive premium growth the fact is that if the insurance companies produce attractive affordable policies then people will continue to buy them
3336309 any premium increases will have to be approved by the commonwealth and i have made clear to the insurance companies that i will not accept their attempts to use this as an excuse to hike premiums
3336310 the governments motivation to save money means they are simply increasing the bills for 10 million australians with private health insurance
3336311 some people may scoff at that number but weve done the math

3336353 i think well go in there probably a little bit more fired up a little bit sharper i think half our team its their first olympic games so coming off two wins especially a big one especially like this i think its going to help the team a lot to give us that extra confidence
3336354 were finding a way to win and thats the most important thing
3336355 were going to have to learn to play from behind and learn to play when were hit too
3336356 one of our most versatile players a great swimmer with great speed and strength
3336357 we thought getting here and getting settled in figuring out the routines and what the pool situation was i think it was an advantage for us really
3336358 im happy we did it it didnt make sense to me that so many teams were coming in three days before the tournament started because some of those teams got no time even to practice in the competition venue before they started playing i dont think the smogs been really a factor our guys havent complained about it at all

3336360 in the bar councils case the forum was aimed at helping clarify legal and administrative provisions on religious conversion issues which could have provided useful inputs on helping resolve recent controversial developments
3336361 in fact the organisers had taken the initiative to invite distinguished speakers from the federal territory religious affairs department and institute of islamic understanding malaysia although both withdrew after the forum was demonised by some quarters
3336362 finally we note with concern and condemn the petrol bombs attack directed at the previous house of bar council president ambiga sreenevasan we hope that there is no connection between that act and the role of the bar council in organising the seminar and call on the authorities to fully investigate that action and bring the perpetrators to book
3336363 the use of abusive language aggression and threats to halt the forum are un islamic undemocratic and goes against the principles of islam
3336364 we also condemn the act of passing judgment on the forum based on assumptions only
3336365 if they the leaders were not even inside how would they know if the forum was aimed at attacking islam it would have been better if the protestors attended the forum and gave their own views and opinions instead of sullying the image of islam
3336366 freedom of religion is fundamental human rights enshrined in the universal declaration of human rights article 18 and guaranteed by the federal constitution article 11
3336367 this basic constitutional right should not be overruled by the authorities or by mainstream interpretation of religion
3336368 we cannot just treat every issue as sensitive in fact the bar council forum was a platform for various groups to engage in discussion in a peaceful manner in seeking a solution
3336369 the organizers did not intend to confront anybody but to hear the different perspectives and sought to find a solution to avoid these issues from repeatedly occurring
3336370 this issue has been in existence even before the shamalah case and the government has taken too long to resolve this issue people want to see action they dont only want to hear promises by the government
3336371 where a spouse or family member has embraced islam the conversion effectively has an effect on the non muslim family members since it involves human rights with regards to the welfare of family members who have not converted
3336372 there are custodial problems where minor children are involved and inheritance issues too
3336373 the bureau hopes that bar council will continue to conduct similar programs to discuss conversion issues in the future and it is not afraid to state its stand on the matter
3336374 at the same time the bureau also advises political leaders not to issue irresponsible statements in trying to distort the real issue at hand
3336375 the fact remains that on one side the bar council was lawfully holding a forum in its own premises and on the other was a mob hurling racial abuses which were seditious and unlawful
3336376 the rakyat will also wonder why the police force which have proven so effective in dispersing demonstrations of over 10 000 people before were this time unable to contain a 300 strong mob
3336377 the rakyat will certainly expect to see arrests and prosecutions being made against those involved in this protest
3336378 we have read with interest that the mca leadership has come out strongly via statements to the media the party was
3336379 the prime minister the deputy prime minister and other top leaders from umno has been unapologetic and even threatening in their condemnation of the forum conducted by the bar council
3336380 therefore while we welcome mcas views on the controversy they must face up to their responsibility to challenge the views of the prime minister and umno who are clearly abusing the race and religious card recklessly to create an atmosphere of fear
3336381 it is noteworthy that while the protesters were condemned no comments were forthcoming on the opposing views espoused by the umno leaders

3336386 i think des along with eddie ockenden fergus kavanagh and david guest those players with less experience are really standing up at beijing

3336391 kurzfristig sehen wir aufgrund der zunehmenden geopolitischen spannungen weiterhin potenzial f r eine gegenbewegung bis auf 120 je barrel wir sind der meinung dass der markt das risiko von angebotsunterbrechungen aufgrund des kaukasus konflikts untersch tzt
3336392 nat rlich gibt es das risiko dass wirbelst rme und politische unruhen den lpreis wieder treiben k nnten doch saudi arabien hat wieder die rolle des ausgleichenden produzenten bernommen zudem scheint auch in asiatischen volkswirtschaften der wendepunkt bei der nachfrage erreicht

3336404 how are we going to get people who operate in this area to come to this area and stay in this area
3336405 are we putting this in as a line budget in the future
3336406 we have already had some conversations with senator michael nozzolio who has committed some money
3336407 we have had some development in the past 10 years
3336408 we have decided to work together because it is the right thing to do to move the community forward

3336413 as kids we could run in one house in the front door and go out the back door with a sweet potato pie the community was a village raising all the kids
3336414 so i thought if the kids could somehow approach their new neighbors
3336415 and let the neighbors know they were actually interested in them the kids and the neighbors could meet one another its all about building community
3336416 when you say hi to people it takes you out of your comfort zone
3336417 when we first drove out here we were told we should organize the three democrats out here and make sure we get all three of them
3336418 but as weve come here weve noticed there are a lot of republicans who want permission to vote for obama and a lot of people who are very upset with the way the countrys going
3336419 the strength of this they know who they are they know what the local issues are they know the local things going on so they can speak to their fellow voters and also in a sense be almost character witnesses for sen obama and build support that way
3336420 i think they read too much into the state turning blue
3336421 what you have is some changing demographics but most of it is just the republican brand name being in the trash can enabling wide awake democrats to take advantage of that and in virginia theyve done that
3336422 weve got people coming in the door as they are today weve got headquarters all over the state folks knocking on doors we dont have enough bumper stickers we cant keep them in stock
3336423 thats a good indicator a good grassroots indicator things look good in virginia
3336424 we usually think of a down ticket effect when we talk about coattails but mark warners advantages over jim gilmore are so huge that we could see the reverse coattails effect where the senate candidate is actually lifting up the presidential nominee on the ballot at the same time
3336425 a couple of years ago the afghan government wanted to develop a ranger like or a special operations like structure in the military
3336426 the ana were large and laborious the ana is a good army its a developing army but they need a smaller more agile flexible force and so the commandos were the solution
3336427 signal is probably one of the most difficult things to teach the afghan recruits and a lot of it goes back to previous education
3336428 its difficult to explain the background of how a radio works so we try to cut a lot of theory out of it and just take it to practical application this is how it works and this is how you should make it work
3336429 guys come in and you got lumps of clay they really dont know a lot about training and light infantry tactics
3336430 its kind of you tear them down and build them up again its the same thing theres a lot of similarities between what we experience in ranger school in the united states and what theyre experiencing here in commando school
3336431 we issue them uniforms boots helmets weapons vehicles radios everything that theyre going to need
3336432 all of this stuff here will all redeploy with them when they go
3336433 you cant expect them to do the job we want them to do without having the right tools
3336434 i want to change the old policy ill go to america ill learn special training and come back here where i will teach my junior officers in the future
3336435 it will help change my country my army everything will be better
3336436 commando forces are like we say the jewel of the army
3336437 its precious forces for the afghan national army we have the best training we have the best equipment and we can conduct dangerous missions
3336438 id say the best way to describe them is theyre steadfast in their improvement theyre dedicated we really do see them as afghani patriots and i think the way ahead is pretty bright their heart is in the right place
3336439 we are doing operations in four different provinces around here
3336440 as soon as we get word that were needed we can get ready in 20 to 25 minutes and can stop any kind of bad activities
3336441 and i think thats why the commandos are so important
3336442 they are afghans they understand the country they understand the history they can interact with the population in a way that no outsider ever could
3336443 we may hide it in a wall or something in our own home back in the united states
3336444 the afghans know they wouldnt hide it in their house theyd keep it away because wed find it in their house so they understand the customs the way people actually do things and it assists us in our planning
3336445 insurgency and counter insurgency is an intimate struggle in the nation and ultimately it has to be an afghan fight
3336446 you need to feed them you need to resupply them you need to give them equipment you need to give them mobility cars trucks helicopters

3336546 recent escalation in military engagement between russia and georgia poses a threat to certain key oil and gas pipelines which transit georgia
3336547 there have been no deliberate attempts to damage that pipeline
3336548 we think it any attack would be counter active even though it can happen in a conflict
3336549 demonstrate that it is a volatile region it is a crucial region for getting caspian oil to consumer markets
3336550 with negligible domestic oil production unlike some of its caspian neighbours georgias significance to global oil and gas markets is as a transit corridor
3336551 threat of an attack on the btc baku tblisi ceyhan pipeline poses the bigger risk to oil markets it is clear that more generally georgia is a key energy transit hub in the caucasus region and a country of significant strategic importance to energy markets
3336552 the outage on the btc pipeline and recent hostilities in the caucasus highlight the potentially precarious nature of pipeline energy supplies in the region
3336553 with the btc currently closed disruption to georgian energy infrastructure further limits the possibility of getting caspian oil and gas to markets
3336554 renewed flows through georgia expected from september could be further delayed if the line is damaged during the russia georgia conflict
3336555 along the same corridor runs the south caucasus gas pipeline a branch of this pipeline continues through to the russian port of tuapse transiting the region of abkhazia another georgian area affected by separatist action where russian troops are reportedly also being mobilised
3336556 total products leaving georgian ports typically average 50 000 70 000 barrels per day
3336557 latest reports suggest that oil exports from poti have ceased while only partial operations are currently possible from supsa and batumi
3336558 it is a lovely story and you have cheered me up on a miserable day
3336559 i was on a bus and saw this gnome in the garden i think it was fate i mentally tagged it and went back the night before i left and liberated it sometime before midnight
3336560 i felt a degree of guilt as it could have been a treasured heirloom it is not something i am proud of i produced the album because i felt i owed it my best i wanted them to have the best photographs
3336561 the gnome was a great icebreaker on the trip it made friends with a lot of people it was difficult getting it through customs every time it appeared on the scanner they demanded to see it
3336562 but i have warned simon not to do it again
3336563 theres more to life than watching daily commuter traffic and allowing passing cats to urinate on you
3336564 the leprechaun went missing many many months ago and i had forgotten about it
3336565 then i opened the door on thursday and saw he was back it was such a shock
3336566 i thought well its a bit of mischief but at least he hasnt been put through the window
3336567 murphy was quite badly damaged and there was a tightly wrapped parcel next to him my curiosity eventually overcame my alarm because i did wonder if it might explode
3336568 then i saw it was a beautifully bound photo album and opened it up
3336569 his feet were missing but thats no real surprise given that he was sent abseiling down a mountain
3336570 it was the strangest gift i have ever received i just keep thinking how funny it is it makes me smile to see all the people he met on his travels it was a wonderful surprise
3336571 hello first of all i feel i should explain my prolonged absence a gnomes life is full of time for reflection and whilst surveying your garden one summer morning i began to get itchy feet
3336572 i came to the conclusion that the world is a big place and there is more to life than watching the daily commuter traffic and allowing passing cats to urinate on you
3336573 so i decided to free myself from the doldrums of the shire and seek adventure my travels have taken me across three continents 12 countries and more time zones than i can possibly remember
3336574 there have been high points low points and positively terrifying points but i have survived small thanks to the companion with whom i have shared all these moments
3336575 said hello to the big man and he seemed a decent enough bloke but unfortunately i didnt have my camera with me

3336579 if you cant get a decent placement for your surround speakers just dont use them at all
3336580 if you cant put them in a reasonable position which isnt that hard just dont install them because otherwise theyre either not going to do much or even make things worse
3336581 what youre trying to do with surround speakers is to set up a soundfield that comes as close as possible to the soundfield that the mastering engineer used in the studio when he mastered the movies soundtrack and his speakers are behind him 110 degrees off of axis because thats whats prescribed by the audio engineering society theyre not above him theyre not below him and theyre not right beside him theyre not sitting on the wall above the couch with the couch shoved against the wall

3336611 my husband went to all hospitals looking for me although they came by the bed of the hospital mp shah hospital nairobi they couldnt recognise me because i was disfigured
3336612 not until my husband was shown the clothes i wore that he knew i was the one he collapsed
3336613 part of my spleen was removed and a bit of the liver and intestines partially cut off
3336614 it became difficult for hospitals to remove the mass of internal fluids within me

3336623 we have a weapon that has been proven to be effective we cannot afford to ignore it
3336624 we are dealing with both a cultural and medical matter and i urge the elders to allow culture to adapt to science
3336625 world trade organisation talks which collapsed last month over a proposal to help poor farmers cope with a surge in imports
3336626 the issue reflected a deep political divide new zealands wto ambassador crawford falconer who chairs negotiations on agriculture said in a report to the wtos 153 members on last months meeting of ministers
3336627 the discussion over the proposed special safeguard mechanism which would enable developing countries to raise tariffs to counter a flood in imports could not be dismissed as merely a technical issue falconer said
3336628 if we want to fix this in something less than a three year time horizon which i hope we want to do it has to be done in the very near term falconer said in the report
3336629 each day that passes takes us further and further away from the preparedness to compromise that was certainly evident in that last week of july for much of the time
3336630 falconer said the way to crack the deadlock was through intensive work by senior officials and he was willing to organise such negotiations in the coming weeks
3336631 besides the special safeguard mechanism falconer warned there were still a number of potential deal breakers which had to be tackled
3336632 but he said the state of negotiations last month reflected inconceivable progress compared with a year earlier with the basis for a deal on many of the agriculture issues
3336633 negotiations on the doha round of the world trade organization talks can be still be concluded by the december deadline wto director general pascal lamy said tuesday
3336634 the good news is that there still is a possibility to move this round forward and conclude the negotiations within the end 2008 timeframe which all wto members agreed upon last year lamy said at a seminar on the wto
3336635 for soybeans 88 of the crop is blooming compared to 78 last week and 94 both a year ago and on the five year average as with corn planting got off to a late start and there was damage to the crop in june but good weather for most of july and august has at least helped the early stages of development catch up
3336636 corn tasseled in iowa is 96 percent behind the five year average of 100 percent corn silked is 87 percent which is 13 days behind last year and 11 days behind the five year average the the iowa crops and weather report said
3336637 corn condition rated 2 percent very poor 7 percent poor 25 percent fair 49 percent good and 17 percent excellent and soybean condition rated 2 percent very poor 7 percent poor 26 percent fair 48 percent good and 17 percent excellent the report said
3336638 corn and soybean crops in the u s the worlds largest producer
3336639 the u s agriculture department surveyed 9 000 farmers in iowa illinois and missouri last month after flood waters receded as part of a monthly crop report slated for release today the usda probably will forecast a corn harvest of
3336640 the floods sent crop prices surging with corn more than doubling from a year earlier to
3336641 given the relatively late development of 2008 row crops yield estimations still arent much more certain than they were last month and the focus of the august usda crop production and supply and demand reports to be released tuesday morning could fall on acreage and demand observations
3336642 grain prices finished mixed monday in trading made erratic by speculative buying ahead of tuesdays crop report from the u s department of agriculture
3336643 wheat and soybean prices jumped but corn finished lower dragged down by a selloff in crude oil prices because corn is the main ingredient in ethanol its price is often affected by the energy markets
3336644 what happened today doesnt really matter vic lespinasse a grains trader and analyst added saying that on tuesday the main thrust of the market will be dictated by what the usda reports
3336645 the usdas august report is expected to be an important one as it will provide the most accurate reading yet on how much the midwests spring storms damaged the nations crops
3336646 light sweet crude for september delivery dipped 75 cents to settle at 114 45 a barrel on the new york mercantile exchange its lowest close since may 1 when front month crude finished at 112 52
3336647 southern sugar farmers struggling with rising fuel and production costs say the federal governments decision to allow more foreign sugar into the united states to ensure adequate supplies is premature and could depress their prices
3336648 the nations top cane producing states are in the middle of hurricane season with the verdict still out on dollys toll on texas crop a georgia refinery remains idled after an explosion this year leaving the industry operating analysts say at near capacity
3336649 but some trade groups and southern farmers dispute usdas assertion that theres a tight refined sugar market and question the governments getting involved before their harvest even begins
3336650 at what price will corn be so expensive that the federal government will decide that it is time to stop driving up the price of food
3336651 three years ago congress imposed a renewable fuel standard rfs mandate that has forced the gasoline industry to mix massive amounts of corn based ethanol into the nations fuel supply
3336652 but as a safety valve congress gave the environmental protection agency epa the power to waive the new mandates if they turn out to have unforeseen negative consequences
3336653 as we can see now the diversion of our corn supply from grocery stores to gasoline pumps has caused the price of corn to spiral out of control
3336654 this is driving up the cost of staple food items at the grocery store and it is also driving up the price of corn based feed devastating the livestock industry to the point that texas cattle feeders have been operating in the red since 2007
3336655 efforts to cut or freeze u s corn ethanol requirements are unlikely to end with the federal governments denial thursday of texas gov rick perrys plea to waive half of this years mandate
3336656 livestock and food industry groups that backed the request already are talking about increased lobbying efforts in washington to change the law
3336657 legislation under discussion in the senate could freeze ethanol quotas at current levels and at least one governor who supported perrys request is considering a request of his own
3336658 the u s environmental protection agency made the right call last week when it rejected texas gov rick perrys plea to gut the nations renewable fuel standard
3336659 weve got to go with perrys predecessor as texas governor president george w
3336660 the mandate is hardly oppressive nine billion gallons of biofuels a year sounds like a lot until you remember that its only 3 percent of the 300 billion gallons of oil the u s burns every year
3336661 as to the effect on consumer food prices there is obviously some relationship between the price of grain received by farmers and what consumers pay at the supermarket but its far less than food processors would have you believe wheat now sells for about 7 a bushel in eastern colorado a bushel weighs 60 pounds enough to make about 60 loaves of bread that means the wheat farmer got about 12 cents from the loaf of bread that probably cost you 3 everything else goes to middlemen for transportation milling baking labor packaging advertising taxes and profits
3336662 ethanol maker pacific ethanol inc posted a wider than expected second quarter loss as surging corn prices eroded profit margins sending its shares down more than 20 percent
3336663 the net loss including dividends paid out for preferred stock was 10 5 million or 23 cents per share compared with a profit of 1 1 million or 3 cents per share in the year earlier quarter
3336664 net sales rose sharply to 1 02 billion from 169 6 million
3336665 residual linkages with somalia reflected the involvement of al itihaad cells led by aweys and hassan turki in the preparations
3336666 and what did it get us not a damn thing
3336667 it is probably because of my own experience that i had great disagreement with declaring a war on terrorism
3336668 to listen to our testimony and to be held accountable rather than being made into warriors
3336669 i dont see a lot of difference between them and timothy mcveigh
3336670 its not as though the taliban didnt need to be dealt with
3336671 nobody was held accountable for the failure to reinforce an embassy in a city where an al qaeda cell was known to be operating
3336672 people who send civilians to dangerous places should understand the need to provide resources for their security
3336673 ambassadors get a letter from the president of the us outlining their responsibilities and chief among them is security of their people
3336674 money is not ever going to compensate for what happened
3336675 you are so hurt that you want somebody to validate the hurt in some way
3336676 its only money that can validate that hurt but it doesnt mean it will make anyone feel any less hurt
3336677 tried to give victims some sense of validation by at least listening to them
3336678 what makes my story different from other peoples story is that i was both victim and leader in the aftermath of the bombing
3336679 i didnt have the time or luxury to be a victim i had to move immediately into a leadership role
3336680 wir sind zweiter in einer hammergruppe geworden und haben sieben punkte das ist einfach gut darauf m ssen wir aufbauen

3336683 i think everybody felt it was kind of a breakout year for him
3336684 ive heard his name a lot not like somebodys beating my door down but if you look at the reports hes done well
3336685 this seems like a really good opportunity to let him pitch hes been throwing the ball well the idea will be to slow the rangers down a little bit
3336686 i am pleased to be able to contribute to this scheme the residents of the harold and thornville area have had to suffer antisocial behaviour for a long time now and it is about time it stopped hopefully when the bin yards are visible through the railings it will act as a deterrent and the fly tipping and vandalism will stop
3336687 headingley councillors always like to be ahead of the game so it is no surprise to me that we are the first to take advantage of these funds we hope to be able to put the rest towards similarly good works in the near future
3336688 ive decided to finish the operation to force the georgian authorities to peace the safety of our peacekeeping forces and civilian population has been restored
3336689 the aggressor has been punished having sustained considerable losses its armed forces have been disorganised
3336690 should centres of resistance or other aggressive attempts arise you must take the decision to destroy them
3336691 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people
3336692 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3336693 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3336694 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3336695 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3336696 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3336697 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3336698 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3336699 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3336700 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3336701 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3336702 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3336703 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3336704 new kids on the block a behind the music special event
3336705 he definitely can carry a tune he does a great falsetto in the movie and a baritone and alto as well he has a range he plays a range of emotions in the film as well as octaves
3336706 they do their own singing and their own dancing in the film
3336707 you get the opportunity to see both of these guys go for it in a real way thats fun and energetic
3336708 when i went to shake his hand and tell him how much i loved him and what a great job he did he hugged me back and looked me in the eye and said make a great film man
3336709 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3336710 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3336711 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3336712 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3336713 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3336714 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3336715 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3336716 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3336717 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3336718 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3336719 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3336720 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3336721 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3336722 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3336723 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3336724 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3336725 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3336726 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3336727 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3336728 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3336729 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3336730 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3336731 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3336732 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3336733 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3336734 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3336735 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3336736 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3336737 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3336738 the policy of the government is not to ban them but to streamline them to function as responsible community radio stations capable of uniting kenyans through focusing on positive cultures
3336739 tsvangirai is moving goal posts forcing us to negotiate issues which we had already agreed upon
3336740 i dont foresee a total breakdown where there would essentially be war on the streets or at least very high levels of repression and exclusion
3336741 i dont think they talks will remain on the rocks because i think all the parties eventually have no way out of it other than talking to each other
3336742 immediately dismantle all torture camps and bases throughout the country and prosecute those responsible for torture and other mistreatment
3336743 has made it his habit to pull our country out of gridlock
3336744 they thought my father was malleable that they could dictate things to him but my father is a strong and firm man
3336745 i condemn this terrorist attack that targeted us and this is not the first attempt
3336746 is not going to sway us from continuing our course of imposing security through operation good omen
3336747 we must capture or kill the hard core terrorists that are residing now out in the hinterlands
3336748 it was a political statement by the king of jordan that the situation in iraq is stabilizing
3336749 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3336750 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3336751 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3336752 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3336753 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3336754 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3336755 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3336756 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3336757 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3336758 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3336759 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3336760 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3336761 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3336762 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3336763 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3336764 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3336765 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3336766 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3336767 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3336768 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3336769 there doesnt appear to be an independent safety regulation of a standard that common sense would tell you would be acceptable in these cases you would think at minimum an annual inspection would be part of that process
3336770 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3336771 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3336772 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

3336786 bij ieder afscheid valt een traan omdat je iemand moet laten gaan waar je zo aan bent gehecht verdriet dat is een groot gevecht bij ieder afscheid valt een traan al zal dat ooit weer overgaan want die tranen helpen niet bij veel verdriet
3336787 de allerlaatste weken de dagen gingen snel dichtbij komt het afscheid moeilijk wordt het wel
3336788 ik weet dat ik kan schrijven een paar verhaaltjes zijn goed mn achterhuisbeschrijvingen humoristisch veel uit mijn dagboek spreekt maar of ik werkelijk talent heb dat staat nog te bezien
3336789 verzaak nooit aan het schrijven waag het niet het schrijven uit uw leven te bannen ga steeds op pad vergezeld van pen en papier laat een wit blad uw ergste vijand zijn en een inktregel uw grootste vriend
3336790 omhooggevallen troela waarom moest mademoiselle mij per se n school een preek geven

3336797 we have been hoping that cisco would merge the two channel partner programs into a unified smb partner program that would span products services and support
3336798 a single cisco relationship will definitely mitigate challenges and simplify how we do business with our channel partner community quite simply the whole is more than the sum of the parts for cisco and linksys
3336799 the smb market continues to present tremendous growth potential for cisco and our channel partners and we have been successfully serving the sector with solutions from both cisco and linksys

3336801 the integration of quovas powerful geolocation service into the brightcove platform has provided our customers with unparalleled choice and control over their online video distribution strategies
3336802 when japans television broadcasters chose brightcove for their exclusive online video portal for the beijing games quova proved to be an invaluable partner enabling our customers in japan to meet very strict geographic requirements and launch a successful advertising supported web property
3336803 quovas professional expertise and consulting services were of tremendous value to both rainet and labone quova proved capable of delivering the absolute accuracy and quality we needed and implemented the necessary technology in the few weeks we had available
3336804 broadcasting is one of the many industries that have become very tightly regulated as the internet has blossomed over the last ten years
3336805 by using quova data to significantly increase visibility of a customers location broadcasters open up an entirely new channel of delivery but this can only be achieved whilst sitting inside the guidelines provided by content rights holders as more of our customers enter rights management negotiations we have seen an increase in requests for ip data that can meet the accuracy and availability that is being demanded of them the summer games in beijing represent a massive opportunity for our customers and were proud to be an important part of their solution

3336808 we have been hoping that cisco would merge the two channel partner programs into a unified smb partner program that would span products services and support
3336809 a single cisco relationship will definitely mitigate challenges and simplify how we do business with our channel partner community quite simply the whole is more than the sum of the parts for cisco and linksys

3336812 our province is going through an amazing period of rapid expansion and growth and the time is now to invest in the infrastructure that is so crucial to sustaining saskatchewans current economic momentum
3336813 pueda verse en catalu a y normalizar y legalizar una situaci n que no era la correcta en relaci n a las emisiones de tv3 en la comunidad
3336814 estamos en la mejor senda para que en las pr ximas semanas ambas comunidades aut nomas puedan ver la emisiones de las televisiones p blicas de la otra comunidad
3336815 con la finalidad de ir avanzando en normalizar la emisi n de canal 9 en catalu a algo que nunca hab a ocurrido
3336816 conseguimos por parte del ministerio de industria que diera a la comunidad valenciana cuatro nuevos canales de televisi n sumados a los cuatro que ya ten amos antes
3336817 ahora estamos a la espera de conseguir otros cuatro canales m s que est n a punto de aprobarse por parte del ministerio de industria los cuales se destinar n a televisiones p blicas de comunidades lim trofes
3336818 mientras esto se produce ped al conseller de catalu a que hicieran un esfuerzo y que ya se pudiera emitir canal 9 en catalu a lo que est empezando a producirse desde ayer y ya se puede ver en gran parte de catalu a
3336819 ocha is extremely concerned by the escalation and the violence the situation is deteriorating on the ground amidst a significant movement of population
3336820 thats why ocha is asking all parties to give humanitarian organisations access to people who are wounded to people who need aid
3336821 both sides blame each other for continuing hostilities in south ossetia preventing people from leaving the region
3336822 it no longer makes sense for people to work years at a job they may hate in order to amass a fortune before retiring and living the next 30 plus years of their lives feeling bored irrelevant and out of the mainstream
3336823 it is time to stop compartmentalizing work into the first part of our lives and leisure into the last part instead with the appropriate financial planning and the right change in attitude americans can begin living the lives they really want now not later and for those of us who simply cant afford to retire in the traditional sense its time to rethink how we approach the rest of our lives we can either sit back and give up or realize that we have the opportunity to reshape our futures
3336824 i look across the beautiful mountain smiling with me which makes me believe that everything is fine at least for now and thats good enough for me
3336825 it is important for todays students to be able to put the exciting events of their times into historical context
3336826 our fall series of history and the headlines will allow history teachers to help students use past political events and conflicts to think critically about the events that are unfolding today
3336827 history and the headlines african americans in world war ii
3336828 encyclopedia of world war ii a political social and military history
3336829 history and the headlines arab israeli wars 60 years of conflict
3336830 encyclopedia of the arab israeli conflict a political social and military history
3336831 do arabs or jews have a historical right to the land known as palestine
3336832 there are very few people driving to this festival its a huge mass transit event and i think that alone must save a tremendous amount of fuel and help from an emissions standpoint
3336833 i think its great how transportation by ferry is being so encouraged
3336834 and they made it really hard to get parking passes so that keeps it green
3336835 the line was so long i was like what is this
3336836 that takes a lot of extra effort and extra money but the artists were very conscious about not throwing stuff away
3336837 were not adding tons of plastic and paper plates backstage but its a small thing and theres probably a ways to go there
3336838 my girlfriend drives a hybrid and i quit turning my lights on when i go to the restroom
3336839 these artists are out there not to beat people over the head but to increase awareness of a lot of different issues
3336840 in a pretty easy way it creates a little consciousness about what happens when you throw it away
3336841 lets pick it all up lets get a little reward for doing so and it will also keep the grounds looking a lot nicer for everyone throughout the weekend
3336842 i want this to end when im on top so im planning my final show on december 21 2012 its when the mayan calendar ends its the day when solids become liquids and liquids become plasmas
3336843 so im building up to that weve got four years so maybe theres going to be a couple other small releases in the works the album just came out so i have no plans for another release but im constantly starting to work on new stuff just for the live shows
3336844 i used to play very short sets and now i kinda play a standard 45 minute to one hour set so i think i wanna do a 24 hour set and i want it to be a stage production but one where the lines become blurry between reality and complete stage me i want it to be an endurance test and i want it to be miserable and equally fantastic i want the best of both worlds
3336845 i think in too many shows people are too aimed at pleasing the audience if you want to do a really great show which i havent fully done yet you have to really make it bad for them for like 20 hours and then you can kill it for four hours and everyone will be really excited i think people ignore the dynamics of how you can work with an audience
3336846 the lord of the rings the return of the king
3336847 the most disappointing thing the most incredible thing is that nobody caught it
3336848 we will continue to be vocal about the destructive effect of this film we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population
3336849 its sort of edgy territory but we felt that as long as the focus was on the actors who were trying to do something to be taken seriously thats going too far or wrong that was where the humor would come from
3336850 the joke is on actors reaching for roles in terms of hopefully winning awards
3336851 some people have taken this as making fun of handicapped people but were really trying to make fun of the actors who use this material as fodder for acclaim
3336852 the last thing you want is for people to think youre making fun of the victims in this who are having their lives turned into fodder for people to win oscars
3336853 movies about the mentally retarded is something we talked about for a long time my grandfather was adopted by a mentally retarded man a man who shouldnt have been allowed to adopt a kid
3336854 when he saw forrest gump you never saw a guy angrier than him it was not such a picnic to be raised by that guy
3336855 the film is in no way meant to disparage or harm the image of individuals with disabilities we have had productive discussions with representatives of disability advocacy organizations and look forward to working with them closely in the future
3336856 however no changes or cuts to the film will be made
3336857 earlier this year because of a routing quirk we accepted a fill in date at a little old theater in knoxville
3336858 that experience reminded us of our roots both in terms of a stripped down gut bucket musical approach and the direct connection with the people who came to see us
3336859 we just inked a deal with rick rubin that will be announced shortly
3336860 and im sure hes got plans to make way to drag us off the touring trail back into the studio which will be a nice excursion
3336861 the biggest difference with this record is we made it sound more like we do live so its not as much of a shock when people hear us
3336862 live we are loud and have a lot of energy but our records tend to have a reclusive softer sound
3336863 my love came back from sweden brought me some bathroom reading and the pages turn look what weve learned i hope we never reach the end
3336864 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at his wife rhonda
3336865 she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her she smiled at him and told him dont leave me he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired
3336866 i think he will always be remembered as one of the original kings of comedy
3336867 i think what made him so special to people was that even though he was a celebrity he just seemed so down to earth and so much like a part of your family
3336868 he was a hard man and he made no apologies for that
3336869 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
3336870 he represented a kind of hood attitude and cultural phenomenon that was under exploited in america but had great potential
3336871 he was always honest and that honesty was what he exuded and what made him so great
3336872 its a terrible loss i mean you need funny in your life at all times he was definitely one who brought it one of the best comedians ive ever really experienced and condolences go out to everyone in his family
3336873 bernie is just ridiculous with it or he was so god bless his family god bless his soul but bernie was that dude for real so rest in peace man
3336874 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hard core family man my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
3336875 one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have
3336876 losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
3336877 he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather
3336878 i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally co starred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement
3336879 a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the kings of comedy tour bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives
3336880 his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set
3336881 bernie mac was the personification of the word real he kept it real
3336882 that kind of genuine spirit that he carried all time cannot be easily duplicated but i will do my very best to try
3336883 it seemed so weird last time we spoke you admitted to a lifelong fear of condiments i dont want to get you upset
3336884 i lost my mama i went through so much drama i went through so much drama im for obama
3336885 its not a black or white thing its not a rap or rock and roll thing
3336886 its a good music thing we jam about good things from the heart how can you pick between me and trent reznor
3336887 i hope you had a good time f that the time of your life
3336888 tastes great only 105 yen hellz yeah fat free and calorie free just like the state fair food you eat once a year back home you should try to put it on a stick and deep fry it some day enjoy 140ml
3336889 not like the writers and producers at motown or quincy jones but he was on that level in my opinion
3336890 he gave me my voice he taught me showed me and nurtured my voice he didnt teach me how to sing he taught me how to be a better singer that was isaac
3336891 he didnt have a choreographer he didnt have a show
3336892 isaac would just get up there and sit down and become one with the song he was doing and you would look out and the women would be hanging on every word it made me wish my voice was that deep
3336893 i met isaac hayes when i was on the road with james brown in the 70s
3336894 we played a few festivals together in my later years i got to know the man behind the music he was the first official black man to be known as a real rapper and he had nothing but praise for his queens and women of the world
3336895 hayes was so musically advanced and timeless in his compositions he was loved and appreciated by so many he was an enduring symbol of the struggle of the african american man and was a shining example of soul at its best
3336896 although he was under the weather he was still performing
3336897 he was the man he had the show must go on spirit in his absence he will be remembered through his great music he will forever be in our hearts and souls
3336898 i am deeply saddened by the loss of isaac hayes a true historic world music figure
3336899 isaac hayes was the first african american to win an oscar for a music score but never lost sight of his commitment to his community and the betterment of mankind he was more than an artist he was a trailblazer he was an innovator
3336900 i tried to be as real as i possibly could
3336901 and i keyed in on the character shaft the character himself
3336902 i think the songs out there today when the kids talk about romance i think theyre too blatant they dont leave enough for the imagination
3336903 i like to use metaphors thats right and take it slow and easy and then build its kind of like foreplay you dont want to get there too soon else its all over its like eating candy just gobbling it down and then i want some more and its gone you have to savor it
3336904 for them to give us the prius for north america thats a big vote of confidence
3336905 i dont think anybody in this country knew gas prices would rise this fast
3336906 one year after we signed the papers were building camrys in the subaru plant
3336907 we give the customer what they want a lot of choices and you dont add that complexity to the team member on the assembly line

3336916 we are pleased to see continued international demand for clean diesels technologies and solutions as compliance requirements become increasingly stringent worldwide and low emission zones lezs are enacted in major cities in london we have seen exceptional pickup for our technologies in light of the lez furthermore our recent licensing agreement with hilite international inc is clear evidence we have been aggressively working to expand our global market position through strategic partners we have also been pursuing additional verification and approvals of our oem and retrofit applications such as the recent approval of our technologies to supply the scottish government emissions reduction register program additionally we have been enhancing our global sales organization with the appointment of key personnel to support our anticipated growth as well as a number of new initiatives on the marketing front including the launch of our new corporate website www cdti com
3336917 our strategic license agreement with hilite international a leading supplier of automotive powertrain components represents an important new distribution partner with deep penetration into the heavy medium and light duty commercial vehicle and passenger car markets the license enables hilite to utilize our aris airless injection technology and the patented combination of selective catalytic reduction scr with exhaust gas recirculation egr to reduce oxides of nitrogen nox emissions and to optimize fuel economy this agreement comes on the heels of our agreements with bosch and tenneco and provides further validation of our global licensing strategy and intellectual property strength
3336918 we have experienced strong product sales and revenue growth directly related to londons lez legislation the most recent compliance deadline for vehicles greater than 3 5 metric tons occurred in july 2008 and clean diesel is now one of the leading suppliers of emission control technologies for the london lez although direct product sales are more capital intensive than licensing our technology our strategic decision to obtain certification and supply product for the lez program has proven an effective means of seeding the market as evidenced by the credibility we have gained both in europe and globally we believe this strategy has opened the door to additional markets for the technology as we pursue our longer term strategy of licensing the technology through our global distribution partners this licensing strategy will help reduce our costs considerably in the next 18 months
3336919 with over 63 million diesel engines on the road today and over 11 million new engines going into service annually diesel will continue to play an important role in on road as well as off road markets moreover we believe that clean diesel will support and enhance that growth through our fuel efficient emission reduction technology
3336920 wir freuen uns ber die steigende nachfrage nach clean diesels technologien und l sungen als folge der weltweit immer strengeren vorschriften und deren einhaltung sowie der zunehmenden einf hrung von umweltzonen in gr eren st dten in london haben wir gerade im hinblick auf dessen umweltzone eine au ergew hnliche akzeptanz unserer technologien festgestellt dar ber hinaus belegt unser j ngstes lizenzabkommen mit hilite international inc wie stark wir an dem ausbau unserer weltweiten marktposition mit hilfe strategischer partnerschaften gearbeitet haben zudem haben wir unsere aktivit ten auf weitere nachweise und zulassungen f r unsere oem und nachr st applikationen ausgerichtet wie beispielsweise auf die zulassung unserer technologie zur unterst tzung des schadstoffreduktionsprogramms der schottischen regierung zur unterst tzung unseres beschleunigten wachstums haben wir mit der besetzung von schl sselpositionen unsere weltweite vertriebsorganisation gest rkt sowie eine reihe von marketingprogrammen einschlie lich der einf hrung unserer neuen unternehmenswebsite www cdti com umgesetzt
3336921 unser strategisches lizenzabkommen mit hilite international einem global player der automobilzulieferindustrie im bereich antriebsstrang und motoren verst rkt unseren weltweiten vertrieb durch einem wichtigen neuen vertriebspartner mit hoher marktdurchdringung bei allen fahrzeugarten von schwer ber kleintransporter bis hin zu pkws auf der grundlage dieses abkommens kann hilite clean diesels druckluftfreie aris einspritztechnologie sowie die patentierte kombination aus selektiver katalytischer reduktion scr und abgas r ckf hrung egr zur reduzierung von stickoxid emissionen und zur energieeffizienz kommerzialisieren die vereinbarung folgt unseren bereits bestehenden kooperationen mit robert bosch und tenneco inc und best tigt einmal mehr den erfolg unserer globalen lizenzstrategie und die st rke unseres patentportfolios
3336922 unsere starken produktverk ufe sowie unser umsatzwachstum haben von der gesetzgebung f r londons umweltzone nachweislich profitiert die j ngsten fristen f r fahrzeuge ber 3 5 t gehen auf die regelung vom juli 2008 zur ck clean diesel ist nun f r londons umweltzone einer der f hrenden anbieter von technologien zur schadstoffreduzierung obwohl direkte produktverk ufe kapitalintensiver sind als die lizenzierung unserer technologien hat sich unsere strategie ausgezahlt zertifizierungen anzustreben und produkte f r londons umweltzone zu liefern war eine nachweislich erfolgreiche strategie zur marktentwicklung dies beweist auch die gestiegene akzeptanz die wir sowohl in europa als auch weltweit erlangt haben unserer meinung nach hat uns diese strategie die t r zu weiteren m rkten ge ffnet wir werden unsere l ngerfristige strategie weiterf hren und demnach unsere technologie mit hilfe unserer weltweiten vertriebspartner lizenzieren durch diese lizenzstrategie wollen wir die vertriebskosten in den n chsten 18 monaten deutlich senken bei ber 63 millionen dieselmotoren die es heute bereits auf den stra en gibt und bei ber elf millionen neuzulassungen j hrlich wird der kraftstoff diesel auch weiterhin eine wichtige rolle im onroad und offroad markt behaupten mehr noch wir glauben dass clean diesel durch seine kraftstoffsparenden technologien und l sungen zur schadstoffreduzierung das wachstum des kraftstoff diesel unterst tzen und sogar f rdern wird

3336935 for the last three or four summers weve been going over to europe and doing all the festivals and it looks like we just totally ignored our fans in america but thats not the case as a consequence the american fans miss us and they want their metallica so this will be a good homecoming for them and us
3336936 we were talking to lars and he goes were going to take you guys on tour
3336937 im racing unless my leg breaks down the aim has always been to start the race
3336938 everyday i go out and plan to start the race
3336939 the whole thing has been a race against time and a nightmare from when it was diagnosed
3336940 im getting more and more confident because every day you run more on it and it gets stronger
3336941 i feel good i feel happier even to be at this stage its impossible to judge shape
3336942 the window of opportunity for us to accelerate orion for a 2013 flight has closed

3336946 a rate cut within the next couple of months looks well off the agenda
3336947 if they raise prices they may see demand drop or they can opt for a higher market share with no price hikes which only large corporations can survive they are in trouble either way
3336948 profit margins are getting slimmer for companies in sectors such as electrical machinery or automobiles as consumer spending is weak
3336949 i just wanted to be out on my own which i had done by the 100 metres mark that was my goal
3336950 i was out in open water and i was out of the middle which makes it difficult for the other guys to see me
3336951 to set the record straight the council of the university duly approved all the increases including revised car allowances where applicable to staff members falling outside the bargaining unit at unam statements insinuating that there was anything irregular about the said car allowances are untrue and as such are vehemently rejected with great disappointment
3336952 the university wishes to function properly as an institution of higher learning and urges all members of the university community to respect the rule of law and refrain from perpetuating misleading unfounded and untrue information regarding the university
3336953 if the council doesnt come and explain the situation to the staff we will register a dispute of interest

3336960 id rather go into the race healthy and a little bit under prepared than in the shape i was in 2004 but just not healthy and not well enough to endure the race
3336961 ill be the freshest on the start line for sure and i think ill probably be one of the happiest to be there because there have been those points when i really didnt think i would make it
3336962 the only reason i wouldnt be able to finish would be if my leg couldnt handle it but ive been encouraged by what its handled coming out here

3336998 before the event started i told the organizers we need to find time to educate the women of ramadi
3336999 that will only fix their problems for a month or two instead we have to teach them how to make their own money with more educated and trained women the standard of living in ramadi will continue to increase

3337020 for us to accomplish that mission we needed to shed a lot of extra baggage
3337021 we needed to focus a little more we needed to make quicker decisions we needed to be ok saying no to certain stuff and we needed to weed through stuff quicker
3337022 one of the coolest things was rick actually suggested that we all stand up and rock out like we would live
3337023 and we did and it put a lot of life into the basic tracking of it all it was almost to the point where when i was retracking stuff i was standing up headbanging id never done that in a recording situation before hes a great song doctor and he has great ears
3337024 the great thing about working with rick is hes never around
3337025 i would say thats a very strong point in that it leaves the four of us to take on the entire brunt of the work and the planning that goes into the songwriting process and the recording process
3337026 bob would add a lot of his own musical input and with that came a lot of his own influences and style and jurisdiction and idiosyncrasies
3337027 and it would eventually make it into our sound but with rick because he wasnt there its almost 100 percent undiluted metallica hed come in and say thats good that isnt change that and we would have to figure that out for ourselves this is the most pure weve sounded in a long time
3337028 rick is not the kind of producer like a bob rock whos there every moment holding your hand making you step up
3337029 rock arranged everything all the time and wore many hats in the studio rick rubin no hat rick comes in and goes well wheres the songs ok thats good thats not so good more of this less of that see you in a few months goodbye and thats what we needed that brutal honesty to get through it and it worked
3337030 the slipknot that he did the system of a down records he did and even the johnny cash stuff where its the essence of him and you hear him you hear whats going on thats what i want i want people to really hear metallica
3337031 so in a way its got somewhat of an older sound songs and arrangement wise weve got a lot more diversity on the record instrumentals fast shorter songs epic ballady moments its quite different from st anger where if youre angry this is your album and if youre not it might take some work
3337032 it appears that for people who have a certain genetic makeup the initial physical reaction to smoking can play a significant role in determining what happens next
3337033 if cigarette smoking is sustained nicotine addiction can occur in a few days to a few months
3337034 the finding of a genetic association with pleasurable early smoking experiences may help explain how people get addicted and of course once addicted many will keep smoking for the rest of their lives
3337035 understanding the genetics of complex disorders such as nicotine addiction will require much more research on key traits
3337036 over the next several months the jamaica pre mix and lafarge teams will structure the operations accordingly to produce the same high quality products and services that our customers expect
3337037 we see it as an opportunity to expand our operations and markets
3337038 with a company like lafarge it is really a good opportunity for us
3337039 the mining company is mishandling explosives the person doing this is not certified and illiterate and also he is assisted by illegal mexicans
3337040 its hard to explain how you have three fatalities in less than a year without there being a problem with safety programs
3337041 if the mine has had problems in the past you also have to wonder why elevated enforcement action didnt kick in
3337042 you have to be very careful or youll have falls its a risky kind of thing that has to be checked out daily
3337043 i just couldnt put our people through any more of this
3337044 we never thought anything like this could happen to us once let alone three times
3337045 with this number of violations it was obvious that there had been no examination of ground conditions in some time without a proper examination of ground conditions and removal of loose ground serious injury to persons could be expected if an accident was to occur
3337046 we may not have read an edict to them but everybody knew what they were supposed to be doing
3337047 neither of the men in the ground fall incidents were doing anything wrong
3337048 for now we have ceased operations until we can determine if we can operate the mine safely
3337049 this has been very hard im just taking things day to day right now
3337050 i told him that dad got really hurt at work and wont be coming back to us that hed be a star in the sky
3337051 these highly trained and highly skilled miners and staff honestly thought they could get through the ground with little or no problem this time they were wrong
3337052 this has been life changing for every single person who works there
3337053 anybody you ask would say my husband wouldnt put himself in a situation he didnt think was safe
3337054 miners go in every day and look and every day conditions change yes we knew the ground was bad but what happened was out of their hands
3337055 you go underground every day and you dont know if youre coming out
3337056 were all at risk in one way or another you just have to try and look out for yourself and the guy next to you
3337057 all of us in some way are attached to the mine when somebodys killed it affects all of us
3337058 the city of schofield is in a unique position one that we may never again find ourselves in
3337059 wed love to have the opportunity for potential growth in that area
3337060 its an area thats largely residential and i think that combined with the fact we have more than 1 800 campers in the summer its not a good use for that location
3337061 just look at that site and ask yourself if thats compatible with a residential neighborhood and camp sturtevant

3337082 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3337083 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3337084 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3337085 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3337086 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3337087 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3337088 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3337089 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3337090 it was definitely difficult because last night was a finals situation
3337091 i really didnt have the focus i did yesterday i was just looking to get out of my heat ive got more races ahead of me that are more important
3337092 i think emotionally it probably did take a little bit out of me but ive been very careful about what ive been doing and reacting to that
3337093 just play it down and enjoy the moment and focus on the days ahead thats why i was trying to hold back a little bit so i didnt blow my tank and i can swim fast tomorrow morning
3337094 i was so excited the whole day it was just truly spectacular
3337095 now we need to move on and swim fast theres a lot of fast swimmers i know im capable of doing a lot and thats what i plan on doing
3337096 the chance that five years after the first physics data are taken most particle physicists will agree that the lhc has discovered this particular thing

3337098 exactly what you would expect from the standard model and nothing more
3337099 god 10 20 more likely than stable black holes but still a long shot
3337100 10 20 probability of finding god is less of a probability than a planet killing asteroid hitting the earth in the next second assuming no knowledge of such asteroids and their trajectories just that they hit approximately once every 100 million years on average
3337101 well technically i cant know for i certain i that no god exists but i know that its highly highly unlikely
3337102 well the energy range is too low we never expected to discover anything about higgs dm or de anyway
3337103 i dont have the medicine i dont have the resources

3337107 what we want is to have a society where everyone improves
3337108 i dont think that is quite real life is made of grey tones
3337109 those doctors have had a free education in venezuela so in a way we are subsidising the development of the rich countries
3337110 if we dont have enough freedom and this really begins to be a socialist place like cuba then i will get out of here
3337111 but right now i choose to stay in my country
3337112 if you want money of course its very good to leave the country if you dont if your preferences are about family love friends or whatever maybe you should think about staying
3337113 we made the decision to go with one name so that its a consistent experience for customers

3337134 we attend neighborhood meetings with our community policing officers and ask what the issues are
3337135 by far this is one of the highest complaints residents continually complain about loud music disturbing them at all different hours
3337136 they say they saw the officers standing on the sidewalk or near a front porch but felt the officer was doing something else and never even thought of turning down their music

3337201 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored
3337202 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized

3337204 but thats the craziest thing ive ever heard of anyone doing
3337205 there are a lot of moments of outrageous comedy but its supposed to be something everybody can relate to
3337206 i dont think people have an idea a lot of times especially if youre not from the urban south that there is such a variety of different people here
3337207 if you see a movie set in the south its always kind of the same people
3337208 a lot of the things in the movie are kind of based on people that i knew here like people i worked with family and friends
3337209 what i always wanted to do was do a movie like what midnight in the garden of good and evil did for savannah ga you see all these unique people the beautiful locations and you just want to visit it so i hope people will get a big kick out of it its really a sweet movie

3337239 and i told him thats exactly what this is all about and if nothing else this letter just taught you a life lesson
3337240 well the law prohibits it and the legislature enacted the laws to protect the health safety and welfare of all children
3337241 it seems totally unbelievable that somebody would even go to that extreme to send a letter to somebody let alone looking to find something about child labor laws
3337242 if my doors close and i never open again and this boy becomes successful then i will be the happiest person in the world
3337243 its strange that a kid at this age would glean onto this particular kind of music and show the intensity and kind of the ability to function as kind of 8 year old blues guy

3337247 for the past year this team has provided tireless support throughout the entire contract proposal and is a key reason for the department of energys selection of savannah river nuclear solutions llc to manage and operate the site
3337248 their demonstrated commitment and dedication will chart a successful course as we move into this new business opportunity
3337249 despite the lower revenue the improvement in our earnings from continuing operations is indicative of our ongoing commitment to the implementation of our planned reduction of overall operating expenses and to a lesser extent a more favorable product mix
3337250 although revenue generated by our tools segment has decreased when comparing the three months ended june 30 2008 to 2007 the segment has increased its operating income by approximately 724 000 primarily the result of higher gross margins
3337251 woodmark continues to be the subsidiary most impacted by the housing market collapse woodmarks revenue for the second quarter of 2008 was 5 968 000 down from 8 509 000 reported during the second quarter of 2007
3337252 until the downward trend in the number of new housing starts levels and begins to increase we do not expect to see an improvement in woodmarks revenue
3337253 we are continually evaluating and examining all expenditures and are restructuring our operation in order to ensure that woodmark remains one of the leaders in providing quality stair parts accessories and service to the marketplace
3337254 pacific stairs net revenue for the three month period ended june 30 2008 of 557 000 decreased from 1 031 000 reported for the same period in the prior year this decrease is primarily attributable to a continuing decline in the new home construction market in southern california and arizona nationwide which primarily markets fencing and gate hardware has until this quarter not been materially affected by the sluggish home building sector however we experienced a decrease in net revenue to 4 542 000 for the second quarter of 2008 compared to 5 282 000 reported for the same period in the prior year nationwides net revenue for fencing decreased 237 000 further nationwides oem and patio product lines decreased as well by 281 000 and 222 000 respectively lastly there is continued global pressure on commodity prices which is adversely affecting the cost of most of our shaped metal products such as our gate hardware and iron balusters which in turn will likely negatively impact gross margin on certain product lines going forward
3337255 gross margin in the tools segment increased to 32 9 for the three month period ended june 30 2008 from 26 9 reported for the three months ended june 30 2007 specifically gross margin at florida pneumatic increased to 30 4 for the three month period ended june 30 2008 from 25 3 for the three month period ended june 30 2007 primarily the result of a reduction in the fees paid to an overseas trading partner as well as various cost reductions implemented during the quarter gross margin improved at hy tech to 36 9 for the three months ended june 30 2008 from 31 6 reported for the second quarter of 2007 the increases reported in this quarter are primarily due to cost cutting changes in product mix as well as improved manufacturing efficiencies
3337256 gross margin for the hardware segment which continues to be severely affected by the continuing downturn in the number of new homes constructed was 29 8 for the three month period ended june 30 2008 as compared to 32 6 for the same period in 2007
3337257 while our results from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2008 reflected improvement over the prior year we remain guarded for the remainder of 2008 due to the questionable nature of the housing market as the key to our growth will be the eventual timing of a housing recovery in spite of the current economic environment everyone at p amp f remains dedicated to optimizing our efforts in order to enhance shareholder value
3337258 with respect to our continuing operations we remain very pleased with the performance and prospects for our silipos business in addition we are seeing the effect of expense reductions efforts in our corporate functions which began earlier this year and we continue to actively seek cost reduction opportunities at each of our subsidiaries consistent with our goal of simplifying the company and reducing expenses we believe our langer business remains stable and we are working hard to align the business model at twincraft in light of the raw material cost increases we have experienced
3337259 we are pleased to have completed the dispositions of langer uk regal and bi op on a fairly expeditious basis and at prices which we believe were attractive relative to the performance of these businesses and their prospects our stated goal in undertaking our strategic review was the simplification of our business with an eye toward maximization of value for our shareholders consistent with this goal since the beginning of this year we used some of the proceeds from the dispositions to repurchase 852 639 shares of our outstanding common stock at an average price of 1 50 per share which represents approximately 7 4 percent of our shares outstanding at december 31 2007 in addition in connection with the sale of bi op we have entered into an agreement to repurchase for 60 000 approximately 107 000 shares of langer common stock from the general manager of bi op
3337260 we are continuing to evaluate alternatives and opportunities related to our remaining businesses we have been working with the walden group a strategic health care investment banking firm and are in discussions with a number of parties about the future of our legacy langer custom orthotics business in addition we have retained business development asia llc to advise us on potential strategic alternatives for our silipos business as we have noted this may include a sale of one or more of these businesses provided that such dispositions would meet our criteria we remain committed to continuing our efforts with the goal of maximizing shareholder value and will comment further on these matters at the appropriate time
3337261 israel is following with great concern the developments in south ossetia and abkhazia and hopes the violence will end
3337262 israel recognizes the territorial integrity of georgia and calls for a peaceful solution
3337263 israel should be proud of its military which trained georgian soldiers
3337264 a small group of georgian soldiers were able to wipe out an entire russian military division thanks to the israeli training
3337265 georgian minister tells israel radio thanks to israeli training were fending off russian military
3337266 the fact that georgias defense minister davit kezerashvili is a former israeli who is fluent in hebrew contributed to this cooperation
3337267 internalized israeli military technique and if the special reconnaissance forces have chalked up any successes

3337271 at the moment there is a little bit too much junk on there thats not to denigrate the guys who have stuff there but a way to tier and rate content would be nice
3337272 obviously as were coming to xbox live for the first time it would be nice to be prominent and we could just get lost in the morass of arcade conversions
3337273 but its also the bread and butter for those companies it may not be huge sales but that thousand or so per month they are selling is a trickle of income and its just going to get sliced off
3337274 flat out delisting perhaps isnt the solution its a step in the right direction but hopefully theyll come back and have a facility whereby if its been on xbox live arcade you can always pick it up from somewhere

3337281 two of the people who received these letters are pensioners one had to get her daughter to respond on her behalf they didnt know what to do
3337282 we shouldnt forget that these people are victims of anti social behaviour and we shouldnt be treating them like they are the criminals which unfortunately i feel bury council is
3337283 if people want to have a better quality of life and keep vandalism at bay they must take some responsibility for their communities
3337284 graffiti makes a place look uninviting and attracts anti social behaviour we are happy to re word the letter but we stand by the sentiment

3337291 its touching how american neoconservatives who have no regard for international law when they want to invade some troublesome country have developed a sudden reverence for national sovereignty
3337292 recent escalation in military engagement between russia and georgia poses a threat to certain key oil and gas pipelines which transit georgia
3337293 there have been no deliberate attempts to damage that pipeline
3337294 we think it any attack would be counter active even though it can happen in a conflict
3337295 demonstrate that it is a volatile region it is a crucial region for getting caspian oil to consumer markets
3337296 with negligible domestic oil production unlike some of its caspian neighbours georgias significance to global oil and gas markets is as a transit corridor
3337297 threat of an attack on the btc baku tblisi ceyhan pipeline poses the bigger risk to oil markets it is clear that more generally georgia is a key energy transit hub in the caucasus region and a country of significant strategic importance to energy markets
3337298 the outage on the btc pipeline and recent hostilities in the caucasus highlight the potentially precarious nature of pipeline energy supplies in the region
3337299 with the btc currently closed disruption to georgian energy infrastructure further limits the possibility of getting caspian oil and gas to markets
3337300 renewed flows through georgia expected from september could be further delayed if the line is damaged during the russia georgia conflict
3337301 along the same corridor runs the south caucasus gas pipeline a branch of this pipeline continues through to the russian port of tuapse transiting the region of abkhazia another georgian area affected by separatist action where russian troops are reportedly also being mobilised
3337302 total products leaving georgian ports typically average 50 000 70 000 barrels per day
3337303 latest reports suggest that oil exports from poti have ceased while only partial operations are currently possible from supsa and batumi

3337310 were going to play a significant amount of our starting unit in this game were preparing to play a great game on saturday
3337311 we want to make a good decision the information we are gathering right now is valuable as i have said all along i believe in all three guys it is important and they must be ready anytime a guy gets a rep at least i am feeling good that it is not a wasted rep because they all may have to play
3337312 you know every year in training camp in most cases and on most teams the defense is always ahead of the offense
3337313 it shows in preseason games you see the scores theyre always low and i think thats what you saw in the first game

3337371 its the olympics and im with the team in the village
3337372 theyre not going to give me a tough time because i lost but its nice to make others proud and to win for new zealand
3337373 when you dont its tough but thats how it goes
3337374 it did go through my mind but it wasnt something i dwelt on
3337375 but i was thinking at one stage i had match point this could have been done but it didnt happen
3337376 any loss in the olympics is tough you want to do well in the olympics
3337377 but that might have been the problem maybe she wanted to do well too badly it seemed to me morita wasnt expecting anything and was quite loose
3337378 marina was muscling the ball too much and was not really relaxed
3337379 if its a form slump you lose one and one she hasnt done that what i think is maybe shes creating too much expectation for herself and putting a little too much pressure on herself
3337380 its just one of those things pre match tactics of putting something out there to stir it up its nothing different to what any other team does
3337381 everyones looking for that edge and whatever we are doing they will be doing something as well i would say

3337405 its tricky and easy at the same time for this assignment my class wont have to split their heads trying to form a proper group since there are no other options but to work with one another however its tricky as well because we have no other options but to work with one another its kind of funny if i think about it
3337406 well im going to try to get a part time job hopefully itll help to get my mind off things also i think im going to make more time for my family and friends so i wont feel so pressured to perform distraction is key i guess
3337407 its all about how we handle this task to be honest i really like my newswriting group mates and id like to think that ive fostered a better relationship with them thanks to the major group assignment that weve just submitted but its the pressure of wanting to do really well that gets most of us anxious and stressed out still im hoping for the best

3337410 over the last two weeks how often have you been bothered by the following problem thoughts that you would be better off dead or of hurting yourself in some way
3337411 it is worrying that despite improvements in cancer care a substantial number of patients feel they would be better off dead
3337412 we know that depression is common in patients who have cancer but it is often missed pain is also a big problem treating patients symptoms as well as their disease might improve and even save their lives
3337413 it is normal to experience distress after a cancer diagnosis but for some patients emotional distress or depression becomes a problem in itself and may lead to suicidal thoughts cancer specialists and gps can provide treatment with the help of psychiatrists if necessary

3337417 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored
3337418 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3337419 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3337420 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3337421 i guess the way i would respond to that is we are always going to look at configurations and alignments and structures that will be beneficial to our members needs and to our client major league baseball
3337422 were always going to try to look and see whats in the best interest of both of those parties
3337423 yes were talking about those kinds of processes in those leagues and others
3337424 advised our league that there could be a possibility of movement of two teams because we do have several major league clubs very upset with the facilities with two of our ballclubs
3337425 i dont even know if richmond was taken into the equation or not its not my business thats oconners call
3337426 the classification that we think is best for all of baseball
3337427 then you get a situation where an owner can buy a team and move it there from there its got to be a collaboration between the city and the county owners and to some extent the league too
3337428 well be involved until a certain part then we step back and let the city the county and the owners get involved with negotiating leases or construction projects that type of thing
3337429 everyone involved in this has to be ready to move once the territory is released
3337430 but there are a lot of moving parts you cant script it

3337444 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3337445 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3337446 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle

3337484 the uninsurance rate has fallen by only 2 percent from 7 7 percent to 5 8 percent since the reform was passed while the plan is already 147 million over budget

3337599 what we found is that bad guys just dont stay in one place
3337600 all of us were dealing with them and there was a tremendous need to share information
3337601 it provides secure communications for terrorists and allows them to broadcast their messages from websites to incite others to action
3337602 website monitoring is a key to keeping a handle on the mindsets of terrorist groups and where they might be headed
3337603 these groups often practice what we call leaderless resistance through the internet they post on their websites what they want their followers to do and then encourage them to do it this can even involve posting instructions on how to build an incendiary device the discussions are protected by the first amendment
3337604 in the past these measures counted numbers of arrests or prosecutions
3337605 since 9 11 agencies are injecting measurements like terrorism prevention slowly they are getting new measurements in place like number of intelligence reports filed
3337606 integral to all of this is the number of information sharing networks facilitated by the internet which will continue to play an ever expanding role in the fight against terrorism
3337607 hopelessly addicted so i actually buy more than i sell
3337608 cursed is the ground because of you through painful toil you will eat of it all the days of your life it will produce thorns and thistles for you
3337609 by faith we have been made acceptable to god and now because of our lord jesus christ we live at peace with god christ has also introduced us to gods undeserved kindness on which we take our stand so we are happy as we look forward to sharing in the glory of god but thats not all we gladly suffer because we know that suffering helps us to endure and endurance builds character which gives us a hope
3337610 thou movest us to delight in praising thee for thou hast formed us for thyself and our hearts are restless till they find rest in thee
3337611 if we offer up a sacrifice of praise which i did thanking god for what he has done for who he is for the promises hes made our hearts are lifted up on the praises our weary souls restored by the entry of the spirit i must raise my guard because
3337612 sin is crouching at the door eager to control you but you must subdue it and be its master
3337613 even youths grow tired and weary and young men stumble and fall but those who hope in the lord will renew their strength they will soar on wings like eagles they will run and not grow weary they will walk and not be faint
3337614 doesnt it at least feel good to know that no animal suffered for you to have this meal
3337615 but what would your nutritionist say if he saw what you are eating
3337616 very few local authorities have used their powers to acquire itemised call records in relation to the investigations which they have conducted
3337617 indeed our inspections have shown that generally the local authorities could make much more use of communications data as a powerful tool to investigate crime
3337618 persistently rip off consumers cheat the taxpayer deal in counterfeit goods and prey on the elderly and vulnerable
3337619 generally the powers are being used to respond to residents complaints about fly tippers rogue traders and those defrauding the council tax or housing benefit system
3337620 time and again these are just the type of crimes that residents tell us that they want to see tackled
3337621 without these powers councils would not be able to provide the level of reassurance and protection local people demand and deserve
3337622 it is not right that we charge our police with combating crime and disorder and then tie their hands behind their backs in the name of whitehall bureaucracy
3337623 conservatives believe the police should be given both the resources and the freedom to use those resources to do their job
3337624 with songs like that you know these dudes are all about passion which you can feel pouring off this album like a spinning vinyl out of your speakers while you play it in your basement on your shag carpet

3337640 why dont you come along surely it is time to start
3337641 in discussions with anyone to sell the push to talk network it acquired in the 2005 purchase of nextel communications inc
3337642 sidney ponson gave us yet another efficient start and we squandered it
3337643 plaxico knows how you feel he has to sit too man but dont sweat it those ribs are gonna bother you wayyy more when its time for contract renegotiations
3337644 if youre not looking you may get hit in the head
3337645 lets just say its a good thing wayne chrebet is retired because favre might have killed that scrappy little guy
3337646 saw him getting along quite well with joe torre on several occasions so its probably because he doesnt like black people
3337647 playing against arsenal is never easy but perhaps now is the best time to try and beat them
3337648 still they are very accomplished tactically and their game is full of pace so they remain very dangerous
3337649 i would have preferred a different opponent someone from eastern europe or even germany but the draw is made and we must approach the game full of optimism
3337650 nobody doubts that arsenal are the favourites but that doesnt mean anything
3337651 twente have raised their game to play in the champions league and we are treating it like a party
3337652 we must raise our game for the first match at home and make sure we get a good result so that we are travelling to london with possibilities to progress and not just to be a tourist
3337653 its all paper talk flying about i am happy at sunderland i dont know if other clubs have made enquiries but like i said i am happy here
3337654 i have spoken to the manager and he wants me to stay he wants me around i am staying put unless they sunderland want me out
3337655 the manager is a great guy here and he knows his stuff its onwards and upwards its always good to see top players coming in
3337656 if i was arsene wenger i wouldnt have let diarra go to pompey i would have kept him as we needed strength in midfield
3337657 eduardo and van persie getting injured left us short of numbers up front
3337658 since fredrik is completely without a contract he can go to a club when he wants in the same way as when chelsea signed magnus hedman
3337659 we are trying to bring a striker in on loan to give us added firepower in the short term there is no secret in that and we will continue to work on that today
3337660 whether the club concerned will allow their player to play in the carling cup is a different matter that is a situation we will have to look at
3337661 it would be unwise to continue as we are with no prospect of the other boys returning before the international break by the time they have a weeks training and maybe a reserve game we will be looking at the end of the month
3337662 a cup run is vitally important for this football club ive had fairly decent success in this competition over the last few years and i want to continue that with qpr
3337663 we werent at our best on saturday and there is a lot of room for improvement defensively we werent as good as i know we can be and ill be looking for an improvement on tuesday
3337664 i want to play football i got stuck in a rut at qpr with many players coming in and many players going out i was delighted to come down here to be honest
3337665 i have been training with the reserves and kids at qpr and its not the same standard i had a couple of clubs interested but when plymouth wanted to do it on friday i had no doubt about it i packed my gear in half an hour and jumped in the car
3337666 who are they quoting on a sign placed in a window
3337667 lincoln takes on a high importance for us because we want to use it as a springboard to do things in the league our main focus is the league and nothing will get in the way of that but we need to get a result from somewhere to boost our confidence and boost the confidence of the supporters
3337668 the most important thing to me is turning this team into a winning team whatever the competition and we would like to start with the league cup if you had won on saturday the cup is another game and you might rest a few players if you are looking to the league in our case we lost on saturday and so we need to bounce back pretty quickly it is an important game for us
3337669 i feel good in myself i had a good pre season but i know nothing can be taken for granted come tuesday or come saturday i cmight not be playing we have just got to keep our heads up when called upon
3337670 i can tell you but i have to speak in code here you can use this keyword code card afterwords to figure out the analogy im about to give you
3337671 our money wizards assured our bank executives that this new lending would be like driving a new car and that wed be fashion able everywhere we were even handed a nice clean map unfortunately it seemed like we ended up driving too fast and a crash ensued we looked around and there was nothing but a wreck left in the end my friend i dont want to tell you what our balance and income statements will look like because i respect you too much to bore you with all the details
3337672 its easy to make money in stocks just figure out which ones arent going to go up and dont buy them
3337673 it wont be pretty out there in two to four years
3337674 lo i am with you alway even unto the end of the world
3337675 the power of magick part 2 which is one of the most powerful methods of magickal development in existence another is to listen to the om and iao mantras previously mentioned
3337676 the way of non attachment the practice of insight meditation
3337677 i turned around to my dad and said thats exactly what i want to do
3337678 he goes its not how many times you get knocked down but its how many times you get back up and go forward carl latz said his son told him
3337679 and i told him thats exactly what this is all about and if nothing else this letter just taught you a life lesson
3337680 well the law prohibits it and the legislature enacted the laws to protect the health safety and welfare of all children
3337681 it seems totally unbelievable that somebody would even go to that extreme to send a letter to somebody let alone looking to find something about child labor laws
3337682 if my doors close and i never open again and this boy becomes successful then i will be the happiest person in the world
3337683 its strange that a kid at this age would glean onto this particular kind of music and show the intensity and kind of the ability to function as kind of 8 year old blues guy
3337684 it would be unusual to find an 8 year old who can play joe satriani licks
3337685 ive had more people tell me they say its a kids body but it has a 70 year old dude inside
3337686 i think its so much you can do on the guitar
3337687 because i got more inspiration i got more sadness in me
3337688 snape is a very sadistic teacher loosely based on a teacher i myself had i have to say i think children are very aware and we are kidding ourselves if we dont think that they are that teachers do sometimes abuse their power and this particular teacher does abuse his power hes not a particularly pleasant person at all
3337689 and sometimes i feel like pushing your cholesteral free body out the window
3337690 oh i cant eat this it has too much cholesteral in it
3337691 to always believe in what you can hold in your hands
3337692 it is your choices far more than your abilities that make you who you are
3337693 mijn gedachten gaan uit naar de familie van de heer storimans in het bijzonder zijn vrouw en twee kinderen de regering betuigt hen en rtl haar innige deelneming
3337694 tijdens mijn meest recente bezoek aan afghanistan in mei heb ik uitgebreid met de heer storimans gesproken ik heb hem leren kennen als een hardwerkende professional en een bijzonder sympathieke man
3337695 naar wat wij weten reed jeroen akkermans met zijn cameraman stan storimans 39 in een konvooi in de buurt van gori het konvooi is in de problemen gekomen waarbij stan om het leven kwam en jeroen een scherf in zijn been kreeg aldus habets
3337696 we proberen hem en het lichaam van stan zo snel mogelijk terug te halen twee psychologen gaan mee naar gori om jeroen bij te staan
3337697 we zullen waarschijnlijk wel iets doen maar we overleggen nog hoe we dat inkleden
3337698 hij was een vriendelijke ruige gozer aldus de tv baas over de in goirle woonachtige storimans
3337699 i read that in 3rd grade and i hated it
3337700 come on is that all you got im gonna rip your heads off
3337701 my education was the liberty i had to read indiscriminately and all the time with my eyes hanging out
3337702 humpbacks and southern right whales are making a comeback in much of their range mainly because they have been protected from commercial hunting
3337703 this is a great conservation success and clearly shows what needs to be done to ensure these ocean giants survive
3337704 i think ive been doing it for so long they expect it now
3337705 i got started because i didnt like that with the aids disease people were politicizing a health care issue i wanted to push against that
3337706 since then ive done it because it is such a great community and a great event
3337707 i did a thousand little things it feels like everything i could think of
3337708 its all about doing something i never thought i could do
3337709 ive ridden thousands of miles in the last two years training
3337710 the four days really gave me an opportunity to get to know the people the people affected by hiv and aids
3337711 the love that people showed and expressed within those four days was really amazing the commitment as far as giving their all the sincerity and the loyalty its just so amazing
3337712 i think too many people have forgotten that aids is still with us and there are still new cases of it
3337713 people continue to need support and the public needs to be reminded
3337714 why do you always get to tell the story dude i mean why not let someone else control part of the story just once
3337715 what do you want chip do you want to narrate its not like i signed up for this
3337716 you can tell everyone that bleach opens during the last 60 seconds of 2003 in a bathroom where a girl lay dying and a jaded 30 year old named jeremy who navigates the reader through the endless repulsiveness of the world watches before diving into an explanation of what is going on jeremy doubles back eight days
3337717 i just want what everyone wants to be needed look at the first fifty pages theres barely one mention of me
3337718 blackout is easy who doesnt get that blackout picks up two years after bleach in las vegas where stoner and friends are celebrating his bachelor party complete with strippers and crack cocaine the ride home is blurry and the next morning in los angeles brings a surprise when stoners friends chip and jeremy wake to find police officers and a dead body they are allegedly responsible for the problem neither remember anything from the thai hooker filled night before
3337719 hey dude what did you come over here for anyway
3337720 i got an ounce and was wondering if you wanted to smoke any
3337721 solo adesso vedo quale esercito di angeli custodi mi ha circondato
3337722 saluto tutti i cittadini di bressanone anche io adesso sono un cittadino di bressanone
3337723 come tutte le cose belle questi giorni sono terminati porto con me un tesoro di ricordi
3337724 nei momenti difficili dio ci porge la mano e chiede a noi di porgerla al prossimo nel bisogno
3337725 bressanone per me un luogo di incontri incontro delle culture incontro anche tra una sana laicit ed una gioiosa fede cattolica incontro tra una grande storia e il presente e il futuro
3337726 c un punto nel vangelo di marco dove egli racconta che dopo giorni di stress il signore ha detto ai discepoli
3337727 paolo vi fra lostracismo del clero e quello dei mass media
3337728 una gmg grande i giorni di sydney hanno lasciato un forte segno scialbi i resoconti dei quotidiani italiani
3337729 la storia sta rendendo giustizia perch man mano che il tempo passa pi si comprende la grandezza di questo papa che la provvidenza ha chiamato a servire la chiesa fra due altre grandi figure papa giovanni xxiii e papa giovanni paolo ii
3337730 la grandezza del suo pontificato e limportanza del suo magistero
3337731 delle ansie e delle inquietudini degli uomini e delle donne di oggi
3337732 molti ne ricorderanno la figura esile fragile pure come salute anche se super gli ottantanni ma aveva unintelligenza acutissima e una forza di volont straordinaria era mite molto rispettoso degli altri come indole assomigliava alla mamma piuttosto contemplativo e riflessivo ma nellazione risult a imitazione del padre un testimone coraggioso un giorno a jean guitton disse che alla sua mamma doveva il senso di dio e della preghiera la contemplazione la vita interiore a suo padre invece doveva il coraggio e soprattutto la volont di non arrendersi al male e di testimoniare il bene
3337733 come papa fu anzitutto un uomo di una grande spiritualit ha proseguito il porporato la sua preoccupazione fu sempre quella di scoprire nella preghiera la volont di dio e di attuarla aveva acutissimo il senso di dio di vivere alla sua presenza ed era profondamente convinto che al mondo nessuno esiste per caso o per sbaglio ma tutti esistiamo perch dio ci ha amati e quello che conta diceva realizzare nella propria vita la volont di dio e si comprende questo amore a dio padre se pensiamo che da arcivescovo volle che la missione promossa per dare un risveglio religioso alla citt di milano avesse come tema proprio quello della paternit di dio
3337734 paolo vi ha concluso il cardinale fu un grande dono alla chiesa in quel momento difficile
3337735 incoraggiamento perch questo santuario posto qui in alto in questo luogo mariano dove ci sono anche tanti ricordi del papa paolo vi sia sempre nella societ rumorosa e affaccendata di oggi unoasi di pace e di raccoglimento dove lo spirito pu aprirsi a dio
3337736 ho detto loro ha poi confidato al termine della visita che loro sono nel cuore della chiesa il cuore non si vede in un organismo ma quello che fa funzionare lorganismo facendo circolare il sangue anche le suore di clausura non si vedono ma la loro testimonianza importante ed importante per il bene della chiesa la loro dedizione alla preghiera
3337737 obwohl die anleger wegen der gesamtwirtschaftlichen eintr bung im zuge der finanzkrise derzeit zur ckhaltender und damit nicht mehr so anf llig auf aktien spam geworden sind ist das problem nach wie vor akut und die kuh somit noch l ngst nicht vom eis

3337740 at the time i said any company we have now must be named tipoteh dennis corporation bernard quiah liberia limited
3337741 anything the military did while we were engaged with the peoples redemption council prc we take responsibilities as young militants we owe no apologies
3337742 i will not bow down to history i am a proud participant in history to sit here and condemn what i took part in i would not
3337743 for you to now elect your own representatives and senators was predicated upon our struggles
3337744 the activisms of the 80s were necessary to address the problems associated with the 70s and the activisms of the 90s were necessary for the injustices of the 80s if that is radicalism so be it
3337745 when treated as a human you will behave as a human but when you are treated as an animal you behave indifferently i think we made the right choice eventhough we made mistakes serious mistakes of moral cowardice and recklessness being full of passion
3337746 can you imagine just to name a few of the injustices and humiliation at the time my younger brother was taken from school at the b w harris only to join others during a parade to condemn his own father my father while i was then in freetown
3337747 the basis of our crisis is that we got involved in a situation developing very fast without the right political leadership to comprehend what was happening in the country as such the society exploded our duty as young revolutionaries was to understand the explosion if you like to call it opportunism in history as in politics especially the violent politics of it is that those who make that history must survive enough to write about that history
3337748 thought then that moja was not an element of choruses with a choirmaster
3337749 the people were annoyed they came in the streets in their thousands
3337750 in such situations especially of horror sometimes one could see anyone dressed in white which could be similar description provided if one would ask 50 persons how a ghost looks but i am not still convinced if it were the americans
3337751 the americans do not carry out their operations in the form of using one of their agents to assassinate a president it could have been white people from another country
3337752 many people have said the american were involved there is no conclusive evidence on that let me give my own analysis isnt this possible there were lebanese in the assassination of tolbert why do i say this i remember that the first consignment of ak 47 rifles the prc got came from the plo of yasser arafat
3337753 many people have said that the americans were involved there is no conclusive evidence on that let me give my own analysis isnt this possible that there were lebanese involved in the assassination of tolbert why do i say this i remembered the first consignment of ak 47 riffles the prc got came from the plo of yasser arafat
3337754 it is said that mrs tolbert claimed she saw white hands you know i am always amused by people who claimed they see ghosts because you know if you asked 50 people whether they have seen ghosts and 49 of them answered saying i have seen ghosts asked them the color of cloth the ghost had on they will say white
3337755 that lead to that is extreme fears these people said they were white people i have read a little bit about americans involvement in such matters the americans would not used a doe who they did not know and have not interacted with the americans do not operate in this way they dont operate in this way
3337756 but let me assumed for a moment that mrs tolbert did see white hands let assumed by the time of the coup mr tolbert had put himself into some deadly and political maneuvering mr tolbert had endorsed the polisario front he had moved closed to
3337757 i know one thing these prc guys never never revealed how they killed tolbert
3337758 and i think i know the answer is simple they had no plans they were only after the spoils of the moment they had been part of the rice riot they had seen guns and the regime had made a mistake of arresting people like george boley chea cheapoo who were closed to these guys and i guessed when somebody crafted and released this information that tolbert was o n his way to zimbabwe and that instruction had been left behind to execute the ppp people which i didnt believe somebody leaked that information unfortunately for mr tolbert he never went to the bentol he went to the mansion
3337759 the 1980 coup set the political opportunities that the americans enjoy indicating that it was after the coup that he along with dr togba nah tipoteh met the american embassy political officer at the speaking on his relationship with exiled former president charles taylor h b as he is commonly called said that his last encounter with taylor was in september of 1989 before he unleashed his revolution supported by libya on liberia taylor was rearrested by the ghanaian government after it was known that he escaped from prison and was taking men to to be trained to come to liberia but at that time he fahnbulleh had left for he said that later it was told that blaise campore came from and negotiated with the ghanaian government and that on the basis of african solidarity was turned over to blaise who took him to libya and introduced him to president khadaffi and other military officials had political greed therefore i could not work with him because i knew that from the names of those on the listing of mr taylor he was staging a revenge and not a revolution
3337760 i do not believe in the better of two evils i moved over to unleashed his plans on our country and people i later moved over to the and met with the ivorian defense minister and told him of what was happening in my country and asked if whether his president was aware all he told me was that his president had said that if the palm oil has wasted there is no need to step in it around the room and i understood it anyway
3337761 how can someone lead a revolution wherein none of his own kind was eliminated it was only the children of the people that were killed including jackson e doe and others that was a conspiracy and our intention was to stop them
3337762 they may have good platforms but if you miscalculate and place madmen in offices of public trusts they will damage the country or plunge it into chaos as was done in the past let us be mindful for sooner or later i may not accept political position for i have passed that stage but if you the young ones allow madmen to preside over your destiny you are doomed
3337763 part and parcel of a party that distributed poverty and disease
3337764 look there is ellen johnson sirleaf dressed in the military outfit
3337765 in july of 1985 my sister who was the sole breadwinner of our family died and i craved for release to see my sisters burial but was denied and it aggrieved me
3337766 i was not totally surprised when i heard that taylor was in liberia i was an expert on taylor having dealt with him many times in ghana along with mr tom kamara tom kamara is the owner and publisher of the new democrat newspaper published in liberia and on
3337767 we discussed it and i told him if he did he would not directly engage with those whom he really wanted
3337768 taylor told us that he left prison in the united states after he was able to cut the prison bar and went under ground in new york and fled to mexico if that was factual i did not investigate
3337769 i knew that doe was to be captured on september 9 1989 i knew what was happening i was not blind to the reality though i watched it on the cnn and read it on the new york times but i mustered the courage to return home from the united states i landed home on september 24 1990
3337770 anything the military did while we were engaged with the peoples redemption council prc we take responsibilities as young militants we owe no apologies
3337771 i will not bow down to history i am a proud participant in history to sit here and condemn what i took part in i would not
3337772 for you to now elect your own representatives and senators was predicated upon our struggles
3337773 we owe no one apologies for our role in fighting this oligarchy why should we apologize for what we proudly did they imprisoned our fathers we went to jail at the tender age of 18 they jailed my sister at a tender age too they killed scores of unarmed demonstrators who were simply protesting and exercising their rights why cant they apologize for those excesses i owe no one absolutely no one an apology
3337774 the activisms of the 80s were necessary to address the problems associated with the 70s and the activisms of the 90s were necessary for the injustices of the 80s if that is radicalism so be it
3337775 when treated as a human you will behave as a human but when you are treated as an animal you behave indifferently i think we made the right choice eventhough we made mistakes serious mistakes of moral cowardice and recklessness being full of passion

3337784 that lead to that is extreme fears these people said they were white people i have read a little bit about americans involvement in such matters the americans would not used a doe who they did not know and have not interacted with the americans do not operate in this way they dont operate in this way
3337785 but let me assumed for a moment that mrs tolbert did see white hands let assumed by the time of the coup mr tolbert had put himself into some deadly and political maneuvering
3337786 i know one thing these prc guys never never revealed how they killed tolbert
3337787 and i think i know the answer is simple they had no plans they were only after the spoils of the moment they had been part of the rice riot they had seen guns and the regime had made a mistake of arresting people like george boley chea cheapoo who were closed to these guys and i guessed when somebody crafted and released this information that tolbert was o n his way to zimbabwe and that instruction had been left behind to execute the ppp people which i didnt believe somebody leaked that information unfortunately for mr tolbert he never went to the bentol he went to the mansion
3337788 the 1980 coup set the political opportunities that the americans enjoy indicating that it was after the coup that he along with dr togba nah tipoteh met the american embassy political officer at the speaking on his relationship with exiled former president charles taylor h b as he is commonly called said that his last encounter with taylor was in september of 1989 before he unleashed his revolution supported by libya on liberia taylor was rearrested by the ghanaian government after it was known that he escaped from prison and was taking men to to be trained to come to liberia but at that time he fahnbulleh had left for he said that later it was told that blaise campore came from and negotiated with the ghanaian government and that on the basis of african solidarity was turned over to blaise who took him to libya and introduced him to president khadaffi and other military officials had political greed therefore i could not work with him because i knew that from the names of those on the listing of mr taylor he was staging a revenge and not a revolution
3337789 i do not believe in the better of two evils i moved over to unleashed his plans on our country and people i later moved over to the and met with the ivorian defense minister and told him of what was happening in my country and asked if whether his president was aware all he told me was that his president had said that if the palm oil has wasted there is no need to step in it around the room and i understood it anyway
3337790 how can someone lead a revolution wherein none of his own kind was eliminated it was only the children of the people that were killed including jackson e doe and others that was a conspiracy and our intention was to stop them
3337791 they may have good platforms but if you miscalculate and place madmen in offices of public trusts they will damage the country or plunge it into chaos as was done in the past let us be mindful for sooner or later i may not accept political position for i have passed that stage but if you the young ones allow madmen to preside over your destiny you are doomed

3337795 our study shows that early weight loss can reduce the risk factors that so often lead to diabetes complications and death
3337796 weve known for a long time that weight loss is an important component in diabetes treatment and prevention now it appears there may be a critical window of opportunity following diagnosis in which some lasting gains can be achieved if people are willing to take immediate steps toward lifestyle changes
3337797 we dont know if the initial weight loss increased the bodys sensitivity to insulin or if the sustained lifestyle changes were the reason for the long term health benefits
3337798 but we do know that losing weight reduces the risk factors that often lead to heart disease blindness nerve and kidney damage amputations and death in type 2 diabetes patients

3337836 i started under coyote because there are always conspiracy theorists out there or at least some in oregon who would have immediately recognized who i was and would have assumed that i was starting the blog with an agenda to run for office or something
3337837 i did not want to spend the early days arguing with conspiracy hawks saying i was someones mouth piece or something like that

3337974 tapi hati kenapa kemarin aku aku tidak merasakan nikmatnya suasana pagi
3337975 karena tiap pagi engkau disibukkan dengan aktifitasmu sekaan engkau dikejar waktu bangun dari tidur yang engkau ingat hanyalah tugas ujianmu yang menumpuk janjimu dengan temanmu amanahmu yang katamu sebagai aktifis dan seabrek aktifitas yang menodong fikiranmu hingga tak ada waktumu untuk duduk dan merenungi merasakan betapa besar karunia nya betapa agung ciptaan nya padahal semua kan dapat menambah rasa syukur dan keimananmu
3337976 tidakkah engkau lihat hidupku dipenuhi banyak masalah aneka peristiwa dan kaya akan ekspresi kadang hari ini aku gembira melompat lompat karena kegirangan dan senyum manis menghiasi wajahku namun esok tiga hari sepekan sebulan kemudian aku tersedu sedu hatiku panas karena amarah terasa perih tercabik cabik oleh rasa kecewa serta dihakimi oleh ribuan sesal wahai hati kenapa hidup ini seperti itu apakah hanya hidupku saja yang merasakannya
3337977 hidup itu penuh warna namun untuk menjadikannya seideal yang kamu mau butuh mujahadah darimu dalam pendidikan nilai yang bagus tidak terpajang dengan sendirinya di daftar nilaimu gelar dan pangkat tidak akan datang dengan sendirinya tanpa usahamu sampai masalah pendamping pun jangan pernah berharap akan mendapatkan sosok seperti ali bin abi thalib jika kamu tak berusaha menjadi sosok fatimah az zahrah semua butuh proses dan dari proses itulah engakau akan berbenturan dengan banyak hal ingat bukan hanya engkau yang berjuang seperti itu tapi semua manusia walau tipenya berbeda pandanglah di sekelilingmu
3337978 bersyukur karena banyak karunia yang ia rasakan tidak ia sadari untuk disyukuri
3337979 allah tidak akan menguji hamba nya di luar batas kemampuannya

3338038 i credit the experience of making breathing lessons with re igniting my faith in the idea of making films i remember telling all my friends stupidly that this was the last film i was going to make the process of fundraising was just so enervating then of course making the film was so rewarding and i was so happy with it and happy that mark liked it that the drama went out the window
3338039 theres such a strong feeling of community and goodness coming out of this place i think the film will explore that area between art and healing not art as therapy but as a way to find some meaning and beauty in what seems like the most traumatic and terrible experiences
3338040 i havent encountered any situation where i felt i was denied something solely because i was an asian and a woman in independent films theres not a lot of money and its really your own motivation your own hard work that determines how far you go
3338041 there are so many opportunities and its slightly jarring for someone who came out of the independent world i find that as much as we like to bitch about not having help along the way theres something very strengthening about working in your own little circle and making your own decisions
3338042 its so memorable because it exceeds your expectations it really surprises you thats what i look for in films
3338043 i dont really cruise the web a lot if i have a specific research need ill run some sort of search

3338059 mostly i hear yelling and screaming very little content the host usually has very little knowledge theyre just there to get ratings by ranting and raving and stirring the pot and getting peoples emotions revved and they call that radio i call that an abuse of airwaves

3338077 too powerful music would be here without mtv it certainly was before it i dont think tv ruined the movies
3338078 whats so appealing about it is its so unmanageable i hope mtv can stay connected to it in a good way

3338088 it was a fluke that pretty much spun my head around
3338089 i deal with all aspects of music in the film music coming out of a car radio background music and on camera performances
3338090 its most important to carry out a directors visions youre always asking what does the director want the audience to feel when i hear music i can visualize story lines and themes im really conscious of how it makes me feel music is really subtle the way it can change your mood
3338091 im on the phone with music publishers record label reps managers record producers artists and songwriters trying to find that perfect song for each scene
3338092 its a small competitive field paying dues is part of the process
3338093 movies are always being made the studios are beginning to recognize the importance of music supervision and are even beginning to hire in house supervisors
3338094 i feel that i have a handful of credits and people are just starting to recognize my maiden name i want to keep that momentum going but in the big picture i dont know if adding on another name will make that much of a difference

3338114 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people
3338115 these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3338116 its time for russia to be true to its word to act to end this crisis
3338117 the russians have clearly overreacted but president saakashvili for some reason seems to think he has a hall pass from this administration
3338118 we knew they were going to go crack heads we told them again and again not to do this
3338119 we thought we had an understanding with the russians that any response would be south ossetia focused clearly its not
3338120 i would say that we mostly were focused elsewhere unlike during the cold war when wed see a single soviet armor battalion move so yes the size and scope of the russian move has come as something of a surprise
3338121 while their utility in country may be very limited removing them might inadvertently signal to the world that we are abandoning our ally which we most certainly are not
3338122 a film is a very specific and personal account of bill carters experience in sarajevo during the war and we would very much like to make the film here
3338123 this is a departure from the very big hollywood productions
3338124 im not in fact playing bill in this movie but i read the script and the very human story at the very core of this film spoke to me very clearly
3338125 hopefully we can get this movie to be made at the end of this year to come here and shoot would be just wonderful
3338126 i wouldnt brag about it unless i had the optional slice battery to go with it
3338127 thanks to the improvements in handwriting recognition and the pen flicks
3338128 these results mark a cornerstone in the development of euv lithography they represent the first real 22 nm resist data building confidence for euv as a viable technology for 22 nm half pitch lithography
3338129 partnering with resist suppliers to accelerate resist cycles of learning has been critical to bringing euv resist readiness to this point where euv resists can now support 22 nm half pitch imaging the combination of sematech and resist supplier expertise has been an indispensable asset in conducting this important advanced research
3338130 this achievement was deemed to be impossible by leading resist experts only a few years ago resist suppliers have made excellent progress in improving euv resist resolution thanks to access to the mets which provide the highest resolution available worldwide among euv optical imaging systems
3338131 the focus of sematechs euv resist development program is to engineer current car platforms to realize 22 nm high pitch introduction and provide a fundamental understanding of euv resist exposure mechanisms to develop new platforms
3338132 we believe this two pronged approach will drive resist development to the highest level and support euvl introduction

3338136 what the russians just did is for the first time since the fall of the soviet union they have taken a decisive military action and imposed a military reality
3338137 theyve done it unilaterally and all of the countries that have been looking to the west to intimidate the russians are now forced into a position to consider what just happened
3338138 was die russen jetzt getan haben ist da sie erstmals seit dem zusammenbrechen der sowjetunion eine entscheidende milit raktion durchgef hrt und milit rische realit t erzwungen haben
3338139 sie haben es unilateral getan und alle die l nder die in richtung westen geschaut haben um die russen einzusch chtern werden jetzt in die position gezwungen zu bedenken was gerade passiert ist

3338142 what hooked me and i discovered this during the success of flashdance her first movie was having an influence on pop culture a year after flashdance came out all over the country there were girls in torn sweatshirts following their dreams
3338143 very recently around age 40 agents started calling me with their breaking movie stars that meant i had influence in casting with the studio

3338147 ultimately the voice of the producer is deferred once you get a script into production you have to defer to the director which is appropriate because its a directors medium theres a part of me that wanted to escape from that deferred voice

3338152 atomic bombing is probably 10 to 100 times cheaper than ordinary bombing
3338153 this cheapness is a new factor and indicates that an unparalleled loss of human resources will accompany future wars the ability of small nations to do great damage is also a consequence of the cheapness
3338154 since the atomic bomb art is in its infancy we may well expect future economies of a factor of 10 in cost per square mile destroyed
3338155 to determine to what extent the behavior of a nation in war can be predicted from the behavior of her troops in individual battles

3338168 alcohols possess superior combustion characteristics to gasoline which allow greater optimisation

3338186 creo que podr an haber esperado un poco si quer an un xito mundial los tengo a todos ah arriba
3338187 lo que todos sabemos es que el se or rodr guez zapatero aprob un estatuto y ahora por lo que se ve no est dispuesto a cumplirlo y eso ha originado un problema grav simo dentro del psoe pero a mi no me preocupan los problemas del psoe sino que me preocupan los problemas de los espa oles
3338188 le pasa a quien act a como aprendiz de brujo
3338189 est metido en el problema y no sabe c mo salir
3338190 l es el presidente del gobierno y tiene que dar una soluci n
3338191 la sensaci n que se est transmitiendo es que el gobierno est absolutamente a la deriva
3338192 yo lo que le ofrezco al se or rodr guez zapatero es un consenso y un acuerdo en esta materia pero es su responsabilidad aceptar esta oferta que el partido popular le est haciendo
3338193 afecta a la propia estabilidad del psoe y por tanto a la propia estabilidad del gobierno en un momento de crisis econ mica
3338194 lo peor que nos puede pasar a todos los espa oles es que encima los apoyos del gobierno est n divididos
3338195 ha generado un l o muy importante dentro de su propio partido
3338196 le amenaza ahora con no apoyar los presupuestos generales del estado y hacer caer el gobierno
3338197 no era buena para los catalanes ni para el conjunto de espa a
3338198 y ahora continu el se or rodr guez zapatero con su actuaci n est enga ando a la gente una vez m s
3338199 es que cumpla lo que el propio rodr guez zapatero aprob
3338200 si el se or rodr guez zapatero lo aprueba y no lo cumple la pregunta habr que hac rsela a l
3338201 lo que ha sembrado zapatero no es bueno para espa a
3338202 en pol tica como en tantas y tantas facetas de la vida cada uno recoge lo que siembra y desgraciadamente lo que ha sembrado rodr guez zapatero como estamos viendo ahora no es nada bueno para espa a
3338203 a hablar a dialogar y a buscar un acuerdo entre todos
3338204 este espect culo que tiene como responsable al presidente del gobierno tiene que terminar
3338205 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3338206 half of all business income in the united states now ends up going through the individual tax code
3338207 its time for the big corporations to pay their fair share
3338208 car buying is more emotional than buying most things more emotional than buying perfume a new house 5 000 stereo equipment and so on
3338209 the first piece of advice is the boy scout motto be prepared
3338210 and theres no reason why you cant be prepared because everything you need to know you can find on the internet
3338211 you know what you can afford you know what you think your payments should be you know what your financing options are you know the car you want
3338212 so youre in a pretty strong confident position when you go in there and the dealer will know that you have that information
3338213 the payments on a lease tend to be lower but you dont own the car but if you are the type of person that always wants to be driving a brand new vehicle and perhaps even a higher end vehicle and you want lower payments leasing is an option for you
3338214 usually the mileage is limited to 12 000 to 15 000 a year and then you have to pay over that
3338215 and there are some vehicles that you cant lease and it is also dependent on depreciation if it is prone to depreciation the payments cover the cost of depreciation
3338216 you may be looking at a new honda accord but you have a hankering for a bmw or an audi and you might want to go onto a web site and see how much a 2006 bmw goes for and that may end up being a better deal for you than a new vehicle
3338217 its a much more pleasant and efficient process to submit a request for a certain kind of vehicle have that dealer call you back or e mail you or offer a price or you can ask the dealer for more information
3338218 you can say yes or no and then you can walk into the dealership and do the paperwork
3338219 the shorter the period of the loan the less interest you are going to pay
3338220 you can also see some manufacturers that offer zero percent interest for vehicles that they are anxious to move but you have to be very careful to understand what the fees are and what you are putting up front
3338221 the dealer really wants to make room for those newer vehicles that are going to be coming onto his lots so he has more of an incentive to move the older models off his lots and that puts him in a better position to make a good deal
3338222 if you know that the trade in value of your vehicle is you are armed with that knowledge before you walk into the dealership then you are in a powerful position

3338230 when youve got grouping that are 30 year plus incumbents its smarter to set on the fence than garner a horse that doesnt win
3338231 the bounteous difficulty with don is that he used the money he was given for legal fees thats not why grouping contributed to him so that created incredible uproar amongst the money group
3338232 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state such an state is unacceptable in the 21st century we have no doubts about it this is a deliberate endeavor to destroy an entire land and modify the regime
3338233 as soon as i arrived at the department i called in general marshall and asked him whether he had received my message through mccarthy and he told me that he had and that the speech had been changed and made in an entirely different form
3338234 i then took up with harrison bundy and groves the third paper to be issued in s 1 namely that of the scientists the draft of this paper henry dewolf smyths a general account of the development of methods of using atomic energy for military purposes which would be known later in the year as atomic energy for military purposes 1945 and then more generally and unofficially as the smyth report is about two hundred pages long manifestly so big that i cannot possibly read it now and i therefore went over the skeleton of it and the pros and cons of making any speech as to which i am very doubtful with my three consultants the aim of the paper is to backfire reckless statements by independent scientists after the demonstration of the bomb if we could be sure that these could be controlled and avoided all of us would much prefer not to issue such a paper but under the circumstances of the entire independence of action of scientists and the certainty that there would be a tremendous amount of excitement and reckless statement groves who is a very conservative man had reached the conclusion that the lesser evil would be for us to make a statement carefully prepared so as not to give away anything vital and thus try to take the stage away from the others we debated long over the situation for it is a very difficult question and all of us recognize its difficulty rules have been drawn under which this present paper has been formulated i went over those rules and then postponed the matter until tomorrow when i shall have a talk with conant groves bundy and some of groves assistants on the whole matter i am of course much influenced by the fact that groves has reached a decision in favor of the statement
3338235 the ultimate responsibility for our nations policy rests on its citizens and they can discharge such responsibilities wisely only if they are informed the average citizen cannot be expected to understand clearly how an atomic bomb is constructed or how it works but there is in this country a substantial group of engineers and scientists who can understand such things and who can explain their potentialities of atomic bombs to their fellow citizens the present report is written for this professional group and is a matter of fact general account of work in the usa since 1939 aimed at the production of such bombs it is neither a documented official history nor a technical treatise for experts secrecy requirements have affected both the detailed content and general emphasis so that many interesting developments have been omitted
3338236 kurzfristig sehen wir aufgrund der zunehmenden geopolitischen spannungen weiterhin potenzial f r eine gegenbewegung bis auf 120 je barrel wir sind der meinung dass der markt das risiko von angebotsunterbrechungen aufgrund des kaukasus konflikts untersch tzt

3338242 this contract manufacturing relationship marks another important step in our strategic plan for the development of nasulin we are currently focused on completing phase ii trials of nasulin and securing a partner for late stage nasulin development
3338243 forming a relationship with a well regarded contract manufacturer like dpt will benefit cpex in a number of ways in the near term securing manufacturing capacity for nasulin provides us with an uninterrupted supply of product to complete our phase ii clinical activities and for subsequent phase iii trials longer term by assuring that there neednt be a gap between the supply of clinical materials and the supply of product for commercialization the agreement potentially eliminates manufacturing delays that could affect bringing nasulin to market we believe this significantly enhances the value of nasulin for potential partners
3338244 we believe it makes sound business sense to join a patent estate for nuclear transfer that has been tested and is recognized as dominant with a leading operating company in the field
3338245 we have built a world class team of cloning practitioners and have key industry relationships in place
3338246 we are now creating a company that holds the proprietary intellectual property and has demonstrated operating leadership in the field customers can secure a license to practice or contract cloning services
3338247 our company has demonstrated expertise in use of nuclear transfer technology to clone animals for better breeding
3338248 to date more than a dozen species have been successfully cloned there is a clear utility for animal cloning ranging from agricultural applications to the conservation of endangered species and biopharmaceutical production

3338255 one of the challenges is that these things are just flying all over the hemisphere
3338256 so to figure out the needs of these birds sorting out the why requires this huge geographic understanding of the populations and nobody really has that

3338262 with a little dns spoofing i fed my own list into the iphone and effectively killed by name applications that attempt to use the gps it looks like thats all its set to do right now but i may just not have found the vaporise switch
3338263 either it is an anti malware solution and the iphone has a switch somewhere to vaporise any app or its not an anti malware solution and is really designed to kill applications that interfere with apples business model such as unsanctioned traffic navigation software
3338264 unless for some reason they decided to build two separate mechanisms into the iphone to do this of which the other one is invisible this one likely feeds a master kill switch perhaps there is a special setting in the configuration file which can vaporise the app all together
3338265 you should never have been in that situation to begin with and again brings up the question is the iphone really an enterprise device
3338266 on the other hand how did the i am rich app get through

3338280 its systems go for charter change and we are supporting joint congressional resolution 10 which is pending in the senate
3338281 we are putting our support to the senate which already mustered a substantial number of senators who affixed their signatures to the resolution
3338282 we expect that a similar move in the house of representatives will snowball to concur with the senates overwhelming support to the move this is our way forward in the effort to set up a federal system in mindanao to respond to the aspiration of our muslim communities in the south
3338283 she strongly believes there must be reform in the constitution
3338284 so its not correct to say that the cat is out of bag right now when she has been saying this when she campaigned for president she supported it
3338285 i would like to say that resolution 10 speaks only of a federal system it does not deal with the adoption of a parliamentary system under which gloria can conceivably extend her term by running for prime minister
3338286 there may be truth to the insinuation that the peace agreement that the administration has worked out with the moro islamic liberation front may be used by malaca ang as a pretense to amend the constitution to enable mrs arroyo to circumvent the constitutional ban against her reelection
3338287 not to commit the mistake of riding on the federalism proposal to perpetuate mrs arroyo in power because this is bound to be repudiated by the people

3338296 europe must reassess its present security and foreign policy and bring it into line with the new reality we must thoroughly reason out what a significantly changed state of security in europes neighborhood means for estonia

3338429 connecting our 90 000 plus members with relevant documents in the wkb repository within seconds and then sharing that content with other forum members is our goal
3338430 the wkb shows promising capabilities that have already demonstrated great utility for example doctrinal content in army field manuals published in english arabic used in iraq or english pushto used in afghanistan can be difficult to discover access and understand using a traditional database approach the file sizes are also very large which could make finding relevant content a time consuming task on a low bandwidth network the metadata assigned to these types of documents and the fact that content can be discovered and viewed page by page without having to download the file allows discovery and use of only the relevant content bcks has the capability to store and manage content in 37 different languages
3338431 we knew we had to provide content discovery and access at the page level to be of any value to forward deployed soldiers and the dod da contractors and civilians who support them they have neither the bandwidth nor the time to download a large file only to discover its not what they wanted
3338432 the application program interface api developed by mark logic for the army is unique in that it parses and indexes content at the page level and applies discovery metadata based on the ddms and a bcks customized schema
3338433 visible accessible understandable trusted interoperable manageable and responsive to user needs via a service oriented architecture
3338434 mark logics technology and software engineering expertise were important to the success of this project
3338435 we needed a solution that would maximize our use of xml and xquery so soldiers da civilians and dod contractors could find what they need and quickly apply it and mark logic delivered marklogic server takes full advantage of xml and the mark logic engineering team is there every step of the way providing us with the experience and direction to make this a successful program thanks to mark logic bcks is one of the first organizations to employ xml based technology to achieve km objectives in such an innovative way our next step is to integrate our knowledge base with that of others and move interoperability into the joint interagency and multinational jim environment

3338624 referees are an essential part of any game recruiting retaining and developing more referees is an important component of our national football development plan and we are delighted to have mario join us to help take this forward
3338625 mario was a top level referee for more than 25 years including 12 years and 135 matches as an international fifa referee
3338626 obviously with the start of the hyundai a league this week mario will be focusing on the competition and providing support and advice to our panel of elite referees

3338719 i walk every day about four miles and was coming into west lafayette on old 16 when i saw lorettas van i went on by but was intrigued and went back and started talking to her and then don came up i went home and told my husband about what he was doing and regis was excited about it he started putting on his running clothes because he wanted to go out and walk with him
3338720 its amazing to me if i had left later or don had walked faster that day we never would have met and im glad we did
3338721 he told me that he had done charity runs and other runs and i was impressed with all the running he did
3338722 he told me he got bored walking he was one to take off we got acquainted that day and became good friends
3338723 he loved helping people and running he loved life and had a good spirit

3338740 ser mais ou menos id ntica do ano passado muito exigente quase com as mesmas chegadas troc mos um pouco a ordem das etapas e a sim diferente temos o contra rel gio final que muito duro e ir fazer algumas diferen as
3338741 ano do c ndido n o sei vou fazer o meu melhor sempre foi a minha forma de estar na modalidade vamos ver como est o os advers rios j vi na ltima competi o que h alguns bastante fortes
3338742 tudo se ultrapassou e agora estou bastante bem a pensar na volta esta uma fase complicada estes ltimos dias que antecedem a volta a portugal s o dias de bastante esfor o e treino intensivo mas estou moralizado para tentar fazer o meu melhor dentro da mesma linha do que tenho vindo a fazer nos ltimos anos
3338743 neste momento o hector guerra liberty que ganhou este ltimo gp o destaque n o sei at que ponto consigo super lo na serra da estrela na senhora da gra a e no contra rel gio por tr s tenho mais homens no benfica que podem estar na discuss o final temos mais do que um trunfo dentro da equipa e por isso estamos tranquilos
3338744 eu o ruben plaza e o jos azevedo podemos estar na discuss o pela volta dia a dia iremos estar presentes os tr s para estarmos na discuss o final haver dias em que eu o z ou o ruben poderemos ter op es mais directas uma quest o da hora e do dia e a teremos de ser n s a discutir a corrida em cima da bicicleta
3338745 estamos conscientes que n o vai ser f cil o pelot o deste ano est recheado de equipas com muita qualidade o que torna mais complicada a nossa tarefa no entanto estamos conscientes do nosso valor pelo que n o nos podemos esconder temos valor e argumentos para lutar pela vit ria na volta a portugal
3338746 vai ser uma prova mais competitiva o que cria muitas expectativas em todos quantos gostam de ciclismo o modelo escolhido agrada nos particularmente j que vai possibilitar uma corrida mais aberta e menos t ctica o facto de logo ao quarto dia se cumprir aquela que considerada a etapa ra nha pode ajudar a algumas mudan as de estrat gia fazendo com que os ciclistas que melhor se sentem na montanha possam ter um outro protagonismo
3338747 claramente s o aqueles em quem toda a equipa deposita grandes esperan as t m muita experi ncia est o num bom momento de forma e s o capazes de superar as dificuldades da prova tamb m n o se pode esquecer o andr cardoso que seria ptimo ver repetir o resultado do ano passado provavelmente n o estar no melhor momento muito por for a do esfor o a que foi sujeito e da diferen a de fusos hor rios consequ ncia da sua participa o nos jogos ol mpicos mas a verdade que tem muita ra a e por isso tamb m h que contar com ele os restantes sabem o que se espera deles tendo tarefas bem definidas em fun o das suas caracter sticas pessoais e do perfil de cada etapa
3338748 para mim motivo de especial orgulho poder contar com um profissional como o joaquim andrade no seio do nosso grupo sob todos os pontos de vista um exemplo a seguir e o seu comportamento deve ser um referencial para todos os ciclistas o poder alinhar para a 20 volta a portugal consecutiva sem nunca desistir constitui um momento especial e por isso iremos encarar a sua presen a como um desafio supera o por forma a podermos considerar nos merecedores da sua companhia e do seu exemplo
3338749 aquelas que me parecem mais fortes se bem que tamb m exista gente com muita qualidade nas outras forma es
3338750 equipas como a barloworld a scott ou a ceramica flaminia s o bastante fortes e integram nos seus quadros elementos capazes de fazer a diferen a podendo complicar em muito a nossa tarefa

3338772 great the russian have ruined my vacation and exposed me to an actual crisis
3338773 there were a lot of different people here who all brought a lot of really good ideas that will help benefit everyone i think that there needs to be a lot of effort from a lot of people not just the governor
3338774 the mission of the schools is to ensure every child has the opportunity to succeed economically has the opportunity to become a well rounded person a productive citizen and to do that schools must create an environment that fosters opportunity and innovation
3338775 as we reflect on your mission its critical to focus on devotion to the whole child
3338776 this is the sixth of 12 meetings and thats the comment thats most consistently made that we need a system directed toward the betterment of the whole child
3338777 this is an opportunity for us to think boldly and transform our schools
3338778 people do feel passionate about the system and understand that we ought not to just try to fix what our perceived weaknesses are we need to think about what we ought to be doing
3338779 ive spent a great deal of my first year in office meeting with every educational stakeholder i could ive listened to their frustrations and what they think should be done this is an effort to more fully engage people at a grass roots level

3338788 my mother simply doesnt want to live any more in this situation
3338789 she feels she has lost her second chance at life and her extradition doesnt permit her to imagine herself in the future
3338790 this is a story that i know well because i had to leave italy because of these events
3338791 also because i had friends who were extremely close to slipping into terrorism like you slip into drug use
3338792 the courts have never established the full truth about what happened even though many of the terrorists are free or have never spent a day in jail for the public this is intolerable
3338793 we are now waiting for him to wake up and speak so we can find out more details about what happened
3338794 it presents several new aspects which were not present in previous incidents in xinjiang
3338795 one is the sophisticated coordination of the attacks it was not just one attack its a string of bombings that requires much more planning and a larger organization to carry out especially at the time of the olympics when the security is so high
3338796 if you look at the streets everything seems calm and peaceful
3338797 but behind it all the situation is different people are really angry
3338798 if you are a muslim you are already a criminal suspect in the eyes of the chinese
3338799 apart from the nigeria national petroleum corporation nnpc nigeria customs services nigeria immigration services federal inland revenue services and nigerian communication commission no other government revenue collecting agencies have remitted into the consolidated accounts
3338800 all of them except corporate affairs commission collect revenues on behalf of government and spend all despite this they still come to government for funds in the budget
3338801 the nigerian ports authority for instance in spite of generating about n10billion from its operations was asked by the budget office to remit only n25million to government coffers
3338802 as far as i am concerned the ports concessioning exercise has never benefited the country in any way
3338803 i believe certain government agencies were established just to enrich some privileged individuals the situation is so bad and annoying

3338818 we are here to tell nana akufo addo that this is the time for a woman to be selected
3338819 we also want to assure nana of our support for a female running mate and encourage him to go in for alima mahama and not allow himself to be persuaded by the anti alima lobbyists within the npp
3338820 if the party says she is the one i will take her
3338821 without a doubt the cases are progressing sometimes the judges are making some rulings which are part positive and part negative none of them has an impact on the merits of the case there are more or less procedural matters and that is natural for the judicial process
3338822 the marketing strategies that we see today have been the product of expert contribution including lawyers on how to evade existing legislation or regulation how to advertise their products to evade law and take advantage of weak regulation or no regulation and i just felt that this is completely inappropriate especially when you look at the context of what happened in the united states if its a moral issue in the united states it should be across board worldwide what we see however is that whatever that was adjudged wrong in the united states and western nations is what they have deployed to africa and the developing countries particularly nigeria for me there is something that is extremely irresponsible about that kind of corporate behaviour i feel that it should be stopped
3338823 the legal system would ultimately have its own say and day in the whole discussion what we must recognise is that what have been known to work well have always been a combination of this litigation legislation and awareness and pressure from the community
3338824 if they kill literally thousands of people how do you marry that with an employment for less than a 1000 people how many of the bat employees have been able to leave the employment of bat to be entrepreneurs of their own to employ people or how many of the farmers who plant or produce tobacco have ultimately become wealthy from doing that the only people who benefit at all is the company itself and it is not even a nigerian company because it is 100 per cent wholly owned by a foreign corporation all we get here are the damages possibly in every one of the 900 employees may be there is a smoker in their family so the question to ask is the job and the life of a family member in the scheme of things which will matter more
3338825 the biggest thing they want is changing the behaviour of this industry and how they target the young persons and minors the inappropriate part of their business by surreptitiously continuing to perpetrate what seems to be wrong information the governments will be willing to talk about that then the governments are willing to discuss about the damages as to how this play out obviously the concern of the government is saving lives and further misery that tobacco wreaks on the society

3338890 whenever hotbeds of resistance and other aggressive plans emerge make the decision and eliminate them
3338891 if you receive the order to cease fire this would not mean that we would stop all operations including reconnaissance operations
3338892 it means an end to military action if there is no retaliation there is always a gap between rhetoric and reality the way i read it is that military hostilities are about to end traditionally we will see a few skirmishes but frontal attacks and positioning will end
3338893 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them

3338973 i wouldve been hard pressed to come up with an example where electronic wedding invitations would be acceptable except when real life intervenes
3338974 in the past i never would have thought to use an electronic invitation because i dont know if it was as much of a formality as it was about brand awareness and being so protective over how the brand was portrayed
3338975 people always wanted to speak to the hostess when they made a reservation at a restaurant now they just use opentable
3338976 there was a whole segment of event types that people just did not want to use electronic invitations for
3338977 id like to believe that because of how we do things you also get the aesthetic aspect of it you dont have to sacrifice it
3338978 not having to use paper is huge when youre trying to be eco conscious
3338979 its better for the environment its cheaper if not free and youre collecting the majority of your rsvps in a place where theres no human error people either hit yes no or maybe and itll download into a list
3338980 there are always ways to do paper invitations in a cost effective way
3338981 you can get paper print them yourself hand write them
3338982 that point is actually quite well taken because it does create quite a lot of paper waste what might be interesting is to see if there are people or companies that come up with very low impact ways of generating invitations that are either easily recyclable or directly reusable
3338983 if you really know your guests and you really know its a preference for them i think thats great
3338984 at new york fashion week youve got 12 days of shows and events and its highly highly competitive
3338985 if you dont send out a paper invitation it doesnt work theres something about it landing on someones desk and having it be tactile

3339069 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3339070 half of all business income in the united states now ends up going through the individual tax code
3339071 its time for the big corporations to pay their fair share
3339072 car buying is more emotional than buying most things more emotional than buying perfume a new house 5 000 stereo equipment and so on
3339073 the first piece of advice is the boy scout motto be prepared
3339074 and theres no reason why you cant be prepared because everything you need to know you can find on the internet
3339075 you know what you can afford you know what you think your payments should be you know what your financing options are you know the car you want
3339076 so youre in a pretty strong confident position when you go in there and the dealer will know that you have that information
3339077 the payments on a lease tend to be lower but you dont own the car but if you are the type of person that always wants to be driving a brand new vehicle and perhaps even a higher end vehicle and you want lower payments leasing is an option for you
3339078 usually the mileage is limited to 12 000 to 15 000 a year and then you have to pay over that
3339079 and there are some vehicles that you cant lease and it is also dependent on depreciation if it is prone to depreciation the payments cover the cost of depreciation
3339080 you may be looking at a new honda accord but you have a hankering for a bmw or an audi and you might want to go onto a web site and see how much a 2006 bmw goes for and that may end up being a better deal for you than a new vehicle
3339081 its a much more pleasant and efficient process to submit a request for a certain kind of vehicle have that dealer call you back or e mail you or offer a price or you can ask the dealer for more information
3339082 you can say yes or no and then you can walk into the dealership and do the paperwork
3339083 the shorter the period of the loan the less interest you are going to pay
3339084 you can also see some manufacturers that offer zero percent interest for vehicles that they are anxious to move but you have to be very careful to understand what the fees are and what you are putting up front
3339085 the dealer really wants to make room for those newer vehicles that are going to be coming onto his lots so he has more of an incentive to move the older models off his lots and that puts him in a better position to make a good deal
3339086 if you know that the trade in value of your vehicle is you are armed with that knowledge before you walk into the dealership then you are in a powerful position

3339089 a couple of years ago the afghan government wanted to develop a ranger like or a special operations like structure in the military
3339090 the ana were large and laborious the ana is a good army its a developing army but they need a smaller more agile flexible force and so the commandos were the solution
3339091 signal is probably one of the most difficult things to teach the afghan recruits and a lot of it goes back to previous education
3339092 its difficult to explain the background of how a radio works so we try to cut a lot of theory out of it and just take it to practical application this is how it works and this is how you should make it work
3339093 guys come in and you got lumps of clay they really dont know a lot about training and light infantry tactics
3339094 its kind of you tear them down and build them up again its the same thing theres a lot of similarities between what we experience in ranger school in the united states and what theyre experiencing here in commando school
3339095 we issue them uniforms boots helmets weapons vehicles radios everything that theyre going to need
3339096 all of this stuff here will all redeploy with them when they go
3339097 you cant expect them to do the job we want them to do without having the right tools
3339098 i want to change the old policy ill go to america ill learn special training and come back here where i will teach my junior officers in the future
3339099 it will help change my country my army everything will be better
3339100 commando forces are like we say the jewel of the army
3339101 its precious forces for the afghan national army we have the best training we have the best equipment and we can conduct dangerous missions
3339102 id say the best way to describe them is theyre steadfast in their improvement theyre dedicated we really do see them as afghani patriots and i think the way ahead is pretty bright their heart is in the right place
3339103 we are doing operations in four different provinces around here
3339104 as soon as we get word that were needed we can get ready in 20 to 25 minutes and can stop any kind of bad activities
3339105 and i think thats why the commandos are so important
3339106 they are afghans they understand the country they understand the history they can interact with the population in a way that no outsider ever could
3339107 we may hide it in a wall or something in our own home back in the united states
3339108 the afghans know they wouldnt hide it in their house theyd keep it away because wed find it in their house so they understand the customs the way people actually do things and it assists us in our planning
3339109 insurgency and counter insurgency is an intimate struggle in the nation and ultimately it has to be an afghan fight
3339110 you need to feed them you need to resupply them you need to give them equipment you need to give them mobility cars trucks helicopters
3339111 not an suv not a wagon not a coupe and not a sedan we aimed for a more road focused vehicle and sporty direction

3339118 since gary could not make it to the summer of sonic fan event in covent garden today i fulfilled my duty as staunch ukr supporter and strolled down to the dragon hall venue theyd hired for the day
3339119 i turned up very late since i was in bed most of the day and as a result i missed performances by richard jacques and tj lewis sonic r vocals girl which was a shame as id been looking forward to that
3339120 however organiser svend joscelyne of sonic stadium told me therell be videos of everything available shortly they had other guest appearances too like a dude who draws all the artwork in the comics
3339121 the event was impressively well organised and there was a huge turnout of die hard sonic fans some fans came from as far as usa and australia they were all well into it but some were uber fans like a girl named tru 24 who dressed very convincingly as dr robotnik and others who were brought to tears by the emotion of it all i heard one sonic admirer say best time of my life serious stuff here guys
3339122 the event was supported by some sort of community manager from sega europe and there were shitloads of prizes and stuff plus some nice artwork for upcoming sonic games around the place
3339123 as someone who still likes sega it was nice for me to see how people do still love sonic in a big way i mean i could tell you most things about sonic but these guys are on a different level of fandom

3339127 we cannot take such allegations lightly because in these areas whenever such rumours spread there is certain to be trouble unless the government acts to arrest the situation

3339148 bluegrass is african american actually its origin is french just like rap but it has nothing to do with folk folk is irish pop music concocted in the 50s and 60s which uses instruments that werent invented until the 30s
3339149 wrong the plays of aristophanes prove that the overwhelming majority of athenians were straight and idiogenogamotics were ridiculed as either being effeminate or only doing kologamosis in return for political or financial favours if this was not so then aristophanes would not have mocked the politicians in the front seats as boy fuckers kologamosis with young boys will illegal in ancient athens and those engaging in it were banned from holding elected office or made numerous bum gags or brought naked girls on stage for an all male audience to represent peace or written plays featuring female prostitutes hellenistic romantic fiction such as the aethiopica also disproves your claims that women were only regarded as baby making machines menanders dyskolos also disproves your claims as does book 3 of apollonius argonougtica and euripides hellen kolofilia was nothing more than masturbation just ask yourself why it was only with a man and adolescent boy because it was easier for the giver to think the receiver was a young girl than if it was with a man the same age he might as well have fucked a sheep or a goat so to get back on topic it makes you wonder why rtd made captain jack an omnisexual read complete wanker

3339205 in genesis 41 14 36 pharaoh the egyptian god who presided over the resources of the superpower had a bad dream in the midst of is limitless abundance that is the gift of the nile he had a nightmare about scarcity you know the dream of thin cows and thin years of grain several years of famine to come but do you know the policy that arose from the nightmare of scarcity as policies are always arising from our nightmares in genesis 47 joseph son of israel child of the abundant creator god signed on for the pharaonic nightmare of scarcity he went to work for the interests of corporate acquisitiveness organized an imperial monopoly and over a three year period seized in the interest of the corporate economy the money of the peasants the cattle of the peasants the land of the peasants and eventually the life of the peasants who were reduced to slavery this achievement was all accomplished by a true son of israel who was seduced as we often are into the nightmare of scarcity you may be sure that this anxiety over the coming famine there was no rest in the surge of confiscation no time off no sabbath the machinery of acquisitiveness worked 24 7 until pharaoh by the genius of joseph achieved total monopoly that is how our people by the book of exodus ended up in slavery one among us believed excessively in the nightmare of scarcity that contradicted the abundance of the creator god thus genesis 47 stands as a prelude to the exodus narrative and indicates that a mistrust of creations abundance created the crisis of the exodus narrative pharaohs nightmare of scarcity disrupted creation and eventually evoked the plagues that constitute creation performing like chaos a massive threat to order and abundance

3339290 the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america in essence the americans have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals
3339291 4 2 of gdp more than a quarter of all georgian public income to military hardware
3339292 georgia could have used the years of saakashvilis presidency in different ways to build up the economy to develop the infrastructure to solve social issues both in south ossetia abkhazia and the whole state instead the georgian leadership with president saakashvili undertook consistent steps to increase its military budget from us 30 million to 1 billion georgia was preparing for a military action
3339293 in addition to the spy drones israel has also been supplying georgia with infantry weapons and electronics for artillery systems and has helped upgrade soviet designed su 25 ground attack jets assembled in georgia according to koba liklikadze an independent military expert in tbilisi former israeli generals also serve as advisers to the georgian military
3339294 the conflict has been sparked by the race for control over the pipelines carrying oil and gas out of the caspian region the russians may just bear with the pro us georgian president mikhail saakashvilis ambition to bring his country into nato but they draw a heavy line against his plans and those of western oil companies including israeli firms to route the oil routes from azerbaijan and the gas lines from turkmenistan which transit georgia through turkey instead of hooking them up to russian pipelines jerusalem owns a strong interest in caspian oil and gas pipelines reach the turkish terminal port of ceyhan rather than the russian network intense negotiations are afoot between israel turkey georgia turkmenistan and azarbaijan for pipelines to reach turkey and thence to israels oil terminal at ashkelon and on to its red sea port of eilat from there supertankers can carry the gas and oil to the far east through the indian ocean
3339295 as far as natural resources are concerned russias hand is very strong it holds 6 6 percent of the worlds proven oil reserves and 26 percent of the worlds gas reserves in addition it currently accounts for 12 percent of world oil and 21 of recent world gas production in may 2007 russia was the worlds largest oil and gas producer as for national champions putin has strengthened and prepared gazprom the state controlled gas company transneft oil pipeline monopoly and rosneft the state owned oil giant that is why in 2006 gazprom retained full ownership in the giant shtokman gas field 7 and took a controlling stake in the sakhalin 2 natural gas project in june 2007 it took back bps kovytka gas field and now is behind totals kharyaga oil and gas field

3339302 were killed by their own georgian partners in the peacekeeping forces there is a russian battalion an ossetian battalion and a georgian battalion and all of a sudden the georgians georgian peacekeepers begin shooting their russian colleagues this is of course a war crime i do not rule out that the hague and strasbourg courts and institutions in other cities will be involved in investigating these crimes and this inhuman drama that has been played out
3339303 the actions of georgia have led to deaths among them are russian peacekeepers the situation reached the point that georgian peacekeepers have been shooting at russian peacekeepers now women children and old people are dying in south ossetia most of them are citizens of the russian federation as the president of the russian federation i am obligated to protect lives and the dignity of russian citizens wherever they are those responsible for the deaths of our citizens will be punished

3339331 not at all that was our impartial and probably unanimous judgment we saw attorneys hold back tears and weep alongside their clients we saw judges prosecutors clerks and marshals do their duty sometimes with a heavy heart but always with a particular solemnity not accorded to the common criminals theyre used to encountering
3339332 your honor i am concerned from my attorney client interviews that many of these people are clearly not guilty yet they have no choice but to plead out
3339333 you know i dont agree with any of this or with the way it is being done in fact i ruled in a previous case that to charge somebody with identity theft the person had to at least know of the real owner of the social security number
3339334 as a citizen i want our judges to administer justice not a federal agency when the executive branch forces the hand of the judiciary the result is abuse of power and arbitrariness unworthy of a democracy founded upon the constitutional principle of checks and balances

3339367 it is quite worrying to see the lack of planning people undertake as they approach retirement and its particularly surprising to see how few of todays pensioners sought financial advice
3339368 seeing a financial adviser should be a baseline activity for everyone planning their retirement so that they structure their finances to maximise retirement income from all available sources including pensions savings and investments and equity in their homes if necessary
3339369 its easy to think that when you reach retirement your saving days are over retirement is after all the main reason to save in the first place
3339370 however analysis has shown that a 65 year old professional male can expect to live to 83 years old while further research has shown that people over 50 years old can underestimate how long they live by up to six years
3339371 the best thing before you go or when you are there if your language skills are not what you would want them to be is speak to a uk based international adviser and ask for a recommendation
3339372 most firms have a network of people who are reliable advisers so you can get referrals if they are an international adviser they will be able to look at investment structures that will work in the jurisdiction that you are living within
3339373 people are better off using companies that have lots of offices worldwide as it can be an advantage to seek advice from someone in the local area it gives you the extra safety net
3339374 if i leave my pension in the uk i pay tax when i retire if i transfer it to an aussie fund i dont pay tax when i draw on it also there is australian tax levied on foreign assets so if i leave my fund in the uk i may have to pay tax each year on the growth anyhow clearly this doesnt apply to a domestic asset so if transferred this disappears
3339375 to balance the glitz of this freedom we suggest that a transfer decision is about advice not a transaction people cant make an informed decision without a document in plain english setting out the situation with real numbers pertinent to their circumstances and cognisant of uk and aussie legislation this is what we do
3339376 but i think that a little more of the world has gone nuts

3339381 yeah mommy they call mean names like that and laugh
3339382 do you ever call other kids names when they do something stupid
3339383 ok tiger how about this do grownups ever do stupid stuff you know like maybe they werent thinking quite right
3339384 ok guys one last question do you all think that people who do stupid things but who dont have medically different brains might be considered retarded at times
3339385 we reiterate our support for bolivias unity and territorial integrity
3339386 the people are asking with this outcome that their leaders find a way to reach an accord
3339387 our vote has decreed the death once and for all of a political system from the past century giving way to a new system built on the regions
3339388 involved high stakes betting all bets made in lahore were either collectively sent to india or through karachi to india
3339389 we are concerned that there is a great deal of external inspiration and support we are also concerned and are looking at a mastermind within the country
3339390 clearly there is some kind of organisation we have to find out if that organisation is localised or there is an external group or module operating
3339391 an aligarh court issued non bailable warrant against ratan jalan on charges of criminal breach of trust and cheating following which a police team from aligarh came to the city yesterday and arrested him
3339392 pets need to exercise and they dont have much space in hong kong so we are trying to promote exercise and stimulate owners to exercise their pets
3339393 we will also hold an international conference during that week in which eminent personalities associated with media and entertainment from various countries will be discussing various aspects of the industry especially its contribution to overall economic development of the region
3339394 they would be encouraged to bring out a compendium of information on locations facilities and other assistance for film shootings
3339395 we shall launch a book on the achievements of president musharraf likely before pakistans independence day on august 14
3339396 like minded friends decided to express our support for president musharraf had it been an organised movement more people would have joined us
3339397 i dont have the medicine i dont have the resources

3339400 until not long ago all that oil money was used to benefit the elite
3339401 what we want is to have a society where everyone improves
3339402 i dont think that is quite real life is made of grey tones
3339403 those doctors have had a free education in venezuela so in a way we are subsidising the development of the rich countries
3339404 if we dont have enough freedom and this really begins to be a socialist place like cuba then i will get out of here
3339405 but right now i choose to stay in my country
3339406 if you want money of course its very good to leave the country if you dont if your preferences are about family love friends or whatever maybe you should think about staying
3339407 we are dedicated to bring about a new era in the modern world i e the era of space colonisation and to that end we are training to become astronauts of the future
3339408 in this incident the positive and proactive initiative of the atc controller who on realising that mobile audio communication from the pilot was intermittent quickly switched to texting his instructions instead
3339409 this contributed to the safe resolution of the incident and for such the controller should be commended for his actions

3339411 i have made a decision to end the operation to force the georgian authorities to peace the goals of the operation have been achieved
3339412 the safety of our peacekeeping forces and the civilian population has been established the aggressor has been punished and has suffered significant losses its armed forces are disorganized
3339413 if there are little pockets of opposition and other aggressive manifestations we will make a decision to liquidate them
3339414 the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward resolving this conflict
3339415 passengers hold cisf personnel doing the security checks responsible for the theft but it has been found that the belongings were taken by fellow passengers
3339416 since passengers are in a hurry to reach their destination they dont want to lodge a complaint with the police saying if they get into legal procedures they will miss their flight and their belongings also

3339422 rather than saying its military im calling it utility like the bauhaus
3339423 theres nothing wrong with everyday dressing i design for people
3339424 i knew his line cloak and i thought he was very very talented
3339425 we give something to each other i gave him colors he gave me fantastic tailoring
3339426 i cannot complain i just wanted to do something different and use the expertise and incorporate the heritage its a mixed bag but hopefully it looks good what do i know i think its a challenge for every designer to keep doing the same thing for me its boring i know sometimes it sounds like a cop out from your earlier principles but on the other hand as long as you keep working and doing the things you like who cares
3339427 thousands are good but if you can have five friends you can really count on youre lucky
3339428 barack obama is about to make one of the most important decisions of this campaign choosing a running mate
3339429 you have helped build this movement from the bottom up and barack wants you to be the first to know his choice
3339430 you can also text vp to 62262 to receive a text message on your mobile phone
3339431 any possibility that he would consider issuing a pledge say at the republican convention i will serve one term as president
3339432 chris youre going to have to come to the republican convention to find out whats going to happen there
3339433 if i said i was running for eight years im not sure that would be a vote getter
3339434 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3339435 above all this irony emerges clinton ran on the basis of managerial competence on her capacity as she liked to put it to do the job from day one in fact she never behaved like a chief executive and her own staff proved to be her achilles heel
3339436 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3339437 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and his values
3339438 should go back to making tea for brian mulroney and stay out of serious peoples business
3339439 everything senator mccain has done has been to widen that gap between the richest and most powerful corporations and small businesses
3339440 working families are looking for a leader who will get our economy moving again and obamas continued clinging to the failed tax and spend policies of the past will do exactly the opposite
3339441 to call tom ridge to washington from whatever vacation he is taking get him down there and get him to work
3339442 theres no question the selection of tom ridge as john mccains running mate would make our job harder here
3339443 even with tom ridge on the ticket i believe sen obama could and would carry the state
3339444 la organizaci n mundial de turismo estima que para el a o 2020 china ser la cuarta mayor fuente de turistas del mundo con 100 millones de sus nacionales viajando por el extranjero si m xico dada su condici n de potencia cultural pudiera siquiera captar el 0 1 por ciento significar a que para el a o 2020 podr an viajar a nuestro pa s m s de 100 mil turistas chinos
3339445 los chinos son amantes del shopping les encanta ir al palacio de hierro y a liverpool a comprar ropa les organizamos viajes a los centros comerciales compran un montonal y regresan cargados de maletas enteras
3339446 estoy convencido de que ste es un gran negocio a futuro en cinco a os nos vamos a llevar una sorpresa enorme del mercado chino
3339447 es curioso vienen a ver arqueolog a no les interesa la playa aunque normalmente nuestros tours terminan con dos d as en canc n o playa del carmen pero ni siquiera se ponen el traje de ba o piden mucho ir a teotihuacan a la bas lica de guadalupe al museo de antropolog a y a los museos de diego rivera y frida kahlo el de ellos es un turismo m s cultural que el de los estadunidenses por ejemplo
3339448 apenas nos estamos organizando todav a no traemos grupos pero ya estamos empezando a ver de d nde vamos a traer a los chinos la verdad es que el mercado de los turistas de china est creciendo en todos los mbitos y es un mercado potencial para vender grandes cantidades viajes pienso que si no puedes con ellos pues entonces neteles v ndeles algo
3339449 all government is evil and trying to improve it is largely a waste of time
3339450 we believe any decision at this time on whether he should remain majority leader is premature and wrong
3339451 no no es contra el presidente felipe calder n es contra un centralismo que se ha venido construyendo en los ltimos a os y en el que es preciso dar marcha atr s para impulsar el federalismo
3339452 que en este esfuerzo por definir mejor las facultades y competencias del gobierno federal de los gobiernos estatales de los gobiernos municipales no caigamos en el exceso del efecto pendular que luego de un inaceptable centralismo como mecanismo de organizaci n social para una naci n plural vayamos por efecto de la reacci n a una divisi n que segregue segmente y fragmente a nuestra naci n
3339453 todos tenemos algo que decir y algo que aportar porque s lo de esta manera estaremos construyendo una pol tica social con visi n de estado estaremos distinguiendo lo que es un estado verdaderamente solidario y subsidiario y estaremos dejando de lado seguramente cualquier idea asociada a un estado benefactor que lejos de distinguirse por promover el desarrollo de las partes quede atrapado en el centralismo el paternalismo el populismo

3339461 anybody who wants to beat me up for this they should have at it
3339462 the truth is you cant possibly beat me up more than ive already beaten myself up
3339463 i was taken in by his magnificent rhetoric and now i think hes treacherous
3339464 its an insult greater than i could ever imagine that he would do this to that magnificent family he has
3339465 he was trying to relieve himself of the horror of what he had done almost saying had i known that she was in the last stages of her life i would never have done it
3339466 what that demonstrates is that he had no love for his wife because you dont do that to someone you love he has soiled her
3339467 i dont think that candidates private lives are particularly relevant to how theyll perform in office
3339468 if we rated our presidents by the quality of their private lives youd have to say that nixon and bush are two of the best presidents we ever had
3339469 john edwards knows what the rules are he knew at the time he ran for president that he was having an affair and he should have known that was going to come out it was reckless for him to run for president under those terms i feel very disappointed in him his campaign the judgment he showed
3339470 it would have been better if hed issued an apology and just gone away
3339471 tarnishes the moral credibility hes built through his work on poverty and it also raises questions about his overall judgment
3339472 lusting after girls young enough to be his daughter what a slime bucket

3339501 i am moved and grateful that the president wrote to me there are so many people like me yet she has shown such concern towards me i do hope i can walk into rashtrapati bhavan and meet her
3339502 for the past 15 years my world was full of just pain and helplessness with this crippling disease all i could do was sit or lie down on my bed and take a few faltering painful steps to go to the toilet it was a very depressing state of affairs for my family and me and many times i would wonder what is the point of existing like this
3339503 i also look forward to the day when this brave girl seema is able to walk normally and go about her daily chores with ease she is a highly intelligent sensitive and caring person and deserves all the best in life
3339504 when seema first came to fortis she was bedridden and wheel chair bound and severely depressed because of her compromised quality of life at such a young age the young 37 year old lady weighed only 40 kg her case was complex because she had multiple joint involvement her bones were severely fragile and osteoporotic her joints had lost mobility and were fixed and her muscles were atomic and weak because she had been immobile for many years it was a very challenging and rare case indeed
3339505 i would like to advise anyone who is facing an equally serious situation anywhere in the world to not waste time move with a positive attitude and seek medical help wherever he or she is medical science has made tremendous strides and can be of great help do not let doubts or misgivings stop you from bringing sunshine back into your life

3339521 robert was black the whole time my mom came on the set and she thought it was don cheadle
3339522 to me the most important thing was alpa chino has to give him a beat down and tell him that what hes doing is crazy the whole time

3339524 if were all gonna play ball lets all play ball
3339525 i believe in fairness if we can punch you punch back and funny is funny
3339526 this sort of self important self involved thing seemed funny to me
3339527 i just couldnt figure a way to make that into a movie

3339529 an r rated comedy that satirizes hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters in ridiculous situations
3339530 you go out there and put your best foot forward in terms of what you think youre doing of what you think is the right idea
3339531 if people are accepting it the way that you intended and you feel that from a general audience then stand behind it
3339532 i just hope at this point with whatever little weve done to brand ourselves as entertainers that you give us a little slack
3339533 will provide clarity and certainty to the consultation process under the endangered species act
3339534 i am deeply troubled by this proposed rule which gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3339535 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government this is not the type of legacy this interior department should be leaving for future generations
3339536 clearly thats a case of asking the fox to guard the chicken coop
3339537 a giant caution light that made federal agencies stop and think about the impacts of their actions
3339538 what the bush administration is telling those agencies is they dont have to think about those impacts anymore
3339539 we have to have the ability to put our efforts where theyre needed
3339540 this really says to the agencies this law belongs to all of us
3339541 because it is not possible to link the emissions to impacts on specific listed species such as polar bears
3339542 so we dont inadvertently have the endangered species act seen as a back door to climate change policy that was never ever intended
3339543 clarity on an issue that if it was left broad and ambiguous could be a serious problem for the home building industry here in california
3339544 for home builders clarity in the rules is always always helpful
3339545 encouragement from both sides of the aisle to see if we couldnt bring about steps that would make the endangered species act more effective
3339546 we took into account 30 different variables including age weight diabetes cholesterol high blood pressure whether they exercise smoking and we found that low vitamin d levels independent of all these other risk factors for heart disease predicted an increased risk of dying from any other cause so we found a new risk factor for death
3339547 we also need to prove if we give additional vitamin d will it prevent a heart attack
3339548 this is an interesting report that confirms and extends previous work
3339549 this means the solidarity of five states with the nation that has fallen victim to aggression
3339550 we may say that the russian state has once again shown its face its true face
3339551 we are saddened by that but we must accept the facts of life
3339552 the judges entire analysis of what is tiffanys responsibility with respect to the site versus ebays starts from an incorrect basis
3339553 based solely on their generalized knowledge that trademark infringement might be occurring on their web sites
3339554 the fact of the matter is ebay has created the venue ebay is profiting from the venue ebay absolutely controls the venue
3339555 its ebays obligation once it has knowledge to take the knowledge to investigate and stop the sale of counterfeit merchandise
3339556 tiffanys decision to carry this litigation on after the district courts decision doesnt do anything to combat counterfeiting
3339557 were really talking about taking a look with a very different lens
3339558 when you lose a race like that it motivates me even more to try to swim faster
3339559 i just wanted to be out at the 50 meter point and thats where i was
3339560 i was in open water and it was difficult for the other guys to see me
3339561 i knew park is strong in the last 50 meters
3339562 so i knew i had to be fast and concentrated
3339563 i just tried to swim my own race hes going to go out but i cant let that affect my race strategy
3339564 to be tied for the most olympic golds of all time with those names in olympic history
3339565 the olympics have been around for so many years thats a pretty amazing accomplishment
3339566 i set up an opportunity to have a perfect swim tomorrow
3339567 it might be once in a century you see something like this
3339568 hes not just winning hes absolutely destroying everything its awesome to watch
3339569 its his physical ability its his ability to race its his ability to keep focused to get excited when he needs to and to come down when he needs to come down
3339570 im so glad to have this race behind me because theres so much pressure
3339571 i tried to keep myself as mentally strong as possible
3339572 last year in melbourne at the world championships one swim started it and then swims just started happening one after another after another we had a great morning this morning and hopefully we can set up some more good swims tonight and keep the ball rolling
3339573 it almost felt like less pressure because it wasnt initially my event
3339574 i dont think its necessarily fair what happened but rules are rules and im just doing what im told
3339575 i just wanted to win my heat and set everything up for tomorrow
3339576 just get through that and prepare myself for tomorrow thats the most important thing an afternoon off and its time to just sort of get as rested as i can recover and i probably have to re shave get all of that stuff down

3339613 the first six months of 2008 were in line with expectations but not satisfactory
3339614 our subsidiary affilinet achieved strong sales growth while sales of adlink media were only slightly up on the prior year figure as expected sales in our domain marketing segment sedo were down on the previous year also in the second quarter sedo continues to suffer from negative effects which were already reported in the first quarter of 2008 these effects result from permanent changes in policy and algorithms which our most important partners in the search engine business have made the continuing weakness of the us dollar and the uk pound is also reflected in these figures

3339639 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document as outlined in mr suskinds book
3339640 permission to state the following on his behalf i never received any instruction from then chief ne rob richer or any other officer in my chain of command instructing me to fabricate such a letter further i have no knowledge to the origins of the letter and as to how it circulated in iraq
3339641 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
3339642 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammed atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
3339643 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
3339644 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
3339645 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
3339646 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts by some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
3339647 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
3339648 if they go in the other direction i think theyre probably going to have to start firing people
3339649 george said something like well marine ive got a job for you though you may not like it
3339650 when it was discussed with me i just thought it was incredible a box checking of all outstanding issues in one letter from one guy
3339651 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack
3339652 the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
3339653 after being told that habbush had said there were no wmd bush was frustrated
3339654 why dont they ask him to give us something we can use to help us make our case
3339655 the dia research dates from 1976 and shows the dangers were known about over twenty years ago the soviets used the frequencies and intensities used by mobile phones 1800 mhz and 900 mhz as weapons it is a rule of the intelligence community that you hide things in plain view getting the public to accept microwave mind control weapons which affect their behavior under the guise of mobile phones was a stroke of genius getting the public to pay for these microwave mind control devices so their brains and behavior can be damaged to make them more docile and easy to control was pure diabolical genius
3339656 what happens when the fbi spends millions of dollars targeting an american citizen for an illegal cointelpro operation while perpetrating precedent setting violations of that citizens constitutional rights yet fails to arrest that person the fbi then uses the media to slander the targeted person and coercion to blackmail those around the target including the targets family into keeping silent in regard to the torture they are being subjected to in efforts to drive them to suicide such precedent setting crimes are now being perpetrated against my person by the fbi nsa amp dhs you could be their next victim
3339657 the indigo blue ribbon campaign to promote the awareness of people targeted for mind control amp organized stalking crimes
3339658 what is the us federal government doing using satellites to spy on americans within the privacy of their own homes this has been occurring since long before the 9 11 attacks black operations which were an inside job perpetrated to keep the war on terror open ended so that the illuminati run us federal government can continue to erode our freedoms under the pretext of protecting us from an invisible enemy
3339659 it is illegal amp against its charter for the nsa to spy domestically unless it receives permission from the fisa court to do so and then only if it can prove that the american citizen to be placed under surveillance is in contact with an international terrorist so exactly what is the nsa doing illegally spying on myself and millions of other unwitting americans
3339660 nsa personnel can dial up any individual in the country on the signals lntelligence emf scanning network and the nsas computers will then pinpoint and track that person 24 hours a day the nsa can pick out and track anyone in the u s
3339661 the followings a diagram of the type of mind control software that agencies like the nsa utilize on targets of illegal mind control research any american citizen can be targeted for this satellite based weaponry at any time without their knowledge or consent
3339662 we need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society the purpose is physical control of the mind everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated the individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence but this is only his personal point of view this lacks historical perspective man does not have the right to develop his own mind this kind of liberal orientation has great appeal we must electrically control the brain some day armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain
3339663 consider the damage done to us as a people by the us congress cia fbi dod nsa and dhs alone the biological chemical and electronic warfare that they have subjected so many of us to the illegal and humiliating nsa satellite spying of us within the privacy of our own domiciles the inhumanity of their mind control torture the complete manipulation of the us economy through the illuminati controlled federal reserve bank and irs and the treasonous crimes committed by them through the improperly ratified and unconstitutional federal reserve act the us federal governments usurpation and manipulation of the us media through the cias operation mockingbird the abject treason of the attacks on 9 11 and one can only arrive at the following conclusion only a population that is either extremely ignorant of the facts or masochistic would ever allow for a government which is such anathema to exist within their country
3339664 so to begin i want to state the most basic of all facts about brainwashing in the entire history of man no one has ever been brainwashed and realized or believed that he had been brainwashed
3339665 nothing would warrant the monitoring of individuals every minute habit 24 7 unless theyre us intelligence doing illegal inhumane testing
3339666 the most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed
3339667 the extensive crimes against humanity which the us federal government controlled by the privately held federal reserve bank has perpetrated against the american people which includes the crime of menticide are so far reaching that in most instances its beyond their comprehension the people of this planet must stop thinking in groups amp starting thinking for themselves the illuminati has us convinced that we should be fighting eachother as in making war on other countries when it is the illuminati which operates through our banking systems amp governments whom we should be working to destroy
3339668 these guys are professional liars who have raised selected memory loss to an art form
3339669 with the creation of this website ive done the best i can to document the nsas illegal spying and mind control operations which adversely affect myself and myriad other americans in the present day there are also citizens from many other countries reporting this same phenomenon
3339670 as for the 9 11 attacks with the satellite spy technology that the nsa has incorporated into its echelon spy system there is absolutely no way that this agency would not have known about the attacks on 9 11 before hand if osama bin ladin was really behind these attacks as we have been told the nsa could have immediately disabled him through the use of directed energy weapons technology bin laden like lee harvey oswald was nothing more than a lightening rod used to cover up yet another major us intelligence black operation perpetrated against the american people

3339731 recent escalation in military engagement between russia and georgia poses a threat to certain key oil and gas pipelines which transit georgia
3339732 there have been no deliberate attempts to damage that pipeline
3339733 we think it any attack would be counter active even though it can happen in a conflict
3339734 demonstrate that it is a volatile region it is a crucial region for getting caspian oil to consumer markets
3339735 with negligible domestic oil production unlike some of its caspian neighbours georgias significance to global oil and gas markets is as a transit corridor
3339736 threat of an attack on the btc baku tblisi ceyhan pipeline poses the bigger risk to oil markets it is clear that more generally georgia is a key energy transit hub in the caucasus region and a country of significant strategic importance to energy markets
3339737 the outage on the btc pipeline and recent hostilities in the caucasus highlight the potentially precarious nature of pipeline energy supplies in the region
3339738 with the btc currently closed disruption to georgian energy infrastructure further limits the possibility of getting caspian oil and gas to markets
3339739 renewed flows through georgia expected from september could be further delayed if the line is damaged during the russia georgia conflict
3339740 along the same corridor runs the south caucasus gas pipeline a branch of this pipeline continues through to the russian port of tuapse transiting the region of abkhazia another georgian area affected by separatist action where russian troops are reportedly also being mobilised
3339741 total products leaving georgian ports typically average 50 000 70 000 barrels per day

3339744 fue un error no fortalecer la mesa de di logo
3339745 el viernes vamos a estar sintetizando la voluntad de los maestros se agotaron los plazos y el gobierno deb a hacer una propuesta urgente de aumento salarial a los maestros no ha sido as y en ese sentido dijimos que advert amos un escenario de conflicto qued clara nuestra voluntad de sentarnos a discutir y no ha habido una propuesta concreta
3339746 no s lo que no hay una oferta el gobierno plantea que va a ser reci n en agosto para ser abonada en octubre el segundo problema es que este mes no tuvimos la posibilidad de discutir cifras porque el gobierno se ha negado
3339747 creemos que es un error no fortalecer la mesa de di logo eso conspira contra la posibilidad de solucionar los conflictos siempre en una negociaci n uno nunca se lleva todo lo que aspira pero tiene que haber una posibilidad de que las partes se muevan unos mil metros de su posici n recordemos que desde el 8 de julio fecha del paro hasta ahora no hubo ninguna propuesta
3339748 s creo que vamos a camino a una medida de fuerza la modalidad no la puedo precisar porque se plantear n distintas mociones pero m s all de la medida creo que no hay ninguna duda de que estamos ante un escenario de plan de lucha y eso se da ante la imposibilidad de que se generara una mesa de negociaci n seria
3339749 si se decreta un paro pasa que los chicos no van a tener clases y eso es una situaci n que es preocupante y no es positivo hemos trabajado muy fuerte y vamos a seguir haci ndolo para que esto no ocurra no podemos manejar una realidad de deterioro de muchas d cadas en la provincia en el aspecto educativo y de una fractura fuerte como hemos tenido con el tema del campo como lo ha padecido la provincia en esta coyuntura
3339750 apelamos a la razonabilidad y al buen criterio agreg rasino creo que hemos mucho en estos meses el paro es una situaci n no agradable pero podemos seguir conversando y lo vamos a seguir haciendo esto es una coyuntura que debemos superar

3339760 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen
3339761 lin miaoke was the best in this and yang peiyis voice was the most outstanding
3339762 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3339763 this is like a voice over for a cartoon character
3339764 i can understand why they picked the prettier girl they need to maintain a certain aesthetic beauty during the opening ceremonies this situation is not so bad especially since it gives two people an opportunity to shine rather than just one
3339765 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation
3339766 ive never played singles at the olympics so this has been really cool for me
3339767 every time i walk out there its like im playing in my match but at the same time i have the whole u s team on my side its good i really like that feeling
3339768 obviously its a long ways away but the third round makes it closer im really excited for both of us to be playing really well for the u s
3339769 its hard to train for singles and always dealing with swelling ive just really been playing careful with it i really wanted to be here in whatever capacity it was and it became painfully obvious to me that role was doubles i was very happy to accept that and move forward
3339770 but with the time difference im still waking up like at 5 in the morning so its good i like the early matches
3339771 my way of improving on it is to keep it up

3339784 hay dos v as de soluci n del problema mirar atr s donde no la encontraremos o volver la mirada al futuro e intentar encontrar all una soluci n
3339785 primero el retorno de todas las tropas georgianas a sus posiciones iniciales de emplazamiento y la desmilitarizaci n parcial de esas unidades segundo la firma de un documento vinculante sobre el no uso de la fuerza que es en lo que est trabajando la parte francesa

3339829 the concept of the shoes is absolutely fantastic and perfect for the summer you get two pairs of shoes in one
3339830 for me truth is the sovereign principle which includes numerous other principles this truth is not only truthfulness in word but truthfulness in thought also and not only the relative truth of our conception but the absolute truth the eternal principle that is god
3339831 in fact what i have caught is only the faintest gleam of that mighty effulgence but this much i can say with assurance as a result of all my experiments that a perfect vision of truth can only follow a complete realization of ahimsa

3339834 non possession is allied to non stealing a thing not originally stolen must nevertheless be classified as stolen property if we possess it without needing it possession implies provision for the future a seeker after truth a follower of the law of love cannot hold anything against tomorrow god never stores for the morrow he never creates more than what is strictly needed for the moment if therefore we repose faith in his providence we should rest assured that he will give us every day our daily bread meaning everything that we require
3339835 this does not mean that if one has wealth it should be thrown away and wife and children should be turned out of doors it simply means that one must give up attachment of these things and dedicate ones all to god and make use of his gifts to serve him only

3339841 we even had to pass a special law in the congress just a few weeks ago to allow student prayer groups the same access to school rooms after classes that a young marxist society would already enjoy
3339842 if a state refused to let religious groups use facilities open to others then it would demonstrate not neutrality but hostility toward religion the establishment clause does not license government to treat religion and those who teach or practice it as subversive of american ideals
