6490009 we havent got 24 hour policing in arrowtown and dont need it but weve got more bars per head of population than a lot of other places
6490010 our philosophy is come to arrowtown and enjoy yourself but dont cause problems
6490011 its a preventative measure we are not spying on people but we are able to use it as a tool if there are problems
6490012 but its pretty quiet and we like to keep it that way
6490013 it was well worth giving it a hit and we made a really good effort
6490014 even if you might think there is going to be a change in government there will still be a policy no doubt about it
6490015 we should be able to get the point of obligation to the farm level it might take a bit of a fight to get government there but i think we can get them there
6490016 the reality is that farming is in an unfortunate position food and fibre producers are being targeted yet there is little they can do at this point beyond reducing output
6490017 reducing farm emissions is more difficult than was hoped and the ets could simply result in a tax on the food and fibre sectors

6490028 i recommend that women consult their doctors to talk about the risk and benefits of taking hormone therapy before commencing treatment

6490054 froh und gl cklich dass die aktion gelungen ist dass sie es geschafft haben ein zeichen zu setzen und das die olympischen spiele als propagandainstrument die proteste nicht berdecken
6490055 als deutscher staatsb rger kann ich zu derart eklatanten menschenrechtsverletzungen wie sie in tibet geschehen nicht schweigen

6490072 but then the batshit crazy came and made everything hilarious
6490073 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
6490074 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
6490075 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
6490076 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
6490077 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
6490078 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
6490079 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
6490080 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
6490081 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
6490082 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
6490083 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
6490084 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
6490085 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
6490086 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
6490087 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
6490088 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
6490089 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
6490090 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
6490091 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since

6490093 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
6490094 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
6490095 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
6490096 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
6490097 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
6490098 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
6490099 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
6490100 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
6490101 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
6490102 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you

6490104 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really

6490119 richard your story is incorrect ron paul has essentially accepted the nomination we intend to keep him on the ballot if mayor bloomberg does the same well do the same we have had conversations with the constitution party and in fact put them on the ballot for president in 2004 in virginia by collecting about 16 000 signatures now we are calling for a unity alliance with the major minor parties to put bloomberg paul on the ballot nationwide in the next two weeks

6490136 you can see a lot of difference in the students faces
6490137 the students are good here without help but we see that our government cares about us its been a month and a half since they came to our school and asked what we needed and since then we have seen good progress
6490138 when the taliban was in power it was illegal for girls to go to school but we never forgot how important it is to educate all afghan children
6490139 this school used to be housing for russian pilots but the government of afghanistan helped us make it usable as a place of education
6490140 a lot of families cant even afford to buy paper or a pen for their children
6490141 we dont have a lot of money but i see a bright future for schools in this area what matters most is the students are interested in studying and learning and the people here see the value in education

6490145 i went into this race very positive but even in the first lap i lacked energy
6490146 my body was battling to move and when it came to the last 100 i could feel the tension in my body there was no movement
6490147 when it came to the last 30 i could feel i was finished two guys passed me and then im out so i just gave up
6490148 today i was feeling much better my body was not so painful i thought i would be able to run but i was flat
6490149 i saw the seven next to me and i thought i had made it as a fastest qualifier
6490150 my game plan was to go out with lisa dobriskey and just try to stay behind i think we are similar athletes but i lost a bit of concentration when she kicked and she was gone immediately
6490151 i will definitely not spend more time on the track i will be going back to road im not a pure 1 500m athlete i dont have the speed but ive got endurance from the track i think next year you will see me more on the road again ive tried it specialising on track before after the previous olympic games when i just missed out on qualifying for the team and it didnt work for me
6490152 the rain affected everyones performance there were no automatic qualifiers im really not too pleased with my performances im not making this an excuse as i wouldnt have made it an excuse if i had thrown 80m but i have battled with flu since monday
6490153 i wish i could do a lot better but i will see what happens with the next group
6490154 we were looking good but we just didnt get the baton through the last changeover
6490155 all i can say is this 95 of what has been written about this incident is inaccurate inflammatory exaggerated taken out of context and just plain unfair furthermore the accusing parties have been behaving like children flinging baseless lies recklessly breaking the law violating copyrights willynilly posting cowardly anonymous crank rants all over the internet and disregarding common decency courtesy respect and the first amendment along the way

6490168 se introduciamo la politica nel consiglio rischiamo di richiamarci ad un modello autoritario ovverosia quello fascista dove la magistratura non e indipendente dal potere politico e quindi non tutti i cittadini sono garantiti allo stesso modo
6490169 la corte europea potrebbe avere delle riserve nel senso che alcuni principi della costituzione come quello di uguaglianza non sono modificabili e quindi possibile che si apra una discussione molto seria a livello di corte di giustizia europea proprio sulla compatibilit di questo modello con i principi della convenzione europea
6490170 non dobbiamo dimenticare che il sistema giudiziario attuale che garantisce lautonomia della magistratura stato scritto sulla base delle vicende storiche del 48 i giudici in passato obbedivano al governo fascista la scelta di una magistratura indipendente che si governa da sola e stata fatta sulla base di quella esperienza

6490277 are playing in consolidating security and stability and resisting the armed groups seeking to undermine stability in the city
6490278 trying to damage the honesty and neutrality of the asayish force which is keen to maintain security with the utmost professionalism and in accordance with the law by making false accusations against it and casting doubt on its honesty
6490279 the fabricated accusations being deliberately spread here and there about the performance of the asayish force its loyalty and its role in kirkuk are baseless and everyone can ascertain this security organs honesty and neutrality by asking the american forces deployed in kirkuk and also the police commander
6490280 the asayish forces tasks are confined only to the collection of intelligence information about the armed groups practicing terrorism in the city and its suburbs and handing over this information to the parties concerned with the arrest of the armed terrorist elements
6490281 asayish force is not involved in the arrests and this forces units did not and will not arrest anyone in kirkuk because this is not their task
6490282 anyone who makes these fabricated and baseless accusations against the asayish force must present evidence of what he says because making false accusations is easy but proving them is the criteria we as the asayish force in kirkuk challenge any person making these accusations against us to come forward even with a single piece of evidence of what he is claiming or bring the name of any person arrested by the asayish force
6490283 the citys security committee chaired by the governor of kirkuk includes in its membership representatives of all the races and acts in cooperation and coordination with all the security organs in the governorate in addition to the iraqi armys two brigades which are deployed in the city and its outskirts
6490284 supervises the performance of the citys security organs in addition to organizing and following up the security affairs in other words no security organ can or has the authority to carry out any security task without the higher security committees knowledge and supervision therefore the accusations against the security organs and reports about their performance are absolutely baseless
6490285 the security situation in kirkuk is at present stable in a very good way and the credit for this goes to all the security organs that have joined forces including the asayish force which is playing an important role in controlling security
6490286 the arrest orders or warrants are issued by the judiciary in accordance with the law and the security organs which are the executive parties implement the judicial orders there were absolutely no raids on citizens houses except with an official order from the judge and in accordance with the law the security committee watches very closely the security situations and the security organs performance in the city and it has not received any complaints from the citizens so far

6490363 mr campbell states that the discovery was made in consequence of the drifting of the sand showing a deposit of rust on the surface and on digging to the depth of about 15 inches he found two skeletons a little apart with their heads towards the east
6490364 although it seems a strange thing to us that a man should be supposed to have need of his smithy tools in the other world this feeling was quite in accordance with the faith that foretold the need of weapons as the viking who was laid in the sand hills of islay took with him his sword and spear his axe and shield so he necessarily required his smithy tools to keep them in repair
6490365 the asa faith promised a place in odins great hall valhalla to all men wounded by arms or slain in battle spears supported its ceiling it was roofed with shields and coats of mail adorned its benches it was the perpetual pastime of its inmates to fight and slay each other every day to be revived again before evening and to ride home in joyful company to valhalla there to be refreshed with the boars feast and the mead served by the valkyriar not only was the viking of the heathen time supposed to take with him to valhalla all that was buried with him but whatever he had hid in the earth during his lifetime
6490366 i may remark that the island of islay has yielded a larger number of burials of the norse viking time than any other district of scotland the island of westray in orkney alone excepted we have already in the museum a pair of tortoise brooches from ballinaby they were found not far from the site of these two graves under a large standing stone the bauta stein of the norse grave mound and presented in may 1788 by colin campbell esq of ballinaby a worthy predecessor of the ballinaby to whom we owe the presentation of these interesting relics to night

6490389 global demand for all types of energy has risen steeply and supplies of finite resources like oil and gas are under intense pressure
6490390 the world is experiencing an energy shock of a kind not seen since the early 1970s but which is likely to have more profound and lasting consequences this is what lies behind much of the dramatic increase in wholesale energy prices we have experienced

6490394 no they chose mark olson with the greatest regard for mark olsons legal history its just that everyone knew that he was an innocent man mark olsons legal history was in the forefront of the convention there is no way a soul voted without regard to that history people support mark olson because he is an innocent man with extraordinary integrity people inside the district here have tremendous respect for his integrity frankly i think his integrity was proven to folks in sd16 as he never tried to hide anything during his case he was open and honest and still is
6490395 a court appointed attorney said olson preferred not to enter a plea to the charges
6490396 who says the government is giving legitimacy to hezbollah these are just ravings conjured up by the israelis to tarnish lebanons image
6490397 its based on exaggerations by mossad and the israeli intelligence services
6490398 the moment the lebanese government confers legitimacy on hezbollah it must understand that the entire lebanese state will be a target in the same way that all of
6490399 the city of denver has been working to make sure everything is in tip top shape for all the visitors coming to town for the democratic national convention and now a local salon is helping in that effort
6490400 it seems to be a first dont move the homeless clean them up that was the work of one salon and the recipients didnt even seem to care if the democrats were coming to town slys salon at 17th and grant was offering free haircuts to the homeless monday
6490401 history will not judge us kindly if we sacrifice four generations of americans because of the folly of one
6490402 if there is a political polar opposite of a mothers day resolution it is trying to regulate how americans drive speier has done just that with her very first bill which would set a national speed limit of 60 mph in cities and 65 mph in rural areas
6490403 its like guns dont mess with my car my harley or my gun
6490404 i know its not going to make me a lot of friends but i didnt go there for that reason
6490405 it might seem like an uphill climb in view of americas car culture but speier attacks it with relish she notes the relatively small differences in travel times between 70 mph and 60 mph against the potential savings of more than 2 000 lives and the reduction in this nations carbon footprint and dependence on imported oil speier contends the lower speed limit and corresponding drop in fuel consumption would have far more near term impact on gas prices than the other plans offshore drilling alternative fuel incentives that have been kicking around in the house in the larger picture speier goes back to the subject of the speech she made on her first day in congress the war in iraq which has claimed 4 500 u s lives and has consumed more than 10 billion a month
6490406 the conventions provide a big national spotlight for both candidates a chance to have the stage when voters are actually paying attention
6490407 it is an incredible opportunity to tell the american people your vision for the country and what you will do as president and that can change the dynamics of the race
6490408 they are finished with just telling voters about themselves now they have to show voters they are ready to be president
6490409 the members on this site have joined for a specific reason they arent just looking for a soul mate they are looking for like minded adults who want to fulfill their sexual fantasies

6490413 the polyketal microparticles we developed are simply a vehicle to get the drugs inside the body to the diseased area as quickly as possible
6490414 the major advantage to using these polyketals to deliver drugs is that they degrade into biocompatible compounds that dont accumulate in a patients tissue or cause additional inflammation
6490415 delivering proteins inside microparticles has been limited because getting the protein into the microparticles required organic solvents that frequently destroyed the proteins
6490416 to overcome this problem we developed a method of simply immobilizing the protein on the surface of the microparticles
6490417 this is by far the most exciting cast we have in over 13 years of shooting live action movies for command amp conquer
6490418 the caliber of the performances we received both individually and collectively have really raised the storytelling bar for the franchise we are really excited that we will be delivering such a high quality production that is on par with movies and television shows
6490419 i think video games are one of the new frontiers for actors and using live action is just another way to connect more easily to the gamer rather than cg or animation techniques

6490442 la pr ctica de los consejeros viola la ley ind gena 19 253 y los principios ticos al asumir posiciones vitalicias y patrimoniales sobre la conadi
6490443 nosotros queremos que el gobierno le d una soluci n a los problemas de tierra que tenemos en diferentes comunidades tambi n rechazamos la actuaci n de estos consejeros que est n imponiendo su derecho afirmando que el trabajo que ellos hacen es verdadero nosotros decimos que el gobierno est buscando un medio para buscar soluciones en estas comunidades
6490444 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6490445 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6490446 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6490447 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6490448 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6490449 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

6490451 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
6490452 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
6490453 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6490454 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6490455 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6490456 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6490457 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6490458 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras

6490484 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6490485 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6490486 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6490487 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6490488 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6490489 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6490490 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6490491 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6490492 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6490493 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6490494 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6490495 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6490496 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6490497 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos

6490499 theres no way to trace the source of this kind of injury with 100 accuracy of course but we believe it was seriously strained in june as a direct result of carrying the team on his shoulders
6490500 the weight of the club in recent years has been carried by david ortiz manny ramirez and josh beckett but with ortiz on the dl beckett struggling and manny pretty much going on strike june was a tough month for us drew really picked us up literally i guess

6490503 good for pj or whatever his name is for stepping up and im sorry hes hurt but theres nothing i can do and i really dont think i have any culpability

6490520 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6490521 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6490522 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6490523 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6490524 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6490525 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6490526 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6490527 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6490528 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6490529 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6490530 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6490531 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6490532 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6490533 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6490534 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6490535 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6490536 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6490537 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6490538 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6490539 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

6490543 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6490544 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6490545 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6490546 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6490547 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6490548 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6490549 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6490550 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6490551 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6490552 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6490553 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6490554 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6490555 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6490556 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6490557 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6490558 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6490559 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6490560 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6490561 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6490562 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6490563 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6490564 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6490565 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

6490568 it is hard to imagine what management system creates such
6490569 i think it is pretty impressive interesting and a quite different track than we are used to having on the calendar you can have maybe some corners which seem to be like monaco but some very different corners very long straights which even can be similar to bahrain for example i think it is very nice it will be very very dirty tomorrow because you can see that the asphalt is very very slippery and dirty but i think it will be ok i think it will be nice i like the city so hopefully we can have a nice race for us but also for the people
6490570 for sure we need to look forward and we need to look to the next seven races we know we still have 70 points in front of us and we need to do our best to recover for sure if you look back it would have been a great moment to win the last race but sometimes this sport is like that the most important thing is that we are very competitive as i mentioned before even with the qualifying i would have been able to fight for the pole because the car was great i didnt do a good lap which is why i was not able to fight for the pole but in the race we showed our performance we showed great performance good speed good pace we showed that we are there which is the most important thing
6490571 it was a manufacturing problem of the piece and you cannot do anything we have never had this problem except at that particular moment so theres nothing that can be done about that
6490572 i was inspired to race in mme this year because of two reasons
6490573 angeline i have been saying that i will loose weight since i was a little girl i am already 23 years old if i do not do this now i will never do it down the road when time has passed me by
6490574 so far it is nice warm and sunny the circuit looks good but obviously we need to wait until we get into the rhythm of the weekend to understand what kind or what type of circuit it is as we dont know much about it but it looks pretty good very well organised and obviously the atmosphere seems great because we are in spain and for sure we will have a lot of spanish supporters
6490575 i love it i think the facility and the track the surface the asphalt is all fantastic i mean well prepared very very nice
6490576 i think it is pretty impressive interesting i think it is a pretty different track than we are used to having on the calendar you can have maybe some corners which seem to be like monaco but some very different corners very long straights which even can be similar to bahrain for example i think it is very nice it will be very very dirty tomorrow because you can see that the asphalt is very very slippery and dirty but i think it will be ok i think it will be nice i like the city very nice so hopefully we can have a nice race for us but also for the people
6490577 first of all it is great to be here in valencia i had a race here in gp2 in 2006 but this is really the first time apart from the launch last year for vodafone
6490578 esto es una provocaci n inaceptable en un estado democr tico
6490579 es muy distinto venir aqu al lugar mismo donde est n ocurriendo los hechos y constatar que la denuncias son absolutamente efectivas esta situaci n no es tolerable en un estado democr tico
6490580 es una provocaci n inaceptable esta presencia pr cticamente militar con tanquetas micro cascos subametralladoras fusiles es algo que jam s hab a visto en mis tres per odos que llevo como parlamentario y como presidente de la comisi n de derechos humanos

6490582 no queremos m s que la justicia militar resuelva los casos que involucre a la polic a y a los mapuche todos sabemos cual es el resultado al final siempre se protege a carabineros y los mapuche tienen que pagar como culpables eso es una deuda que el gobierno que la c mara de diputados tiene que cambiar no es posible que esto contin e

6490584 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6490585 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6490586 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6490587 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6490588 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

6490590 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6490591 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6490592 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6490593 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

6490596 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6490597 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6490598 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6490599 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6490600 the start of school is my favorite time of the year because we are bursting with optimism about the coming year
6490601 as state superintendent i have grown very weary of no child left behinds all or nothing strategy you can tell my generation but its like asking michael jordan to score 100 percent when he gets the basketball
6490602 lessons were loaded on the phones and they could text message professionals for help
6490603 but i think its a wave of the future because that cell phone is a favorite tool of theirs we need to look for ways to make the phone an instructional tool not an instructional distraction one day when you come to jones county to teach youll be issued the keys to your room and a gizmo with every instructional thing you need
6490604 everyone in this room has the power to help students reach their dreams
6490605 my challenge for you this year is for you to give your students something to talk about 10 years 50 years from now give north carolina a reason to talk about jones county

6490615 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6490616 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6490617 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6490618 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6490619 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6490620 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6490621 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis

6490623 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6490624 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6490625 97 of our microsoft employee visitors come in from google search
6490626 this team has inherited the tag of inconsistency but i dont think thats fair
6490627 we still have a long way to go as a team and its only our fourth game of the competition its a long competition and upsets are already happening so thats a reality check for us
6490628 my first game for otago was against southland down there and we lost so i know how hard it will be
6490629 its a long way from home and very cold and they are playing good rugby
6490630 were not worried about playing there if we play the way we have been playing at mount smart we should be well capable of getting the win
6490631 its important to carry on the form we have at home and take that overseas we fell off the horse the week after we beat leaders melbourne when we lost to souths
6490632 one game at a time has served the warriors well in their current form spurt with six wins in seven games including the scalps of high flying melbourne brisbane and the cronulla sharks last saturday
6490633 we dont want to worry about the ladder said henderson
6490634 we just have to go and get the win then well have a look at the table
6490635 theyve got a really strong team which can grind out wins when the going gets tough they can stick it out said henderson
6490636 we need to go for 80 minutes to have any chance of winning
6490637 their pack goes forward all day and we have to shut that down and cut off the space for centres mark gasnier and matt cooper
6490638 it was a real good stepping stone for me going over there so young i had to grow up living in a different country on my own not just on the field but off the field as well
6490639 i played a lot of games in top grade which gave me a lot of experience to come back here and do a good job
6490640 i always work on little areas that i want to improve on to get the best out of myself
6490641 i put it down to how much you want it i was dying for an opportunity in the nrl and believed that i was capable of playing pretty well
6490642 im happy with the way im going and the way the team is going i couldnt ask for much more at the moment
6490643 there would be taranaki away taranaki at home taranaki off and taranaki on and a taranaki on is a bloody hard team to beat and thats usually what every team is like when they play a canterbury side
6490644 if they can beat canterbury theyll be happy and we wouldnt want it any other way
6490645 we set ourselves a really high standard and try to get to it each week and if a team wants to try and bring us down thats a real motivating factor for us
6490646 im actually really happy with the way were tracking at the moment our gain line in the sense of getting past the advantage line on first and second phase has been really high and it helps when youve got strong runners like centre adam whitelock
6490647 im feeling pretty good myself and when youve got guys around you who are playing well its pretty easy to play well yourself im enjoying the role ive got in the team at the moment playing at 12 and the style were playing under pens rob penney and hags john haggart
6490648 the boys are starting to gel a bit more now and i think that if we can bring the attitude we brought against auckland every week well be pretty hard to beat
6490649 its really hard to know if youve brought it until the night we can prepare really well all week which we have this week and still not perform that well in the weekend
6490650 i dont really know what it is we just need that spark and its down to each individual to find it
6490651 so far it is nice warm and sunny the circuit looks good but obviously we need to wait until we get into the rhythm of the weekend to understand what kind or what type of circuit it is as we dont know much about it but it looks pretty good very well organised and obviously the atmosphere seems great because we are in spain and for sure we will have a lot of spanish supporters
6490652 i love it i think the facility and the track the surface the asphalt is all fantastic i mean well prepared very very nice the only thing i dont like is that the policemen keep on telling me to turn right my hotel is a five minute walk from here and it takes me half an hour as they tell me to go to barcelona and come back so thats the only thing i dont think they are very well prepared apart from that the whole situation inside of the track is pretty nice
6490653 i hope by sunday it will take me only 20 minutes
6490654 i think it is pretty impressive interesting i think it is a pretty different track than we are used to having on the calendar you can have maybe some corners which seem to be like monaco but some very different corners very long straights which even can be similar to bahrain for example i think it is very nice it will be very very dirty tomorrow because you can see that the asphalt is very very slippery and dirty but i think it will be ok i think it will be nice i like the city very nice so hopefully we can have a nice race for us but also for the people
6490655 first of all it is great to be here in valencia i had a race here in gp2 in 2006 but this is really the first time apart from the launch last year for vodafone mclaren mercedes into the city for me and it is a beautiful place i think they have done a fantastic job in building the place up it has got a great hotel and the track looks incredible i think it looks pretty awesome so i am looking forward to getting out on it tomorrow
6490656 i think the team is doing a very good job this year we start pretty well and we have always improved the car the team is keeping on pushing the development work so i am confident that before the end of the season we can do some good results there are some circumstances and some circuits where we are extremely competitive like it was in hungary and magny cours and some others maybe we suffer a bit more but nevertheless i think we will always fight for top 10 in qualifying and our aim is always to score points at every race obviously our target will be finishing fourth in the constructors championship
6490657 yeah even here we always have some new bits they are already concentrating on next years car development but they are still pushing on this years car as obviously the fight for fourth in the constructors championship is very tight we would like to finish fourth
6490658 we have a contract in place so we believe we can stay together for next year
6490659 i think in terms of pure developments aerodynamic and mechanical thats it but we have to optimise everything that we brought to hungary and before we have new little things in place we had a new rear suspension for hungary but unfortunately we couldnt rig test it before because of lack of time and in these two weeks we could see that there was a big margin for improvement we are expecting that to work better here and the spirit is good because although the preparation for next year is already in place people are working very very hard with the tools that we have in hand to improve the car i am definitely looking forward to the end of the season with the tracks that are coming on as we can score points
6490660 i think the team is definitely talking to fernando but thats the question mark i have never been so enthusiastic about my whole situation with the team i left ferrari because i didnt have the freedom to do what i wanted to do i have that at honda but i still have not had the car to perform and i am waiting for that chance what can i say but honestly the day that i feel that i am slower than my first race is the day i will call it off and stop the conversations are there and i am talking to the team i am talking to all the teams i want to be racing
6490661 yeah for sure we need to look forward and we need to look to the next seven races we know we still have 70 points in front of us and we need to do our best to recover for sure if you look back it would have been a great moment to win the last race but sometimes this sport is like that and we need to look forward the most important thing is that we are very competitive as i mentioned before even with the qualifying i would have been able to fight for the pole because the car was great i didnt do a good lap which is why i was not able to fight for the pole but in the race we showed our performance we showed great performance good speed good pace we showed that we are there which is the most important thing it can be very important for the next races
6490662 yeah i think so if you look at q2 i did a great lap i was a little bit in traffic and i didnt do a great lap in q3 and you know that if you dont do everything right with the big competition that we have with mclaren maybe you cannot start on pole i lost the possibility to start on pole because i didnt do a great lap but i was quite happy to start third instead of second as it gave me the chance to fight
6490663 i cant remember saying that but my guess is as good as yours i think we are all pushing very very hard its a closer season than it was last year i think all the teams are perhaps pushing even more to the edge and thats where you really see mistakes starting to happen this year there are lots of opportunities to make mistakes and there are lots of unknowns we come to new circuits lots of different things with the car its nothing new but last year for sure last year we had i was looking at my results from last year for the first nine or 12 races it was quite unreal who knows we might have that another year but i think this year everyone has pretty much the same sort of run especially us guys at the front
6490664 not really i think the tyres were very similar obviously i had to change tyres at that time so i think i did something like 30 laps or so on the softer tyre but it held together quite well for me and if anything i was even more comfortable on that tyre than i was on the prime
6490665 yes for me i would definitely be looking forward to doing that i just want to send out my heartfelt thoughts and best wishes to all the families and to all the people in spain i think its a tragedy i was really sad to hear it had happened were in a beautiful country in a beautiful city i just hope that doesnt stall our weekend i hope we are able to move on and do the country proud
6490666 i think last year we had a similar accident in brazil and it was a disaster it was so sad as lewis said i give 100 percent support to the people because we are here for sport and there are so many important things apart from sport which are the lives of these people and its a very sad moment i think all of us need to do everything we can to help these people
6490667 for me ive not spoken to my engineers about it that was the last race you might want to ask them if you do a press conference with them but for me it was a tyre failure it was just one of those things a little bit unfortunate but i dont think they really found the exact cause of it
6490668 no definitely not we had a completely different problem which maybe you can have once every ten years it was a manufacturing problem of the piece and you cannot do anything we have never had this problem except at that particular moment so theres nothing that can be done about that
6490669 well i did have a look and its difficult to comment at the moment because we dont know exactly the speed in certain corners but i must say its a safe circuit anyway and so far i can see that they have done a pretty good job but its probably still a bit too early to judge
6490670 its very similar to melbourne in a way because you have limited space on a road circuit i think its nicely done obviously if you have problems in turns nine and ten which is the bridge if a car parked there i think you would have to stop the race because its not even a safety car issue you would have to take the car away and bring trucks onto the bridge it might be a bit of an issue but i think so far as jarno said we have to really understand what is the speed of the cars and the only corner that we were concerned about as a team was turn one because you dont have a lot of run off in that turn but apart from that it looks ok to me
6490671 it looks ok we just need to run and see exactly how it is when you are in the car i think especially if you have good grip from the asphalt it should be ok if you dont have really good grip the run off areas are smaller than you think so we need to run and see
6490672 i think in turkey it was more about my driving style but i dont think it was the case in hungary
6490673 whether or not you are losing points which was already the key since the first race it seems to be that all of us have lost important points this year i think the key will be to be consistent which was already the key since the beginning of the first race which everybody was saying it doesnt change anything
6490674 there are clearly well worked out examples where microevolutionary changes can be traced back to cis regulatory changes
6490675 i think we are on the threshold of a very exciting time
6490676 this decision was not taken lightly first bristol somerset and avon held back on reviewing fares for as long as possible
6490677 i have been at bradford for eight years and a professional for 15 and i have thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it but the old body is telling me to give it away
6490678 joe has probably been up there with robbie paul as the most significant overseas signing the club has ever made
6490679 his presence is simply immense and there will be a whole host of players who will be glad to see the back of joe vagana so they dont have to play against him
6490680 i am just going to head back to new zealand and contemplate life after rugby set up home and get back into the swing of things
6490681 im rapt its something ive waited for for a while and its finally come the way the boys have stepped up from manawatu and on to otago and auckland theyve set a high benchmark and i just want to fit in
6490682 we do a lot of three on threes and franksys great he always brings a competitive edge and youve got to get in there and match it
6490683 campbells just world class so you dont need to say much more and then theres crockzilla crockett the crockzilla is always good at keeping you on your toes
6490684 i rate crocky as one of the most destructive looseheads in the country and if i can match him up at training then what better benchmark
6490685 thats one of the good things about working alongside crocky and c j theyre more than happy to put down a few three on threes and teach me loosehead
6490686 its important to be able to play both and crusaders and tasman prop ben franks is a good example of that during the super 14 he was able to come in and play both sides at the drop of a hat
6490687 i think you do have to be a bit weird and campbell johnstone would be a good example of that i really enjoy the banter and obviously i havent played npc yet but at club level its great
6490688 theres some old heads around the comp and you chew each others ear off a bit and then laugh about it after the game
6490689 its a different club to be involved in and great to be involved in
6490690 it works both ways and if the scrum is no good theyll let us know about it
6490691 it was a big wake up call for me what happened
6490692 i got over it and grew up because i had to i let everybody down not just myself so i wanted to try and put things right
6490693 were absolutely loving it weve settled really well my contract is up at the end of the season but i would like to stay here and play for as long as i can but thats out of my hands at the moment all i can do is try and do well on the pitch when i play
6490694 obviously im very honoured to be a part of the leadership group ive always got on pretty well with coach ricki herbert and before i signed he obviously saw something in me stuck by me and i really appreciate that hopefully since ive been here ive helped repay his faith a little bit
6490695 i wouldve liked to have been playing more than i have but i think ive done well for the club when i have played
6490696 i felt like i was contributing when i did play i was probably upset you could say that that i didnt play as much as i would have liked but hopefully this season if i get a start maybe i can stay in the team
6490697 i wouldve liked to have started the game as opposed to getting five minutes on the bench and then jumping straight away into a 60 40 tackle and nearly breaking my shoulder
6490698 i suppose i couldve got to that a while ago if it wasnt for injury but its a good achievement hopefully theres a few more to come yet
6490699 it was important to make sure my future beyond next year was sorted out as soon as possible especially now that i have a young family
6490700 when the cowboys showed an interest it made sense that i signed with them considering im from queensland and its a little bit closer to home
6490701 while theyve struggled a bit this year the cowboys have some great players and with a bit of luck i can enjoy as much success there as i have in melbourne
6490702 i think most of the teams see our breakdown at the moment as a weakness
6490703 the last time we played australia in perth they made it really tough for us at the breakdown but weve put a lot of work into the breakdown this week and i think itll pay off
6490704 i think we just need to be more effective at the breakdown and more precise
6490705 at times weve had numbers there and not taken the guys away its definitely an area we need to improve because australia have got fantastic fetchers as well
6490706 this is an opportunity to discuss issues with the irb face to face
6490707 wed like to discuss our request to meet referees in the company of opposition coaches before test matches
6490708 we have enormous sympathy for referees who in some cases have had to manage blowing as many as five different sets of laws this season its only natural that wed want to talk to them about interpretations in such a complex environment
6490709 eu zic ca totul e posibil si chiar e nu e de bine neaparat caci totul inseamna si raul suprem dar atata timp cat totul inseamna si binele suprem consider ca avem sanse egale de a da in viata de ceea ce vrem
6490710 in nici 10 secunde mi am amintit amuzat de alta ironie a vietii
6490711 the government more than recovered in tax its input and the economic returns were more than we expected
6490712 what this shows is government funding can be a catalyst the government can get all of its money back through tax returns and we can have a boosted economy as well
6490713 hes still having a few problems with his wrist so its probably not up to playing a game of football as yet
6490714 mate he leads by example jonny hes got a lot of respect from the guys around him and thats what you want from your captain
6490715 hes a very good footballer you know even though hes getting on a wee bit he still puts his hand up every week he trains hard every week hes as close as what weve got to a professional
6490716 hes been an outstanding footballer for a long long time
6490717 itll be great to see him playing at a higher level
6490718 im pretty hopeful were going to have a good year with this team
6490719 did you hear of that olympic athlete who had cfs and just decided it wasnt going to stop her and she won gold

6490760 i understand senator mccain was asked yesterday this question how many houses do you own and he couldnt answer that question
6490761 he couldnt count high enough to know how many houses he owns
6490762 his own surreal fantasies and sexual experiences viewed through the lens of his visual obsessions
6490763 how to have a xxx sex life the ultimate vivid guide
6490764 since he took power musharraf never gained the credibility and respect of his people as a strong leader who can run the country
6490765 musharraf saw himself as the savior who will prevent the country from deteriorating on several fronts particularly concerning to him was the escalation internally there was no guarantee that things wont get into chaos leading to the fall of pakistans nuclear weapons into the hands of the radicals and extremists
6490766 rejected its savior when he joined forces with the us and joined the war on terror this led him to fight his own people it made him look as if he participated in a war on islam
6490767 in pakistan the people of jihad are infiltrated into key positions in the intelligence community and the army for example it provides the mujahideen a great advantage
6490768 its over for you musharraf will the us stand with you now as you stood with them against muslims in pakistan and afghanistan

6490779 she has asked film execs to find the perfect pad
6490780 keith and i are just appealing to the press to give us a little space so we can walk around sydney and show the baby our town just a little bit because shes tiny shes not a doll shes a real little thing just not right in our face or her face because its scary for her shes tiny a tiny little thing
6490781 it is difficult to close a magazine particularly when it means that some of our colleagues positions will be affected i want to thank the very talented editorial and sales teams for years of hard work and dedication to this brand the current economic environment is difficult and the mid market home sector has been particularly hard hit when the middle market recovers we will consider future publication of home using the special interest publication newsstand model

6490784 quite conservative in its projections of obesity prevalence and estimates of attributable fractions for conditions associated with obesity diabetes cardiovascular disease various types of cancer and osteoarthritis
6490785 these new figures are tragic and frightening and represent a wake up call for the nation
6490786 they show that previous estimates of the epidemics size and cost were very much understated
6490787 we know that obesity and type two diabetes can be prevented and we need to make fundamental changes in the way we live to arrest the escalating crisis
6490788 for hundreds of thousands of australians this is the best news of their life and for many of those people had they been diagnosed with exactly the same cancer 20 years ago the outcome would have looked very different it continues to build australia as a leader internationally in cancer outcomes
6490789 it ought not to be an option for a young school leaver to get welfare benefits
6490790 young people should be presented with two options you either earn or learn welfare payments should not be an option for people under 21
6490791 weve got experiences skills technologies and strategies to share with californians who are battling the same water challenges as queenslanders
6490792 our dna analysis corroborates what the historical sources say namely that vanilla was a trade item brought to tahiti by french sailors in the mid 19th century the french admiral responsible for introducing vanilla to tahiti alphonse hamelin used vanilla cuttings from the philippines the historical record tells us that vanilla which isnt native to the philippines was previously introduced to the region via the manila galleon trade from the new world and specifically from guatemala
6490793 the pre columbian maya had been managing their forests for millennia to cultivate cacao and to make chocolate and we know they were also cultivating vanilla to use it as a chocolate spice the maya created these forest gardens by introducing different types of species of wild cacao and vanilla from the surrounding forests which meant that species that had previously been geographically separated were then able to hybridize because they were in the same place thats the scenario we present in our research paper for how tahitian vanilla got started it is an evolutionary product but also a maya artifact
6490794 pesach has demonstrated that vanilla species can exchange genes quite frequently across species barriers
6490795 this provides an opportunity to breed new commercial varieties of vanilla through hybridization in the future
6490796 todo gran proyecto necesita transformarse para trascender y hoy nosotros estamos iniciando ese proceso
6490797 no she isnt shes been inside in the air conditioning all day
6490798 we are deeply saddened and shocked by the sudden and unexpected death of our leader gene upshaw
6490799 gene learned he was sick just this past sunday and he died with his family at his side
6490800 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6490801 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field
6490802 it is a sad day for the nfl but genes positive impact and legacy will live on for decades to come
6490803 we had a few occasional 3g signal dropping troubles at some locations especially on high rises building streets amp on our 34th floor edge picked up immediately but slower internet speeds
6490804 to halt international military cooperation events between russia and nato countries until further instructions
6490805 for all practical purposes military to military cooperation had really already been ended with the russians
6490806 i cant imagine a circumstance right now that we would engage in military cooperation with the russians until the situation in georgia is resolved
6490807 we still have some very important issues that we need to work with russia on
6490808 leading alliance members came to us and whispered in our ears hoping that we do not halt cooperation with nato on afghanistan
6490809 at the moment i am speaking to you i have never been so aware of what the solitude of a head of state could be in the face of the decisions he has to take
6490810 drawing the consequences in terms of equipment on the military escorting of our operations and of the missions that are conducted in afghanistan
6490811 que el concepto no ser un grupo hecho para el deleite de los hombres como hay otros

6490813 im here to tell you if either mccain or huckabee get the nomination its going to destroy the republican party its going to change it forever be the end of it a lot of people arent going to vote you watch
6490814 this is how hes going to get even with republicans for defeating him in south carolina in 2000
6490815 its pro choicers who are voting for mccain thats who liberals are
6490816 which hasnt been officially announced it will be released in 2010
6490817 i want to stress that this storm is becoming a serious catastrophic flooding event
6490818 in the past weve usually had flooding in pockets i have not seen anything this widespread throughout the county
6490819 not something that lends itself to on the job training
6490820 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean
6490821 one of the aims of irans 10 year space program is to send a manned rocket into space
6490822 within in the next six months to one year the exact date of this mission will be determined
6490823 they supposedly fixed the problem which the pilot later said was with the air conditioning and then we took off
6490824 the plane was wobbling from one side to another then i began to suspect we would crash i dont know what happened next i was in a sort of river and saw people smoke explosions which i think woke me up
6490825 i took a child into the truck and he thought he was in a film but he asked when will this film end and where is my dad he asked if it was real if he was in a film but he wanted the film to end
6490826 those responsible say that it will take two days at the most to finish identifying people by their fingerprints dna identification will take a bit more
6490827 we have to closely monitor the records but we see no reason to take such measures
6490828 its been years since engine failure on take off or a fire has prevented a flight from continuing
6490829 making a t shirt with the dead person and either jesus an angel wings gods hands harps clouds
6490830 as a coach i look at this roster we have landon donovan and david beckham as a starting point thats fabulous
6490831 i think we have a good group of players to join in and make this a good team
6490832 ive been impressed with the things hes done in this league given all the issues and the demands on his time
6490833 i think hes had a pretty healthy attitude toward the league
6490834 who wouldnt look forward to working with a great player thats one of the great parts of this job
6490835 i have a great opportunity in a great environment and i think we can make things much better than they are right now
6490836 we intend to win championships we know its going to take time and take some patience and hopefully a team that will qualify for international competitions and do well there also
6490837 i told them that the team is not about landon donovan and david beckham its about all of us
6490838 its we its us its not i and its not me
6490839 if we work together as a group we can achieve things
6490840 he has an understanding of our strengths as a team and more importantly our weaknesses
6490841 we stepped out on the training field today and unlike any training session weve had all year we immediately addressed those and we worked on them
6490842 our mentality cant be that we can outscore the other team 5 4 we need all 11 of us to think defense we have to give away nothing so that we can give our special players who are special opportunities to get their chances and win the game for us
6490843 after eight or nine months away from the game i was looking forward to getting back into it
6490844 the sun and the weather year round i dont really like i prefer the east coast where its 100 degrees and humid right now and in the winter i love the snow and the blizzards and all im crazy to be here
6490845 my wife reminded me that it is 24 years this week when i first started working with bruce back at uva university of virginia
6490846 from my perspective obama needs to introduce a game changer and fast before public opinion starts to gel around the notion that he is a phenom who deserves great respect but is not seasoned enough and would we too much of a risk in the oval office

6490853 the rubbish trucks can easily get down our road it just takes them a touch longer
6490854 if were not getting this service we should pay less council tax
6490855 driver visibility is reduced and pedestrians are forced into the street its an accident waiting to happen
6490856 were in the process of reviewing our collection procedures to make them more efficient we need to make savings
6490857 i have morals i dont want to call or contact anyone during the holidays
6490858 i dont like to be sold anything during the holidays so i dont want to sell
6490859 the holidays are not for business it is a time for family
6490860 i am so focused during the other 11 months i need to check out in december to recharge my batteries
6490861 nobody buys in december unless it is for holiday gifts
6490862 none of my clients want to talk business during the holidays
6490863 most people organize and put more effort into planning their yearly one week vacation than they spend on planning their lives
6490864 do today what others wont so you can do tomorrow what others cant
6490865 quammen brilliantly and powerfully re creates the 19th century naturalists intellectual and spiritual journey
6490866 darwin vs himself caution and honesty in the life of a reluctant revolutionary
6490867 a high oil price makes moving everything more expensive basically
6490868 transportation costs soar and because movement is vital to the modern economy every time this has occurred global economic growth has slowed
6490869 the 1973 74 oil shock devastated the global economy the 1979 80 shock slowed global growth by more than 40
6490870 and during both shocks the united states economy and much of the developed world fell into a recession
6490871 the current global gdp slowdown confirms the classic economic theory
6490872 a sudden high oil price is never a good thing it may speed fuel efficiency but the economic damage it causes far outweighs anything else

6490882 for walker not to make those plays thats discouraging because he was paid an awful lot of money paid like one of the top five receivers in the nfl

6490884 an injury to this area often leads to death because the bleeding is so profuse
6490885 my electrical meter should be standing still or going backwards
6490886 the system will offset their electrical bill by about 80 percent
6490887 it will stabilize their bill and shield them from the unknown of future edison rate increases
6490888 it will offset 537 000 miles driven by the average car
6490889 thats about eliminating 21 500 miles driven per year its like taking 1 7 cars off the road for 25 years and planting 2 8 acres of trees
6490890 esta bastante claro para mi que al publicar superboy la editorial act a ilegalmente
6490891 we suffer from a fiscal cancer it is growing inside us
6490892 our country would need 53 trillion invested today which is about 175 000 per person to deliver on the governments obligations and promises how much of this 53 trillion do we have zip
6490893 every single one of those quotations came from the campaign of 1960 when the republicans attacked john fitzgerald kennedy

6490897 when its hard living on a 500 per month fixed income hard to pay the light bill pay for natural gas go to town and buy gasoline thats when it hits home
6490898 we know that here in south carolina we have a disparity in health care
6490899 we have to bring in communities that will be more affected make them part of the decision making
6490900 why do you need us to join the climate debate are you saying because i am black i am not involved already or that you need more useful victims for your cause agenda
6490901 it becomes evident that while discussing climate we are not witnessing a clash of views about the environment but a clash of views about human freedom
6490902 as someone who lived under communism for most of my life i feel obliged to say that the biggest threat to freedom democracy the market economy and prosperity at the beginning of the 21st century is not communism or its various softer variants
6490903 why do so many people who subscribe to the belief in global warming also subscribe to the leftist liberal viewpoint on so many matters why does this belief appeal to those that have a certain political view
6490904 what does a cane toad and salt water intrusion have to do with global warming see you liberals just flip and spin flip and spin obama is an expert at it
6490905 it didnt take us long to figure out what this
6490906 if the lawyers will take the case sue the people who sell carbon credits that includes al gore that lawsuit would get so much publicity so much media attention and as the experts went to the witness stand and testified i feel like that could become the vehicle to finally put some light on the fraud of global warming
6490907 also i dont think that the republicans have handled the war on terror very well either
6490908 none of the studies cited above has shown clear evidence that we can attribute the observed climate changes to increases in greenhouse gases
6490909 no study to date has positively attributed all or part of the climate change to man made causes
6490910 how can you be so self centered how can you seriously type this nonsense
6490911 quit categorizing everyone who is not a conservative republican as an athiest who has no love and respect for this nation
6490912 how can you be so self centered how can you seriously type this nonsense
6490913 btw going from the frying pan to the fire is technically
6490914 bowing to pressure from environmental groups the florida senate recently passed a bill backed by gov charlie crist that would eventually shut down six pipes that carry waste water into the atlantic from miami dade broward and palm beach counties
6490915 people are getting smart on the bs behind mmgw and that is exactly why algore is trying to recruit
6490916 he absolutely adores those kids hes doing it really well
6490917 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
6490918 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6490919 if we use their tactics well lose the moral high ground
6490920 a general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor
6490921 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6490922 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6490923 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6490924 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6490925 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6490926 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6490927 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6490928 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6490929 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6490930 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6490931 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6490932 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6490933 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6490934 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6490935 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6490936 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6490937 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6490938 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6490939 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6490940 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
6490941 im in the u k all the time but of course i cant bring all my friends so ive decided to look for a new bff across the pond i need a best friend who is hot who can keep up with me and most of all who is real and wont be a backstabber im not leaving london until i find that amazing girl or guy who can meet the challenges of being my british bestie
6490942 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6490943 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6490944 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6490945 dna evidence and photo evidence of the creature will be presented

6490947 in order to ensure smooth traffic flow a nice environment and good social order we will invite these participants to hold their demonstrations in designated places
6490948 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis

6490950 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
6490951 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
6490952 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
6490953 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6490954 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6490955 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice

6490957 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years

6490959 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
6490960 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
6490961 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
6490962 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
6490963 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
6490964 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
6490965 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
6490966 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
6490967 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
6490968 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6490969 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
6490970 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
6490971 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
6490972 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
6490973 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
6490974 oh weve got more important things we have to do
6490975 for a lot of people who have health insurance they are paying more for health care but it may not show up as concretely as paying 70 to fill their gas tank
6490976 college costs health care costs and energy costs are up and income is down
6490977 any one of those subjects touches a raw nerve for the middle class in this country im seeing it in race after race
6490978 the issue of health care may be getting less attention than it deserves from the media but its still a top concern for voters and among the top issues that sen obama talks about on the campaign trail
6490979 there is a stark contrast in the way both candidates would address the issue because the views on providing affordability accessibility and portability of health care are so divergent it could hardly escape the conversation each candidate will have with voters
6490980 if people had to pass that many signs that announced how much health care costs you can bet it would be at the top of the agenda
6490981 it is strikingly different from 2000 when gore spent 60 percent of the time at most events talking about health care
6490982 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him
6490983 the most inexperienced ticket in the history of the world
6490984 the movie revolves around a singular day when jimmy page the edge and jack white first met and sat down together to share their stories teach and play

6490989 auster moves from the personal to the political august brill a retired book critic and widower lies in bed recovering from a car accident and conjures an alternate reality in which al gore won the 2000 election and sept 11 and the iraq war never happened instead theres a civil war its an intriguing idea and the brooklyn resident who is also a screenwriter translator and occasional song lyricist will read from the work at politics amp prose on thursday express man in the dark
6490990 that blowhard needs to close his yap or lose his job
6490991 were doing jokes about people in his orbit not really about him
6490992 people have a tendency to react as far as their ideology allows them
6490993 i think some of us were maybe too quick to caricature al gore and john kerry and theres maybe some reluctance to do the same thing to him
6490994 anything that has even a whiff of being racist no one is going to laugh
6490995 the audience is not going to allow anyone to do that
6490996 most readers will see it as tasteless and offensive and we agree
6490997 totally inappropriate and frankly i understand if sen obama and his supporters would find it offensive
6490998 we put people in a crazy box they might be truly offended by it but the reaction is part of the standard digestive process bill maher who is host of a politically oriented late night show on hbo said if you cant do irony on the cover of the new yorker where can you do it one issue that clearly has some impact on writing jokes about obama is a consistency among the big late night shows not only are all the hosts white the vast majority of their audiences are white i think white audiences get a little self conscious if race comes up sweeney of obriens show said things might be somewhat different if even one late night host was black black comics are not having any trouble joking about obama said david alan grier a comedian who starting in october will have a satirical news magazine show on comedy central chocolate news i tell jokes on stage about him grier said reciting a few that would not ever get onto a network late night show nor into the new york times but he said of the late night hosts those guys really cant go there its just like the gay comic can do gay material it comes with the territory
6490999 no way theyve had 200 years of presidential jokes its our time jimmy kimmel the host of the abc late night talk show jimmy kimmel live
6491000 theres a weird reverse racism going on you cant joke about him because hes half white its silly i think its more a problem because hes so polished he doesnt seem to have any flaws maher said that being sensitive to obama was in no way interfering with his commentary though on hbo he has more freedom about content than other comedians theres been this question about whether hes black enough
6491001 i have this joke what does he have to do dunk he bowled a 37 to me thats black enough kimmel said i think his ears should be the focus of the jokes mostly the late night shows seem to be in a similar position were just waiting
6491002 there hasnt been a lot of frame of reference about obama yet not like hillary or mccain but there will be

6491008 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6491009 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6491010 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
6491011 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
6491012 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
6491013 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
6491014 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
6491015 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
6491016 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
6491017 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6491018 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6491019 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6491020 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6491021 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6491022 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6491023 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6491024 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
6491025 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
6491026 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
6491027 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
6491028 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6491029 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
6491030 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
6491031 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
6491032 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
6491033 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
6491034 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
6491035 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
6491036 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
6491037 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
6491038 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6491039 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6491040 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
6491041 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
6491042 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet

6491045 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment

6491049 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
6491050 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6491051 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6491052 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
6491053 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6491054 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6491055 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list

6491065 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6491066 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6491067 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants

6491069 jerusalem must remain the capital of israel and must remain undivided
6491070 first we divide the amount of energy that the reactor produces 2 500 megawatts by the nameplate rating of the wind turbine which is 1
6491071 now let us look at the amount of land area that would be needed for these 6 668 wind turbines
6491072 to figure the spacing of the wind turbines let us multiply the rotor diameter of 77 meters by 3 which gives us 231 meters as the spacing between the wind turbines
6491073 if we multiply 231 by 385 it will give us the total area required to site one of our 1 5 mw wind turbines this comes out to 88 935 square meters or 22 acres of land for one 1 5 mw wind turbine if we now multiply the 22 acres by the 6 668 wind turbines we get 146 696 acres which is 229 21 square miles about three times the size of the metropolitan washington d c area so it appears that it will take 146 696 acres of land covered with wind turbines to have a part time generating capability equivalent to that achieved on 4 000 acres of land for the nuclear power plant which includes a lake used to provide water to the cooling towers
6491074 wind energy advocates purposely confuse the availability factor and the capacity factor in their promotional materials to try to demonstrate that a certain number of wind turbines can produce the same energy as a nuclear power plant in truth although the availability factor of the wind turbine is 100 because it is available to produce power at any time wind turbines actually produce power less than 25 of the time and that is only when the wind blows compare this to the nuclear power plant in which the availability factor and the capacity factor are the same about 95 the only time the nuclear reactor is not producing power is during maintenance periods

6491090 every page contains important gems of truth and understanding that illustrate the wonderful fact that jesus came to set the captives free i will be strongly recommending this book
6491091 i loved rebeccas book because it is refreshing simply written and informative and it captured my attention she handles this subject with insight wisdom and compassion i highly recommend it
6491092 the lord is leading us into a season to go deeper deeper in understanding deeper in confirmation authority to tread is a practical guide to warfare that reveals the full scope of understanding the enemy in the atmosphere around you in the land you walk on and in the societal structures that affect the way we live rebecca fully reveals how to get your feet planted firmly over the enemys plan in your region
6491093 i have served alongside becca in the trenches on a prayer journey to nepal just short of the foot of mount everest in 1997 she is a serious student and practitioner of all three levels of spiritual warfare and i am delighted that she has now become an excellent teacher of this highly specialized subject drawing on her solid extensive experience what a delight for me personally to see the baton of strategic level spiritual warfare passed into such capable hands of the next generation

6491102 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
6491103 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6491104 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6491105 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6491106 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6491107 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6491108 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6491109 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
6491110 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
6491111 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
6491112 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
6491113 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
6491114 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict

6491125 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect

6491131 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
6491132 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
6491133 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
6491134 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
6491135 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote

6491144 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6491145 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6491146 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6491147 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6491148 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6491149 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6491150 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6491151 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6491152 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc

6491217 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
6491218 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
6491219 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values

6491228 this is an area not well handled in the past
6491229 we do know it is a very big issue especially for athletes retiring who can suffer long term considerable downs
6491230 it is difficult i can see how athletes suffer from depression you spend the last 12 to 13 years of your life preparing for an olympic gold medal and when it stops it is a hollow feeling

6491311 is capitol hill back to square one of legislature judiciary power drill
6491312 in my considered view and opinion it will be not only unlawful and illegal to elect an acting pro tempore but that such an act will also bring into disrepute and ridicule the credibility and image of the honorable liberian senate of the 52nd legislature of the republic of liberia
6491313 the liberian senate took a vote which resulted into the suspension of the pro tempore in my view a suspension is an enforced temporary incapacitation and there is no precedence in our common law jurisdiction where an election is held to fill a temporary vacancy created by a temporary incapacitation
6491314 by doing anything without regards for the foregoing we will not only bring this institution to disrepute but we will also trivialize our votes functions and works
6491315 and indeed we have done any and everything outside of the law because the majority said so
6491316 if we do proceed to elect an acting pro tempore for a short period of five months the signal or impression we will sent is that we have no intention of doing things right in the liberian senate and our expression of grievances were not done in good faith but just to further justify the continue down sliding of the liberian senate
6491317 my experience over the years has taught me that when you are role model or someone the community has due regards and respect for that creates the duty and obligations on you to conduct yourself in your office or in private in such a way that you will give direction counsel and hope to people by this i mean you will contribute to the respect of rule of law procedures processes and the restoration of values and norms which will engender a stable and ordered society

6491385 well last week when we were discussing the creation of the world you said that life on earth could not have come about by evolution we both agree on the one really essential aspect that god created all living things but when you say that he could not do so by an evolutionary process are you not in effect saying that god could not do with the beasts and the lilies of the field what man can do with cows and dogs or wheat and roses
6491386 still i see no great problem there are so many explanations for example evolution might account only for mans physical body the addition of that divine spark that sets man apart from the other animals might have been the final step that created the man adam whichever way it came about i am willing to wait until some future time for the details
6491387 i never try to convert anyone to evolution but i do believe in helping people to understand enough to judge for themselves what i was trying to do was to convince you that one can believe in evolution and still believe in the gospel i believe the gospel embraces all truth then if evolution is true it is part of the gospel
6491388 by contrast life may have begun as one or a number of simple one celled organisms these organisms developed the ability to duplicate themselves by some process so the products were similar to but not necessarily identical with the parent cells thus there would be slight variations among the offspring it seems quite logical that those individuals which were best adapted to their environment would be the ones most likely to survive and if they lived long enough to reproduce they would be the ones which would leave offspring
6491389 you see charles darwin was strongly impressed by the fact that men have been able to make great improvements in domestic plants and animals by selective breeding this was one of the things that led to his theory of evolution darwin reasoned that those which were best adapted to their particular environment would live and reproduce thereby leaving progeny similar to themselves here then was a mechanism for the selection of the favored races that would survive darwin termed it natural selection in contrast to the artificial selection practiced by man in improving domestic plants and animals
6491390 from the fossil record we learn that the dinosaurs were the dominant animals on earth between 225 and 67 million years ago
6491391 the scriptures tell why man was created but they do not tell how though the lord has promised that he will tell that when he comes again d amp c 101 32 33 in 1931 when there was intense discussion on the issue of organic evolution the first presidency of the church then consisting of presidents heber j grant anthony w ivins and charles w nibley addressed all of the general authorities of the church on the matter and concluded upon the fundamental doctrines of the church we are all agreed our mission is to bear the message of the restored gospel to the world leave geology biology archaeology and anthropology no one of which has to do with the salvation of the souls of mankind to scientific research while we magnify our calling in the realm of the church upon one thing we should all be able to agree namely that presidents joseph f smith john r winder and anthon h lund were right when they said adam is the primal parent of our race first presidency minutes apr 7 1931
6491392 one of brigham young academys most enthusiastic advocates of evolutionary theory was english professor nels nelson
6491393 subjects ranging from communism to eugenics were hotly debated both in and out of class at bya
6491394 without mentioning names he accused four or five of the byu teachers of championing organic evolution and higher biblical criticism
6491395 elder james e talmage heading a program of lectures at byu by leading church authorities added a modicum of balance by suggesting that there may have been a special creation of man independent of other animal life which may have evolved
6491396 byus y news termed charles darwin a man possibly as great in his chosen field as george washington and abraham lincoln were in theirs adding throughout his long life the only thing he feared and shunned were hate and prejudice
6491397 twenty fours years later during the dedication of the eyring science center harvey fletcher then on the faculty of columbia university observed to the audience i think in most scientific societies this would be considered a most unusual thing to dedicate to the lord a building of science
6491398 elder john widtsoe began a gospel question and answer series in the improvement era including his analysis of some of the arguments against evolutionary theory
6491399 president david o mckay subsequently asked apostle adam s bennion former superintendent of church schools to solicit responses to elder joseph fielding smiths book from qualified lds scientists
6491400 thus it was with relief that pro science academicians listened to elder hugh b
6491401 almost a full year later the first presidency met with apostles petersen and romney who had been asked to carefully review mormon doctrine both reported that the book had not been cleared for publication by the churchs reading committee elder petersen remarked that he had located more than 1 000 doctrinal errors while elder romney reported that he had identified nearly forty problem areas including the treatment of evolution evolutionists pre adamites status of animals and plants in the garden of eden and the meaning of the various accounts of creation the first presidency concluded that the book was full of errors and misstatements and that it was most unfortunate that it had received such wide circulation a second revised edition of mormon doctrine appeared several years later although almost no changes were made to mitigate the books views on evolution
6491402 in october 1964 the churchs improvement era printed an article on the age of the earth which concluded that the earth was 13 000 years old roughly the age chronicled for it in the bible in response to a number of criticisms bertrand f harrison chair of byus botany department was asked the following year to write an article for the churchs sunday school teachers magazine the instructor on organic evolution david lawrence mckay a son of president david mckay and a member of the general church sunday school superintendency read harrisons article to his father who approved it for publication harrisons essay the relatedness of living things was printed in the july 1965 instructor and was the most pro evolution article ever to have appeared in an official church periodical
6491403 when dallin oaks replaced ernest wilkinson as byu president in august 1971 he soon learned of serious problems on campus regarding the role of evolution at the university in his first address to the faculty in september he asked that guilty parties particularly among members of the religion faculty stop casting aspersions on the testimony and devotion of their colleagues in the sciences
6491404 in mid september 1977 the college of physical and mathematical sciences with the cooperation of religious instruction began offering a series of one hour science and religion seminars after the first two sessions william o
6491405 speaking to church educators at byu in mid august 1979 marion g
6491406 mcconkie delivered the harshest denunciation of organic evolution to date
6491407 former dean lester allen was asked to submit to the church an informed albeit unofficial response to criticisms that the church was anti science allen wrote the theory of organic evolution is a product of good science it is a powerful well substantiated tool for explaining many facts and observations in nature numerous lds scholars find the theory of evolution both scientifically sound and not in conflict with gods revelations to the lds scientist he concluded evolution is an expression of gods omnipotent control of nature not beyond law but fully in accord with it during the churchs next general conference in october 1984 however both elders packer and mcconkie delivered separate anti evolution addresses

6491525 the design of the universe is very magnificent and shouldnt be taken for granted in fact i believe that is why einstein had so little use for organized religion although he strikes me as a basically very religious man he must have looked at what the preacher said about god and felt that they were blaspheming he had seen much more majesty than they had every imagined and they were just not talking about the real thing my guess is that he simply felt that religions hed run across did not have proper respect for the author of the universe
6491526 we commonly represent god as a busy eager somewhat frustrated father hurrying about seeking help to carry out his benevolent plan to bring peace and salvation to the world too many missionary appeals are based upon this fancied frustration of almighty god
6491527 if there is a personal god as the christians say who spoke this universe into being then there is a certain respect and reverence and wonder and dread that would have to come through when we talk about him and when we worship him
6491528 to whom then will you compare me that i should be like him
6491529 when i left england my hope of indias conversion was very strong but amongst so many obstacles it would die unless upheld by god well i have god and his word is true though the superstitions of the heathen were a thousand times stronger than they are and the example of the europeans a thousand times worse though i were deserted by all and persecuted by all yet my faith fixed on the sure word would rise above all obstructions and overcome every trial gods cause will triumph
6491530 the chief end of man is to glorify god and enjoy him for ever
6491531 the chief end of god is to glorify god and enjoy himself for ever
6491532 for my names sake i defer my anger for the sake of my praise i restrain it for you that i may not cut you off behold i have refined you but not like silver i have tried you in the furnace of affliction for my own sake for my own sake i do it for how should my name be profaned my glory i will not give to another
6491533 for the sake of his name among all the nations
6491534 they knew that god had superexalted jesus enthroning him at his right hand and bestowing upon him the highest rank in order that every tongue should confess his lordship they longed that jesus should receive the honor due his name
6491535 as we seek to find out why with such millions of christians the real army of god that is fighting the hosts of darkness is so small the only answer is lack of heart the enthusiasm of the kingdom is missing and that is because there is so little enthusiasm for the king

6491555 without the loan it would have been very difficult for the colony to redevelop this site from old underutilized industrial uses to a major retailer
6491556 this successful project is the first brownfields loan made to a tribal nation in epas pacific southwest region and were proud to have funded ndeps program

6491571 few people in the history of the national football league have played the game as well as gene and then had another career in football with so much positive impact on the structure and competitiveness of the entire league as gene
6491572 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6491573 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6491574 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6491575 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children i didnt know gene personally i just knew him professionally
6491576 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so
6491577 he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
6491578 im not going to sell the players on a cap again
6491579 once we go through the cap why should we agree to it again
6491580 gene and i developed a close friendship that remained strong through the good times and some of the nfls most difficult challenges
6491581 we worked very closely on key issues that allowed the nfl to maintain unprecedented labor peace his biggest asset was his understanding of the business of the game and you always knew that his concern for the games best interests guided his actions

6491655 russia has informed us through military channels that the minister of defence of the russian federation has taken a decision to halt international military cooperation events between russia and nato countries until further instructions
6491656 the united states has consistently counseled georgia over a long period of time that there is no military solution in south ossetia
6491657 including the day before georgian troops went into south ossetia we said dont do it dont be drawn into a military conflict its not in your interest
6491658 but the pressure on georgia was too great and they felt they had to act and that gave russia the excuse they were looking for to launch a massive military operation with over 20 000 troops
6491659 its easy to see the careful preparation and the deliberate pressure put on georgia to which they responded unwisely
6491660 we need some kind of internationalization of peacekeeping to have credibility when it comes to maintaining georgias territory integrity and sovereignty
6491661 we welcome any step in which the israeli occupation leaves us alone living in dignity without checkpoints and racism

6491667 its been years since engine failure on take off or a fire has prevented a flight from continuing
6491668 when the u s lost three and a half thousand people on september 11th russia became the first country to express its support
6491669 for south ossetia to lose 1 500 or 2 000 people today is a terrible tragedy but no one knows about it
6491670 to shoot at kids at children from a tank its a shame and the world should know about this shame
6491671 the world doesnt know the truth about what happened in tskhinvali there is a huge manipulation of public opinion happening now
6491672 i am a musician and i am also an ossetian and what makes me tense is i have friends in georgia but the georgians do not know the truth
6491673 i have already prepared an address to the president of the russian federation and to the heads of state of the international community with a request to recognize our independence

6491695 hardball politics and partisan redistricting are nothing new republicans have certainly done their fair share there is also no novelty in pushing redistricting proposals through ballot initiative or in hard fought judicial campaigns what is remarkable here is the brazen effort to sidestep the traditional political process and seize control of the state judiciary so as to advance a blatantly partisan agenda

6491706 community involvement and philanthropy are very important to our lives
6491707 we are passionate about supporting projects that will help bring an end to the national nursing shortage
6491708 this gift will have a lasting impact on generations of nursing students at michigan state university and has transformed the possibility of the nursing addition into a reality
6491709 notably this gift is the single largest philanthropic commitment in the colleges history
6491710 bernadette marquez endorsement of this project embodies her personal value of the education she received and the couples belief that a nursing education from michigan state university should be accessible to future generations of students at all levels
6491711 in response to the national nursing and nursing faculty shortage and in anticipation of support for a nursing addition the university strategically increased enrollments more than 110 percent from 2003 to 2007
6491712 we now need to focus on expanding the physical capacity to accommodate our enrollment growth
6491713 i am honored to be a part of marking a new era of excellence in nursing education at michigan state university
6491714 i hope others will join my husband and me in this challenge to be a part of history

6491717 fibrosis is a disease of many organs lungs kidneys pancreas prostate skin
6491718 its possible this mechanism in the liver is relevant to fibrotic situations in other tissues
6491719 once a lot of extracellular matrix has formed its very hard to clear
6491720 the material just sits there and creates an inflammatory environment
6491721 we suggest that following tissue damage hepatic stellate cells become activated and proliferate intensely senesce and are eventually cleared to protect the liver from an excessive fibrogenic response to acute injury
6491722 however in response to chronic tissue damage for example as produced by viral hepatitis or fatty liver disease continual rounds of hepatocyte i
6491723 we found that eventually they senesced and were cleared from the liver to protect it from an excessive fibrogenic response to acute injury
6491724 cell cycle arrest in the cells that generate the fibrosis places a kind of brake on the process limiting how far it can go
6491725 we hypothesize that hscs when they senesce secret less fibrogenic protein and also stimulate a process that tends to degrade proteins that are still present in a lesion
6491726 senescence is a kind of homeostatic mechanism that enables the tissue to return to its pre damaged state
6491727 this may prove to be broadly relevant to other wound healing processes
6491728 the approach is a new application of the well known botanical phenomenon of aerial root development

6491817 russian and georgian media reported several days ago that israel decided to stop its support for georgia after moscow made it clear to jerusalem and washington that russia would respond to continued aid for georgia by selling advanced anti aircraft systems to syria and iran

6491836 its been my privilege over the years to work with some exceptionally talented art directors and i think brian is in their league
6491837 to halt international military cooperation events between russia and nato countries until further instructions
6491838 for all practical purposes military to military cooperation had really already been ended with the russians
6491839 i cant imagine a circumstance right now that we would engage in military cooperation with the russians until the situation in georgia is resolved
6491840 we still have some very important issues that we need to work with russia on
6491841 leading alliance members came to us and whispered in our ears hoping that we do not halt cooperation with nato on afghanistan

6491854 please please help us we are losing our treasure our freedom i am almost crying because im seeing my country is falling
6491855 states are applying ever more fine grained methods to limit and shape the information environment to which their citizens have access
6491856 some states block access to a wide swathe of content while others tend to concentrate on one or two narrow baskets south korea for example tends to block access only to sites related to north korea
6491857 filtering can help shape the message a countrys citizens see including as may have happened recently when georgia filtered some russian web sites for the purpose of preventing enemy propaganda from reaching ones citizens
6491858 filtering isnt the primary technological way that internet freedom can be compromised
6491859 another type of cyberwarfare that occurs more regularly is hacking into computers and stealing information as well as planting trojans or viruses
6491860 they range from the electronic frontier foundations tor software to commercial anonymizers and virtual private networks and buddy system software like psiphon which allows a person in one place to handle requests for web sites from someone in a place that filters

6491866 what this does is give producers and processors one more tool in the toolbox to make these commodities safer and protect public health
6491867 there is no residue theres nothing left and certainly no radioactivity left
6491868 lingerie shouldnt be something you just put on for your lover you should do it for you its not about seducing men its about embracing womanhood
6491869 es gibt keine regel dass ber wichtige fragen nicht gemeinsam nachgedacht wird
6491870 wenn es sich nicht lediglich um eine bildungspolitische showreise handeln soll
6491871 we have got some great players wonderful players we have still got the core of more experienced heads but we have got some exciting talent coming through
6491872 we have still got robbie keane damien duff aiden mcgeady now is coming in and proving his worth so we can do well
6491873 fifa has asked the gff georgian football federation to name an alternative venue for this match by 26 august 2008 in order to be prepared should the situation in georgia still require a neutral venue
6491874 yes of course they are a good side and you have to come away from home
6491875 our record away from home over the years we have always spoken about it and we have been poor so we have got to improve on that
6491876 you will have to ask reading that im not sure i know there have been enquiries or whatever but nothing has come of it so far
6491877 it is always good to be linked with people but it doesnt mean anything unless it happens
6491878 i will just go out and try to do my very best for reading whatever happens happens but i will always be 100 per cent for reading
6491879 i dont think it is vital i made my debut when i was in the championship
6491880 but it is one of the best leagues in the world and there are a few strikers in the irish squad now who are playing in the premier league so that makes it even tougher for me to try to stay in the team
6491881 but its partly my own fault that im not playing at that level so it is up to me to get myself back there
6491882 there is a lot difference its the tiny things the minute details
6491883 people who understand the game know that managers sometimes come in there is a big blitz of goals and then it fades away
6491884 what we have done is the right way slowly we are getting better
6491885 we are going up and down a little bit but were going in the right direction
6491886 its in place now weve got the coach the captain the vice captain now we can start moving forward
6491887 we have got the cobwebs out of the way back into the england mind set
6491888 we have got to go away and there are some important games for our clubs but we are set for england now
6491889 i think maybe we underestimated them in the last campaign and we paid the price
6491890 its difficult to talk about revenge or anything like that in football but it is fresh in our minds what they have done to us their celebrations and things like that so we want to go and win the game
6491891 there was a lot of good movement a lot of good passing at times but again we still feel theres room for improvement
6491892 we are all talking every day the players are talking with each other about how we can improve we want to get things right
6491893 if we had won 5 0 people would be talking about us being world champions if we had have lost 5 0 we would be the biggest duffers ever to kick a ball
6491894 managing expectations is not something we are in control of
6491895 we have just got to do what we can control and that is our performances patience is the key it is an 18 month campaign
6491896 obviously we are making steps small strides and they might not be noticeable to the public but we are feeling them as a team and we are getting stronger
6491897 it is all about qualifying first and foremost then we want to be peaking when we get there
6491898 far too often i have felt we have peaked in the qualifiers like a couple of summers ago then in the tournaments we have not really done the business but we will be all right
6491899 nobody has the eagles or the buffalos right now we bought 2 000 ounces late last week and those were the last 2 000 ounces that we can find in the marketplace
6491900 due to the unprecedented demand our inventories have been depleted
6491901 we are therefore temporarily suspending all sales of these coins
6491902 this whole thing started about the time the ruskies made their move
6491903 it may very well be that the usgovt is preparing for the real financial meltdown by hoarding all remaining gold flows
6491904 the situation is strange and doesnt fit the normal supply amp demand economic model
6491905 the suspension is overwhelming evidence that the commodities exchanges are being used as part of a massive scheme of manipulation of the precious metals currency and bond markets
6491906 i love you wendy you have three vices books chocolate and tea
6491907 after long heavy rains there is minor seepage along the basement wall oh and a pesky vampire visits nightly

6491910 the sultan urged muslims to ignore bello abubakars brazen disregard of the sharia which clearly limits a man to four wives only
6491911 labels and artists have the right to seek as much as they can for the use of their works even if they end up setting too high a bar for some companies to clear
6491912 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6491913 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6491914 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6491915 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6491916 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6491917 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6491918 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6491919 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6491920 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6491921 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6491922 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6491923 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6491924 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6491925 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6491926 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6491927 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6491928 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6491929 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6491930 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6491931 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6491932 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6491933 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6491934 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6491935 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6491936 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6491937 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6491938 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6491939 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6491940 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6491941 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6491942 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6491943 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6491944 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6491945 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6491946 the worlds largest digging machine is almost 95 meters high and 215 meters long which is just like almost 2 5 football fields in length with 45 500 tons in weight maximum digging speed is 10 meters per minute and it can move more than 76 000 cubic meters of coal rock and earth per day
6491947 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6491948 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6491949 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6491950 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6491951 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6491952 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6491953 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6491954 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6491955 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6491956 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6491957 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6491958 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6491959 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6491960 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6491961 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6491962 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6491963 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6491964 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6491965 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6491966 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6491967 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6491968 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6491969 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6491970 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6491971 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6491972 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6491973 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6491974 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6491975 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6491976 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6491977 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6491978 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6491979 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6491980 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6491981 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6491982 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6491983 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6491984 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6491985 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6491986 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6491987 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6491988 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6491989 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6491990 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6491991 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6491992 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6491993 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6491994 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6491995 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6491996 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6491997 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6491998 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6491999 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6492000 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6492001 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6492002 this is a planning took where all things are going
6492003 web alive will help businesses deal with one of the major drawbacks of most communication technologies today the ability to give users a real life experience that is more interactive and intuitive
6492004 rather than releasing a totally new and updated standard this is a revision of 1
6492005 in the future as we move to standard 2 0 there will more than likely be pretty major changes but in this version weve come up with a lot more clarity and consolidated a number of sub requirements
6492006 how can john mccain fix the economy when he doesnt think its broken
6492007 john mccain for nuclear waste in nevada just not in his backyard
6492008 the music is literally in the air all around your head
6492009 i wish i had been nude from the time i was 12 until i was 28 i looked great i so wish i had listened to my mom and grandma when i was 18 and would complain about some little tiny bump or feeling bloated
6492010 i used to scoff and say no i feel fat today now the jokes on me
6492011 we have received the notification from the russians through military channels and they say that they have decided to halt international military co operation events between russia and nato countries until further instruction
6492012 we cannot continue with business as usual as long as russia does not commit to the principles upon which we agreed to base our relationship
6492013 we have received the notification from the russians through military channels and they say that they have decided to halt international military co operation events between russia and nato countries until further instruction
6492014 we cannot continue with business as usual as long as russia does not commit to the principles upon which we agreed to base our relationship
6492015 we have received the notification from the russians through military channels and they say that they have decided to halt international military co operation events between russia and nato countries until further instruction
6492016 we havent seen the low cost carrier model here at the airport
6492017 were now starting to see that which i think has got significant upside we see the trans tasman and newer markets in asia such as china and india as being very important
6492018 we are in discussions with parties at this stage it would be great if it could be coincidental with the rwc but at the end of the day thats not the fundamental driver
6492019 there was also good growth in retail with the new facilities
6492020 were not expecting a lot in terms of passenger volumes its a year of fairly flat profits
6492021 im taking the rest of the year off im just hanging out with my family
6492022 chris morgan has to see the neurologist he was concussed and because there is 25 minutes he has lost and cant remember we will have to wait and see how he is
6492023 ive told the players this is by far our toughest game this season after last weekends victory everyone thinks this is a formality and it is far from that
6492024 i had braces and glasses and a big curly fro
6492025 i wasnt necessarily too active in getting into the social crowd so i definitely understand not fitting in
6492026 even though she doesnt need it anymore its kept her from having to show the world her true self
6492027 its been a very different experience to be on my own
6492028 after being compared to jay leno for so long you dont think of yourself that way
6492029 she found out about the ban on tuesday when she wanted to travel to hollywood to examine a new offer
6492030 i can assure you we are well aware of the cost for people who have been unfortunately caught up in the fallout
6492031 but the likelihood of this being needed remains extremely low
6492032 this definitely is an ongoing concern its not something that were all just gonna chuck away again
6492033 looking back i dont think we had to be so blunt and alright were splitting up really we shouldve just chilled out for a bit and taken some time out to be honest
6492034 but obviously we all had a deep yearning inside to get back to do this or it wouldnt have happened i just hope we dont split up again now cause it becomes a bit silly doesnt it
6492035 its gonna be towards the end of this year or the beginning of the new one
6492036 we did six dates earlier this year and it wasnt enough i want to visit all those places weve been where we know weve got fans and breathe life into these new songs from forth thats definitely on our list of things to do
6492037 i dont think us being back together means we have to do a record every year
6492038 hef was staring at my chest because i had my bunny outfit on but he was very lovely and charming he has some scenes in the film and i thought he was pretty good at playing himself
6492039 i would like to say that i slept with hef but i didnt ill dispel that rumour right now
6492040 i did feel very sexy during the photo shoot and i was really getting into it there was a moment there when i thought maybe i should just take it all off but i dont think im ready to be a centrefold
6492041 i will just keep training hard and when i get my chance ill prove myself he sir alex said dont just do your training do your extra bits you do at united and dont be afraid to ask people at blackburn to do the extra bits because that will improve you he also said to me youd better play well because ill be watching you so hell be keeping a close eye on me but i want to prove to myself that i can challenge at this level so its a big season for me
6492042 we have a good relationship with sporting lisbon and we do not want it destroyed
6492043 but what the president has said is totally unfair we are not interested in him and we never have been but our relationship with sporting lisbon has been very good for five years now we approached them about cristiano ronaldo we sat down and we did a deal we did the same with nani
6492044 i have no words to describe it it is an unbelievable thing it is a very important step and undoubtedly the greatest of my career
6492045 it could be awkward for them both but i am sure their professionalism will ensure there are no public fireworks
6492046 i did a scene with brad in the back of a taxi and it was only a few days after he had married jennifer i chatted to him for hours giving him advice about the three stages of marriage

6492121 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6492122 we demand the iraqi government and on the highest levels not to sign this unjust agreement and we demand the withdrawal of the government as soon as possible
6492123 who says the government is giving legitimacy to hezbollah these are just ravings conjured up by the israelis to tarnish lebanons image
6492124 the moment the lebanese government confers legitimacy on hezbollah it must understand that the entire lebanese state will be a target in the same way that all of israel is a target for hezbollah

6492139 we can expect with high probability this year will be cooler than the previous five years
6492140 definitely the la nina should have had an effect how much we cannot say
6492141 up to july 2008 this year has been cooler than the previous five years at least it still looks like its warmer than average
6492142 of course at the beginning of the year there was la nina and that would have had the effect of suppressing temperatures somewhat as well
6492143 but actually la nina is showing signs of moving towards a more neutral state

6492151 it is not only about retrofitting of households but also industries and looking into the concept of smart metering by far retrofitting of households will not significantly reduce the energy consumption compared with that of businesses or large offices however in households we are concerned about the rolling out of solar powered geysers
6492152 we have to look at increasing capacity in this country through manufacturing facilities currently we can produce about 10 000 units a year

6492155 i understand that sen mccain was asked yesterday this question how many houses do you own and he couldnt answer that question he couldnt count high enough apparently to even know how many houses he owns

6492158 we need to adequately prepare for the periods when unexpected emergencies happen

6492160 these plans were developed in order to put in place a holistic strategy or plan for the energy sector in order to address not only the short term disruptions that were being faced by the country at the time energy shortages in 2005 and 2006 but also to ensure the security of supply in the medium to long term
6492161 this bill ensures that we secure the supply of both energy carriers and feedstock it contains sufficient instruments to prevent the possibility of what happened in january this year when all of a sudden we run out of coal for local electricity generation while we were busy in a business as usual way exporting coal

6492163 we didnt have the indoor facilities we couldnt throw the football because we couldnt practice year round
6492164 and then joe came in and he started to open up offenses and created a lot of problems
6492165 at first people thought aw itll never work because its not normal for the big ten with the weather and everything else but coach showed otherwise
6492166 its probably overrated the so called impact in the big ten
6492167 theres probably seven or eight teams that use it either exclusively or quite a bit so the perception that us using the spread will be different in the big ten i dont think its true
6492168 in the offseason we studied a lot of film on those guys just to try to see what they do thats different from what the other teams in our conference do
6492169 its sometimes difficult to have your bigger body defensive lineman on the field because when you get those full zone type schemes where the offensive linemen can really move and reach blocks theyll really fatigue those guys
6492170 theyve got speed youve got to be able to chase it and contain it
6492171 if they get you out there and youre going through 8 10 play drives you better either have guys in phenomenal condition or you better have some depth because theyre going to tax you
6492172 its not so much the scheme as it was the guys playing for rodriguez
6492173 id vote for pat white for the heisman right now he would have been one of the best players if not the best player in the big ten last year
6492174 this is year 44 and my last one and ive seen it go in cycles
6492175 i would suspect were in that cycle once again there probably will be a little something different
6492176 few people in the history of the national football league have played the game as well as gene and then had another career in football with so much positive impact on the structure and competitiveness of the entire league as gene
6492177 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6492178 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6492179 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6492180 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children i didnt know gene personally i just knew him professionally
6492181 im not going to sell the players on a cap again
6492182 once we go through the cap why should we agree to it again
6492183 gene and i developed a close friendship that remained strong through the good times and some of the nfls most difficult challenges
6492184 we worked very closely on key issues that allowed the nfl to maintain unprecedented labor peace his biggest asset was his understanding of the business of the game and you always knew that his concern for the games best interests guided his actions
6492185 gene was a true pioneer as one of the few african american leaders of a major union
6492186 he was the equal of owners in negotiations and made the league a better place for all players playing alongside of gene was an honor and a privilege he was a pillar of strength and leadership for our great raider teams

6492189 todd is a veteran hes got total command of what we are doing hes been very accurate making good decisions and were giving him a lot of responsibility on the line of scrimmage
6492190 he just looks the part of that returning quarterback from a good team
6492191 from what i understand about his ability his desire and his work ethic i would think hell see the field
6492192 chris had been the starting quarterback for a couple of years
6492193 being able to get along with him was very important chris did a good job of handling everything and i tried to go in and do the best i could and help the team out i contributed as much as i could
6492194 i know hes a great player and can do a lot of great things
6492195 hes very very fast and i know he really wants to learn and become a complete player i think history speaks for itself with florida and lsu the last two years if it works out for us lets use it
6492196 he told todd i cant wait to come learn from you
6492197 terrelle has kind of become his shadow he has a real passion to learn from todd boeckman
6492198 you cant turn the ball over and i know i had at least 14 last year
6492199 i think terrelle and joe are going to give us a little bit more depth than weve had at quarterback
6492200 it will be interesting because this is a different era and there was so much attention
6492201 im as interested to see what happens as everybody else

6492455 the impact of climate change on human and global security could extend far beyond the limited scope the world has seen thus far
6492456 most critical for human survival are water and food which are sensitive to changing climatic conditions
6492457 environmental changes caused by global warming will not only affect human living conditions but may also generate larger societal effects by threatening the infrastructures of society or by inducing social responses that aggravate the problem
6492458 the associated socio economic and political stress can undermine the functioning of communities the effectiveness of institutions and the stability of societal structures these degraded conditions could contribute to civil strife and worse armed conflict
6492459 large areas of africa are suffering from scarcity of food and fresh water resources making them more vulnerable to conflict an example is sudans darfur province where an ongoing conflict was aggravated since droughts forced arab herders to move into areas of african farmers
6492460 although climate change bears a significant conflict potential it can also transform the international system toward more cooperation if it is seen as a common threat that requires joint action
6492461 the bali roadmap has many good ideas but was criticized as being too vague to induce a major policy shift
6492462 nevertheless the seeming conflict between environment and the economy will be best overcome with the recognition that protecting the climate in the best interest of the economy
6492463 history has shown how dependent our culture is on a narrow window of climatic conditions for average temperature and precipitation
6492464 the great human civilizations began to flourish after the last ice age and some disappeared due to droughts and other adverse shifts in the climate
6492465 the consequences were quite severe in parts of europe associated with loss of harvest and population decline
6492466 riots and military conflicts became more likely as a recent empirical study has suggested
6492467 the challenge is to slow down the dynamics and stabilize the climate system at levels which are not dangerous
6492468 global warming receives now more public and political attention than a few years ago
6492469 grass roots movements are emerging in the united states for protecting the climate and developing energy alternatives involving not only many local communities and companies but also influential states such as california led by gov arnold schwarzenegger

6492547 true quote im not sure ill have to check with my staff so they asked his staff and he said at least four at least four
6492548 now think about that i guess if you think that being rich means you gotta make five million dollars and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6492549 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you were like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so that they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective

6492600 people in the neighbourhood are being approached to establish when the car was parked this is an important aspect of the inquiry
6492601 clearly the car has been driven from riccarton road where ms downey was last seen the car could have been used to travel around the city so any sightings of it are important
6492602 he looked like he knew what he was doing with them
6492603 they just beat up anyone who looks at them the wrong way
6492604 the police were too scared to go in there they kept going up to the door and then hed start swinging again

6492610 we will have a more detailed statement thursday once we see the statement
6492611 it is clear that the decedents own actions resulted in his death
6492612 the police used all reasonable measures to avoid the eventual outcome and to apprehend the decedent without the use of force
6492613 the police used commands mace and then their weapons as the decedent escalated the situation the decedent apparently wanted to be shot in what has frequently been referred to as suicide by cop
6492614 it is an unfortunate outcome particularly because it is apparent that the decedent suffered from significant mental health issues and a crack cocaine addiction
6492615 these conditions appear to have caused his irrational state of mind and ultimately contributed to his death
6492616 the evidence is undisputed that the decedent engaged in bizarre threatening and violent conduct that reasonably caused the officers to fear imminent danger of death or great bodily injury
6492617 furthermore the police had good reason to think that the decedent had committed a felony and was capable of inflicting further injury or death if he was not apprehended
6492618 while we mourn the fact that a human life was lost we are grateful for the courageous actions taken by the officers involved when they were faced with a decision that every police officer knows he she may have to make some day but hopes that day never comes
6492619 this matter quickly escalated and within minutes of the call being made
6492620 guardavo le nuvole vagare il sole continuava a non scaldarmi il viso so che era destinato ad essere sbagliato tu stavi cercando la grande fuga per cacciare via i tuoi demoni per troppo tempo ho provato a proteggerti dal mondo non puoi affrontare la libert da solo sono qui lasciata in silenzio tu hai abbandonato il litigio tu mi hai lasciata dietro tutto quello che hai fatto stato perdonato

6492626 the moment i got into new zealand i was really inspired by the way they spoke to me
6492627 our wing has a lot of different nationalities and i think thats good for our country
6492628 overall i think its good to talk to people about what is going on
6492629 its human nature people are scared of the other and we are the other people are scared to know us its amazing how little we know about each other
6492630 it is about people that often face prejudices in the community or find it hard to be accepted and they want to show that they are worthwhile
6492631 we need to make the residents aware of what is going on
6492632 they are telling me i have to move i dont want to move
6492633 i kind of like it here but if they are closing it down i have to go
6492634 to halt international military cooperation events between russia and nato countries until further instructions
6492635 for all practical purposes military to military cooperation had really already been ended with the russians
6492636 i cant imagine a circumstance right now that we would engage in military cooperation with the russians until the situation in georgia is resolved
6492637 we still have some very important issues that we need to work with russia on
6492638 leading alliance members came to us and whispered in our ears hoping that we do not halt cooperation with nato on afghanistan

6492640 la impostura del conseller font de mora que sha passat lestiu llan ant ocurr ncies sense sentit sobre lassignatura de leducaci per a la ciutadania i laprenentatge dangl s a les escoles de tant de buscar el titular sha anat complicant la vida fins anunciar mesures que en pocs dies sha demostrat eren un pur engany
6492641 el conseller va anunciar a bombo i plateret el passat 5 dagost que els alumnes estudiarien angl s des dels tres anys a partir del proper curs i ara es comprova que sols ser en alguns centres i a partir dels quatre la nula credibilitat de font de mora ha quedat en evid ncia
6492642 des desquerra unida vam manifestar el nostre escepticisme perqu sab em que no shan pr s les mesures i els recursos necessaris per garantir la incorporaci dun tercer idioma en leducaci infantil de tots els alumnes del pa s valenci
6492643 m s enll del seu efecte propagand stic perqu est clar que el proper curs 2008 2009 no hi haur suficient professorat per impartir angl s en tots els centres educatius dinfantil i prim ria tal com marca la loe
6492644 ja vorem quants xiquets i xiquetes tenen finalment acc s a eixa educaci triling e
6492645 sols ser real per a certs col legis d lit que ja compten amb professorat i recursos propis
6492646 molt pretenci s el conseller font de mora per parlar de triling isme quan l nic que es planteja s una hora i mitja a la setmana dangl s per als alumnes de 4 i 5 anys
6492647 calen m s fets i menys paraules i sobretot di leg amb la comunitat educativa pares i mares i docents que s n els que coneixen la realitat de lensenyament la millora de leducaci no simprovisa a colp de docv sin que es planifica es dialoga i saproven les l nies pressupost ries i tot aix s el que no ha fet font de mora
6492648 des desquerra unida compartim el desig dintroduir el tercer idioma en leducaci infantil per no sols en alguns col legis sin per a tots els centres del sistema educatiu

6492658 we have got just less than two weeks but i am hopeful we can sign some players we are still actively trying to get some people in
6492659 i have the support of the chairman who has shown his intentions and done exactly what he said he would do in supporting the team
6492660 we might get another three players in and we might be stricken with the same situation as west ham this time last year you might not be able to cope but you have a better chance if you have the people in
6492661 everybody has carried on from last year not just gabby he scored a hat trick but it was a team performance and everybody put into it
6492662 all the players get on with each other and the lads have a fantastic team bond and a great team spirit
6492663 three games in a week for me is crazy and i dont know why we do it
6492664 we know were going to play saturday saturday or saturday sunday in the league but to have a cup game in the middle of the first week is barmy for me but then again who am i
6492665 weve dealt well with the fixtures and we approached the game against aldershot in a professional manner we wanted to win that game and keep it going and then we won at barnsley to add to the three points we got against norwich despite not playing very well
6492666 but were not going to get carried away last year coventry were top of the table at the start of september i understand and we know what happened after that but we will get fitter and better and the important thing is to keep picking points up
6492667 hes one of those characters that the fans and the players take to instantly but although hes been tremendous for us he can and will get better
6492668 he was a cult hero at southend and wolves and hell be the same for coventry
6492669 having bristol city and newcastle in four days will provide us with a real test of how far we have come but it should also be a great weekend for the supporters
6492670 i am sure newcastle will put out a strong side they are unlikely to win the league but could well go far in one of the cup competitions they are probably the biggest team to have come to the ricoh in a competitive game since we moved here and it would be great to have close to a full house
6492671 she was very emotional she wasnt aware police were looking for her and that she had been reported as missing
6492672 we thank the public for all their support and information
6492673 i would stress to people if they have concerns about the wellbeing of an individual they should be reporting them as missing
6492674 i would also stress if anyone sees someone out there in a distressed state to contact the police as well because they may have a problem and we are there to help
6492675 there was not tension but we did have some disagreements
6492676 obviously smoke detectors will provide earlier warning of a fire than what a sprinkler head will do
6492677 the fire marshal came into the process late and created his own rules without statutory authority
6492678 maybe they were in the best interest of the most vulnerable but if thats what we need to do then we need to go back and change the law and not propose rules that go beyond the intent of the legislature
6492679 timothys death was the result of unconstitutional acts on the part of individuals who had access to him
6492680 in the alternative timothys death was the result of suicide
6492681 when you open the checkbook and somebody else is going to write the check theyre going to write it for a big amount
6492682 its really absurd that so many millions of dollars are being spent and the department didnt know about it
6492683 will not only establish an international quality sporting facility but is expected to generate an extra 43 million in hawkes bay with 580 extra jobs in the market
6492684 these localised environmental effects were outweighed by the social and economic benefits to the community
6492685 and that means 14 addicts alcoholics in guilford county are not going to be able to receive services
6492686 it was basically lack of oversight and attention to detail
6492687 in those two positions we have new people who have been trained differently who have much more experience
6492688 if that does not occur then that will be time to have another discussion

6492690 with the latest version of coldfusion adobe has made connecting these technologies easier
6492691 when you install coldfusion all the connectors are there already that makes it a lot easier because the configuration was difficult
6492692 as a product it allows you to easily gather data from a database
6492693 so whenever there are updates to the data they basically send that data through a message to the dashboard
6492694 which is the same programming languague used in flex with air you have some additional apis you write the application in the same way except you compile it for the desktop
6492695 some things like expandable windows re sizeable columns and grids can be done in ajax
6492696 but it would take a tremendous amount of coding to customize them would be very difficult those capabilities come natively in the flex apis so instead of having to write this whole set of javascript with html and ajax if you want a collapseable panel you just use a tag and there it is
6492697 the reason coldfusion was popular originally was that the programming was fast
6492698 you dont have to write as many lines of code as you do in java or net in flex its the same way its a tag based language kind of like what microsoft is doing now with silverlight you can do all the basics with tags if you need to do customization you can go in and expand the tag and write a custom component
6492699 its about whats it like to be young black and british in todays society and the issues that young kids face and the problems and the stereotypes they face on a daily basis that a lot of people are not aware of issues between skin tones and the debates that go on between cultures

6492704 religion must use law to empower itself and control the people who they need in order to survive i give you an ability to respond and your response is to be free to love and serve in every situation and therefore each moment is different and unique and wonderful because i am your ability to respond i have to be present in you if i simply gave you a responsibility i would have to be with you at all it would now be a task to perform an obligation to be met something to fail
6492705 if you didnt have expectations and responsibilities wouldnt everything just fall apart
6492706 only if you are of the world apart from me and under the law responsibilities are expectations are the basis of guilt and shame and judgment and they provide the essential framework that promotes performance as the basis for identity and value you know well what it is like not to live up to someones expectations
6492707 honey ive never placed an expectation on you or anyone else the idea behind expectations requres that someone does not know the future or outcome and is trying to control behavior to get the desired result humans try to control behavior largely through expectations i know you and everything about you why would i have an expectation other than what i already know that would be foolish and beyond that because i have no expectations you never disappoint me
6492708 what i do have is a constant and living expectancy in our relationship and i give you an ability to respond to any situation and circumstance in which you find yourself to the degree that you resort to expectations and responsibilities to that degree you neither know me nor trust me

6492710 congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion
6492711 no body cares about your personal religious beliefs so shut up
6492712 the pundits like to slice and dice our country into red states and blue states red states for republicans blue states for democrats but ive got news for them too we worship an awesome god in the blue states
6492713 i felt i heard gods spirit beckoning me i submitted myself to his will and dedicated myself to discovering his truth and carrying out his works
6492714 that i can sit in church and pray all i want but i wont be fulfilling gods will unless i go out and do the lords work
6492715 obama quickly made his personal beliefs central to his presidential campaign he peppered his speeches with references to his faith and scripture
6492716 hey guys pay attention im not interested in having a religious debate or a discussion about obama religious values im interested in decapitating people who think their religious opinions belong in government
6492717 orchestrated or at least deliberately allowed by the bush cheney administration and the pentagon
6492718 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile but is morally treasonable to the american people
6492719 government has a final responsibility for the well being of its citizenship if private cooperative endeavor fails to provide work for willing hands and relief for the unfortunate those suffering hardship from no fault of their own have a right to call upon the government for aid and a government worthy of its name must make fitting response
6492720 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors
6492721 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
6492722 all men having power ought to be distrusted to a certain degree
6492723 i believe in human dignity as the source of national purpose in human liberty as the source of national action in the human heart as the source of national compassion and in the human mind as the source of our invention and our ideas it is i believe the faith in our fellow citizens as individuals and as people that lies at the heart of the liberal faith for liberalism is not so much a party creed or set of fixed platform promises as it is an attitude of mind and heart a faith in mans ability through the experiences of his reason and judgment to increase for himself and his fellow men the amount of justice and freedom and brotherhood which all human life deserves
6492724 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid
6492725 what exactly did you have to do with the win anyway
6492726 believe me theyre more worried about us than we are about them they know whats up

6492730 our study found that the fires in wtc 7 which were uncontrolled but otherwise similar to fires experienced in other tall buildings caused an extraordinary event
6492731 heating of floor beams and girders caused a critical support column to fail initiating a fire induced progressive collapse that brought the building down
6492732 video and photographic evidence combined with detailed computer simulations show that neither explosives nor fuel oil fires played a role in the collapse of wtc 7
6492733 hundreds of degrees below those typically considered in current practice for fire resistance ratings
6492734 while the partial or total collapse of a tall building due to fires is a rare event we strongly urge building owners operators and designers to evaluate buildings to ensure the adequate fire performance of the structural system of particular concern are the effects of thermal expansion in buildings with one or more of the following features long span floor systems connections not designed for thermal effects asymmetric floor framing and or composite floor systems
6492735 we recommend that building standards and codes be strengthened beyond their current intent to achieve life safety by preventing structural collapse even during severe fires like this one when sprinklers do not function do not exist or are overwhelmed by fire
6492736 seven world trade center is one of the key points of evidence one of the smoking guns
6492737 you shall not be partial to the poor or defer to the great but in righteousness shall you judge your neighbor
6492738 masters treat your slaves justly and fairly knowing that you also have a master in heaven
6492739 whos going to rest who and who is going to shut it down for the year
6492740 bringing a ban into all three towns would bring them in line with timaru and would be a good way of managing problems
6492741 there cant be a one size fits all approach to water strategy they want to see local projects and strategies that suit the local environment
6492742 people are also passionate in their views on the uses and benefits of water a comment from one of the people there that really struck me was that water defines us as new zealanders it is who we are
6492743 he will be a breath of fresh air for the world
6492744 i attended classes sparingly drank beer heavily and tried drugs enthusiastically
6492745 it has to get humpback whale milk and there is no way that that can be provided in captivity
6492746 unless it finds its mother or a foster mum its chances are very very small
6492747 2004 marked the first time in the past six election years that more households watched coverage of the republican national convention than its democratic counterpart
6492748 we are for some reason continuing to knock holes in that remaining urban grid the hotel sierra site the old circular gas station at atwells and broadway the old public safety complex the one ten westminster site grants lot what is next the arcade
6492749 i suspect that in many ways the city is encouraging unadulterated demolition developers can bring financially shaky proposals to the table knowing full well that if their financing falls through theyll be allowed to park cars on the vacant lot the procaccianti group has even gone so far as to cry financial hardship about the minimum landscape requirements for a surface lot the city needs to start defending itself against these sorts of predatory developers
6492750 ironically last week i asked my staff to see what was happening there
6492751 the word i got back is that they want to make an appointment with me next week to talk about it that could mean anything it could mean its delayed a year or so and they want to do temporary parking it could mean its delayed six months it could mean anything
6492752 every time something like this happens it makes you sit down and review your regulations and this is one of the things well have to sit down and think about
6492753 ok if this cant be financed what is plan b for this site and dont say parking because that is not an option
6492754 my little boys and girls be good please sit tight the concert is going to begin soon no jumping around ok
6492755 with the money we have gained from the sale we want to help that ice rink prosper
6492756 yeah yeah yeah for the microphone sound check appropriately setting the stage for the show thats about to burst forth into all corners of the room the energy bounces around the tiny bar you can tell its about to get dirty in here
6492757 thats the lowest of the low stealing from a kindergarten they cant afford that
6492758 okay hes dead lets bury him and be done with it
6492759 we thought the idea concept was great execution was lacking
6492760 we and others had demonstrated the existence of a dna detection pathway within cells but we are still early in our understanding
6492761 our findings offer an important piece of evidence that this pathway is not only very relevant but it can be the cause of severe autoimmune disease
6492762 just as commensal bacteria outnumber our own cells by four or five orders of magnitude endogenous retroelements outnumber our genes by at least 100 fold
6492763 both have the potential to be detected by the immune system and cause autoimmune disease therefore specific mechanisms evolved to prevent this and trex1 represents the first example of a mechanism to prevent autoimmunity caused by endogenous retroelements
6492764 it is fascinating to observe how individual proteins can determine addictive behavioral patterns
6492765 in addition our results open up whole new prospects for treating addiction thus blocking the nr1 receptor might protect from relapsing into addiction selective activation of glur1 would even contribute to extinguishing the addiction
6492766 hey it is the rebelious rebels of nigeria that are the problems
6492767 advertising isnt just a short story its a longer experience shared with the consumer
6492768 up to 50 satellite dishes could be based in awarua or on the south coast of southland
6492769 the cost to install and build those dishes would be worth 50 million alone
6492770 you cant go any further south without having accommodation and transport problems
6492771 it is now evident that speculators in the energy futures markets play a much larger role than previously thought and it is now even harder to accept the agencys laughable assertion that excessive speculation has not contributed to rising energy prices
6492772 difficult to comprehend how the cftc would allow a trader
6492773 we have six percent recall and we are too lazy to test ourselves
6492774 its really funny people moan about not getting their mail but we had to wait five years id love to know where its been
6492775 it looks like it rolled under a heater or its been stuck under something people missed out on this wonderful promotion its amazing its made our day talk about snail mail
6492776 it is extremely rare for something like this to happen we welcome hearing about it so we can look into it
6492777 nice young guy who was always going to go places

6492790 i am sure roy carroll has good intentions and probably would like to see an office tower built downtown but i personally dont think that will happen anytime soon
6492791 lets be happy with what downtown is developing into and focus on continuing to promote it as the triad
6492792 what are the things that evolution has at its disposal to define a creature to mix and match the parts and eventually come up with a unique organism thats going to live its life and try to reproduce
6492793 with over 100 000 genes we think we have genes that a lowly fruit fly would know nothing about but this is not true
6492794 all animals including humans have a very similar set of basic genes and yet were so different
6492795 its kind of a biologists dream to be able to design your own animal
6492796 to pick and choose the traits of animal groups that you most enjoy oh my gosh i love this
6492797 there are a lot of communities that will see a significant reduction in rail traffic if the transaction goes through
6492798 this proposed purchase will help improve the quality of life in more than 60 communities

6492811 it doesnt always happen that way with players and im sure if shaun signs he will relish the chance to return
6492812 its a good move for him and a good move for the club we are always looking to improve and he is another good player
6492813 we have a good squad as it is now and we know shaun can play in a number of positions
6492814 g if metallica came out with an album of the band simply farting their songs youd say it was the best album ever
6492815 g you gotta get off the metallica thing its really getting annoying
6492816 you will have to ask reading that im not sure i know there have been enquiries or whatever but nothing has come of it so far
6492817 it is always good to be linked with people but it doesnt mean anything unless it happens
6492818 i will just go out and try to do my very best for reading whatever happens happens but i will always be 100 for reading
6492819 i dont think it is vital i made my debut when i was in the championship
6492820 but it is one of the best leagues in the world and there are a few strikers in the irish squad now who are playing in the premier league so that makes it even tougher for me to try to stay in the team
6492821 the information contained in the fact book will help us strategically plan the next steps in our growth
6492822 we posted the fact book online so information about the university of guam is available to the community at large
6492823 the online posting of the fact book underscores our commitment to accountability and transparency and complements other information already posted online
6492824 common sense tells you that you dont outlaw a business without at least giving them some form of notice or without giving them the chance to fight
6492825 as a result he enters a default judgment there was not even a hearing or witness nothing that was presented
6492826 the power to appoint judges belongs to the governor no one else of course subject to the legislatures confirmation
6492827 klitzkie has not been practicing law for the last 20 years
6492828 and for my son it is so exciting too its beautiful
6492829 you could see the excitement in everyones faces and not only their excitement but the eagerness to begin school you saw it in the kids you saw it in the teachers you saw it in the staff you saw it in every person that is involved in the school they were eager and they were happy to be here
6492830 our kids deserve this these new facilities since we are taxpayers
6492831 once we entered the building his eyes lit up when you compare to the old schools its way way way better you know those schools in the states they are like this
6492832 you know how gas is and its always traffic and rush hours the kids we had to wake them up so early and they try to fight traffic because of john f kennedy high school right its just much easier

6492843 i think ill have my staff get to you its condominiums where ill have them get to you
6492844 think about that i guess if you think that being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy is fundamentally strong but if youre like me and youve got one house you might have a different perspective
6492845 stammi a sentire ti amo pi di qualsiasi altra cosa al mondo senza eccezioni non ti basta
6492846 there is a notable sense of denial of how harsh the prospects have been and continue to be for radio the classic ceo reply is radio is not bleeding as badly as newspapers we concede there is too little radio ad demand but there is also too little rate card integrity and too little investment in radios product and people for the long term
6492847 we deeply regret this incident and apologize for the concern and inconvenience it has caused
6492848 simply handing out condoms and preaching safe sex is a harmful lie we tell ourselves and our children
6492849 when people come into our custody we have an obligation to protect the people that do come in from each other to protect the community from escape so thats why the security is important

6492851 dolores aguilar born in 1929 in new mexico left us on august 7 2008
6492852 dolores had no hobbies made no contribution to society and rarely shared a kind word or deed in her life
6492853 as for the rest of us left behind i hope this is the beginning of a time of healing and learning to be a family again there will be no service no prayers and no closure for the family she spent a lifetime tearing apart we cannot come together in the end to see to it that her grandchildren and great grandchildren can say their goodbyes so i say here for all of us good bye mom
6492854 will the sins of the parents be visited on the descendants even to the fifth generation
6492855 dont be selfish these people need to get to work just as badly as you do

6492857 i am not cursing at you jerk why are you even being like this the bus is full goddamn it there was no room why did you say that there was
6492858 people have to get to work there is plenty of room on this bus if people arent selfish about it why were you being so selfish
6492859 okay forget it forget it its all gravy theres nothing to talk about jesus
6492860 el distrito se comprometi a presentar cada mes en sesi n plenaria un informe escrito y oral sobre la seguridad de bogot para ser sometido a control pol tico por parte del concejo
6492861 no hay inconsistencias las cifras son fidedignas de fuentes seguras de la polic a metropolitana del instituto de medicina legal el representante nicol s uribe tendr algunas dificultades de interpretaci n porque nosotros tenemos la seguridad de que los cotejos que llevamos a cabo en el comit de seguridad y del cual hacen parte las entidades mencionadas son veraces
6492862 no podemos jugar con la ciudad ya que se est tratando de minar una pol tica de seguridad ciudadana que no es s lo de esta administraci n que est empe ada en consolidarla y ampliarla sino que es un patrimonio que se viene forjando hace m s de 15 a os y que le ha dado tantos beneficios y frutos al distrito capital
6492863 esto con el fin de apoyar y crear estrategias de seguridad en bogot teniendo en cuenta que los concejales somos los voceros de las comunidades

6492866 rallying together to denounce apple in offering songs for tibet for purchase
6492867 the predictably hostile response to the album from chinese internet users as reported by an official chinese media outlet reflects continued attempts to suppress any support for tibet at a time of crisis for the tibetan people as well as the level of entrenched misinformation about tibet propagated by the beijing government among the chinese public
6492868 itunes is not being blocked in china from our end but access to the itunes store is restricted in some areas in china this would also explain why its happening to your friends there as well i would advise that you contact your isp about this matter please also note though that accessing the us itunes store outside of the geographic region of the united states is not supported and that attempting to access it while in china is at your own risk
6492869 you hit this ill hit that but eventually we tried to get something melodic that would go from a to b without falling apart thats the long story short

6492872 what does ebs enable in short traditional processing on large datasets and reliable storage for many servers
6492873 many other applications that require running a file system or access to raw block level storage
6492874 we have found that most violations stem from a few common mistakes that can be for the most part easily avoided
6492875 we hope to educate the community of commercial distributors redistributors and resellers on how to avoid violations in the first place and to respond adequately and appropriately when a violation occurs
6492876 too many software projects rely on only one or a very few team members who know how to build and assemble the final released product
6492877 such knowledge centralization not only creates engineering redundancy issues but it also endangers gpl compliance which requires you to provide build scripts
6492878 we also have been working with some of their key software providers to port some of the applications that they have internally natively onto force com for them to use
6492879 and all of that together suddenly we were one of their key technology vendors and it really gave them the ability to sign what we call an enterprise license agreement with us
6492880 having a big hitter commit to developing on force com is really important
6492881 previously those committing have tended to be saas smb players like centive or xactly or midmarket on premise apps vendors looking to get saasy quickly like coda
6492882 talked proudly about not needing to rely on a third party vendors erp but creating its own apps
6492883 so i wonder if that might be a possibility as well as the ability to tailor salesforce crm more to the needs of its sales reps
6492884 guest workers trafficked to kuwait stripped of their passports and forced to work seven days a week at a u s military base while cheated of half their wages
6492885 it would be a horrible turn of events if operation desert storm and all the sacrifices made by u s troops have in some way freed kuwait to traffic in hundreds of thousands of foreign guest workers who are stripped of their passports forced to work long hours cheated of their wages and then beaten and deported when they ask that their most basic rights be respected
6492886 what this does is give producers and processors one more tool in the toolbox to make these commodities safer and protect public health
6492887 there is no residue theres nothing left and certainly no radioactivity left
6492888 im just happy that they would give us the money to put in the sewer line
6492889 the roads are bad the sewer lines not hooked up we cant even hook up power or water we have to run it from the neighbors
6492890 thats the organization that we formed to keep us together to carry on the fight
6492891 thats the money that pays for our needs like paying for the lawyer paying the portable toilets
6492892 thats still pending because were still waiting for the high court
6492893 im still fighting for this because i feel that we were right when we first bought this place
6492894 it is time to move forward and take care of the sewer line
6492895 the well being of the people of guam is also at stake here so the court would like to be upfront with the plaintiffs and make sure they understand they are now responsible for the sewer line
6492896 if they do not put in the sewer line with the courts 580 000 judgment in a reasonable time there could be serious consequences such as contempt
6492897 in light of what really took place the court finds this outcome to be fair and appropriate
6492898 plaintiffs will not be saved from their non payment because the law never supported them in their non payment if they wish to remain at the gill baza subdivision barring a reversal from the supreme court of guam plaintiffs need to work out something with the subdivision developer and start paying
6492899 you can win a judgment but still be unable to collect a penny
6492900 i do not want anybody staying in these homes because they are not safe
6492901 there were a lot of leases issued by jaimie martinez
6492902 specific to those people in talofofo i do not know that they have a legitimate lease
6492903 signing contracts and authorizing leases and he had no authority whatsoever to do that
6492904 you dont lease things for free there has to be some sort of rent
6492905 all of them are supposed to be leased for monetary exchange period any deviation from that is a violation of our law you dont just lease out a government property for no money or for the upkeep of the yard
6492906 luckily i remembered that jaimie gave me the authorization before
6492907 they said let me see it and i gave it to them and they took it from me
6492908 i try to do as much as i can for the comfort of my children
6492909 even if it is only a few hours of tv
6492910 i asked public works if they would let me stay in one of them since these ones are unsafe and they dont want me to stay here anymore but i have never heard anything back from them other than that they say they dont have any money

6492912 if you can join the military you should be able to drink
6492913 talks have taken place it was a positive discussion and we will now move forward together
6492914 this is not about questioning the managers judgement or the ability of a particular player
6492915 respetamos profundamente el sentimiento mayoritario de quienes marcharon el pasado 20 de julio por la paz y la libertad sin permitir el manoseo del gobierno ni la manipulaci n reelecionista
6492916 en una confrontaci n tan intensa como la actual donde se presentan centenares de combates diariamente y miles de hechos de guerra por todo el territorio nacional es entendible que se presenten adem s de muertes capturas de integrantes de las fuerzas en lucha y es l gico que tambi n nosotros y las familias de los guerrilleros presos los queramos libres
6492917 participaci n y presencia de pa ses y gobiernos que brinden confianza

6492973 the secrets of storytelling why we love a good yarn
6492974 psychologists and neuroscientists have recently become fascinated by the human predilection for storytelling why does our brain seem to be wired to enjoy stories and how do the emotional and cognitive effects of a narrative influence our beliefs and real world decisions the answers to these questions seem to be rooted in our history as a social animal we tell stories about other people and for other people stories help us to keep tabs on what is happening in our communities the safe imaginary world of a story may be a kind of training ground where we can practice interacting with others and learn the customs and rules of society and stories have a unique power to persuade and motivate because they appeal to our emotions and capacity for empathy
6492975 empathy is part of the larger ability humans have to put themselves in another persons shoes we can attribute mental states awareness intent to another entity theory of mind as this trait is known is crucial to social interaction and communal living and to understanding stories perhaps because theory of mind is so vital to social living once we possess it we tend to imagine minds everywhere making stories out of everything a classic 1944 study by fritz heider and mary ann simmel then at smith college elegantly demonstrated this tendency the psychologists showed people an animation of a pair of triangles and a circle moving around a square and asked the participants what was happening the subjects described the scene as if the shapes had intentions and motivations for example the circle is chasing the triangles many studies since then have confirmed the human predilection to make characters and narratives out of whatever we see in the world around us

6492987 i see him as the precursor to martin luther king
6492988 not only was he an organizer he was a humanitarian an entrepreneur he was an author he took care of the poor he spoke for the disenfranchised he was the person who was recognized and well respected in both communities african american and the white communities
6492989 the waltons are concerned they dont want to infuse money into this project and then were not able to maintain it and thats a legitimate concern
6492990 the older ladies would teach us how to usher and wear our gloves
6492991 here we are a national landmark building and if we lose it you cant get it back
6492992 i would hate that if we didnt complete this thing you would pass by and say that used to be a national landmark it would be a tragic loss
6492993 i had been attending college at the university of louisville for a year in the meantime they called me up for the draft i went to the head of the draft board and asked if i could get a deferment just to finish up my second semester at u of l i was on the basketball team down there that was when freshmen were allowed to play because they were short of man power due to the war
6492994 the armed services shipped me on a bus to the armory in louisville for examination to go into the service
6492995 but then doctors said when you go through all that 90 day intensive training 10 mile backpack running and your arches break down you will draw a government pension for the rest of your life
6492996 so that fall wendell trapp was the superintendent of education
6492997 so they said you can teach study halls several hours a day take the kids to exercise and coach the basketball team
6492998 wed go to mary dees to get a sandwich or a bowl of soup or something
6492999 so we would go there or we would go to the white cottage after the ball game

6493001 i can remember when the chief of police rode a horse here
6493002 they used to play pinochle back of rush gatewoods place
6493003 we even took the chimney down off bill wheelers farm off covington ridge
6493004 i stayed in that until up until i left there in january of 61 and went up to frankfort and took an exam for an income tax investigator and took the test and a week later they called me back and said i had passed
6493005 i went to back to louisville at the state office building and then i stayed with them from 1961 march the third and retired out on january first 1987 a senior field representative
6493006 i was chairman for oldham county for brereton joness first campaign for lieutenant governor

6493013 the long term consequences of child maltreatment are very real and concerning all children should have safe stable and nurturing environments in which to grow and develop for children and adults to live to their full potential we must support programs that stop child maltreatment before it ever begins and work to help those who have already experienced it

6493017 russia is clearly testing us because our military resources are stretched so thin ive said before we need to get out of iraq sooner rather than later and shore up our afghanistan pakistan issues
6493018 but russia saw they could go into georgia and we would have no real response except saying please get out i think we have to re engage with russia and not just have george bush watching the volleyball tournament in the olympics while georgias getting invaded that perception is very important and i think he needs to take it a little more seriously
6493019 one thing the sen barack obama campaign will reestablish is our rapport with countries all over this globe so that we have the capacity to negotiate with russia when they are pushing the envelope like they did in georgia
6493020 were a campaign of issues for the future of alaska
6493021 while that other noise continues to rattle out there were going to keep a different light on our very positive campaign of what we think is possible for alaskans
6493022 on exploration and drilling im supportive but carefully cautious about it if that makes sense
6493023 im not just going to do it really willy nilly but well do it when the environment is right
6493024 he offers an incredible inspiration to young people and for alaskans he represents a new way of looking at how washington works even though hes a senator hes running as an outsider in a lot of ways we like that in alaska
6493025 the cities have grown up they want to be more established so there are lots of inroads for democrats and for progressives

6493028 whos to say that americans are misguided for craving a little cool in their candidates
6493029 its curious that mccain would disparage the force of this undercurrent in american politics after all he was its beneficiary when he ran in 2000
6493030 internalized the lessons of reagan and bush instead it is mccain who has fallen into the classic democratic trap of equating celebrity with emptiness and broad thematics with a lack of depth
6493031 may not help for one thing unlike gore or kerry mccain has nevef been mistaken for a policy wonk and he flubs important details with some frequency its not as if his command of substance makes obama seem like a marshmallow by comparison
6493032 but the larger problem with campaigning against cool is that it seldom actually works too often when you mock celebrity you also seem to be mocking all the people who get to define celebrity which is to say american consumers in a way mccains celebrity ad could be the 2008 version of gores infamous sighs it says if you really find this character compelling then theres got to be something wrong with you too

6493038 when we felt there was enough evidence to determine criminal behavior on the part of mr singer we reported it
6493039 we have no reason to believe that more department of corrections staff are involved
6493040 this is not something we take lightly it jeopardizes the security of our inmates staff and the general public our intent is to prosecute to the fullest extent of the law
6493041 importantly from a neuroscience perspective while the bee brain is only about the size of a sesame seed it has many of the characteristics of the human brain including complex behaviours such as advanced memory and learning
6493042 our research will hopefully increase our knowledge of brain functioning which will in turn lead us to finding new and effective ways to treat brain disorders like parkinsons disease strokes alzheimers and depression

6493141 in the end it comes down to whether or not mccain or obama can captivate colorados palate through relative fiscal conservatism social moderation with just a splash of populism and energy and environmentalism talk for flavor
6493142 when i heard the decision he made on supporting drilling i said well thats it for california
6493143 if mccain were not running for president then obama probably would have a very good chance of carrying arizona
6493144 i think the chances of him actually defeating mccain are not great but not impossible and my guess is it will be closer than a lot of people think
6493145 mccain has had a love hate relationship in arizona for a long time

6493190 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6493191 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
6493192 we are continuing to work to make sure that any timelines that are in the agreement really do reflect what we believe can be done whats feasible

6493194 today condoleezza rice the occupation foreign secretary arrived in iraq to try to put pressure on the government of iraq to accept terms dictated by the occupation to sign this ominous treaty

6493196 as long as he continues to do a nice job its definitely not a closed situation
6493197 they were trashing it so bad the city got onto me i said the city is the one that needs to help me with this
6493198 to say theyre not bothering anyone or doing anything wrong is a misnomer
6493199 do i think homeless people are bad no but theyre here because its easy and because we werent enforcing public order crimes weve received a mandate from the citizens to clean up the city and take back the neighborhoods so here we go
6493200 the ones that were usually out here giving us problems are in jail right now
6493201 i cant rest i understand some of it i dont like people begging me if youre not bothering nobody why do you have to move where do you want me to go
6493202 our previous work produced important data but it involved short term acute interventions
6493203 this study will be the first long term investigation into whether nutritional supplements and aerobic exercise benefit normal but sedentary older people

6493208 the objectives of the strategy are very well meaning and indeed respond to many of the representations and concerns highlighted by simon in the lead up to the drafting of the strategy
6493209 a detailed implementation plan is essential in order to give this new strategy credibility and ensure buy in from the homeless sector
6493210 the implementation plan should set out where the funding to meet the targets outlined in the strategy will come from
6493211 it should give us assurance that the budget is there to fund the entire strategy over its life span from 2008 to 2013 and not assigned on a year by year basis
6493212 at the moment we have a situation where people are in emergency accommodation not for months but years
6493213 this is something which is totally unacceptable and i as minister do not intend to stand over that
6493214 there is a lack of clarity in the document in terms of the specific actions that will be undertaken the party responsible for each action and the timeframe for delivery of each commitment
6493215 the strategy is not accompanied by any clear financial commitments this raises doubts as to how much if any of it is actually achievable
6493216 it is also disappointing to see no mention of multi annual funding for projects and organisations working to end homelessness
6493217 but putting things on the skin puts them straight into your blood stream

6493223 would have taken away from doctors their professional judgment when a fetus is viable
6493224 physicians are already required to use life saving measures when fetuses are born alive during abortions
6493225 we worked with him specifically on his strategy the republicans were in control of the illinois senate at the time they loved to hold votes on partial birth and born alive they put these bills out all the time because they wanted to pigeonhole democrats
6493226 what this does is give producers and processors one more tool in the toolbox to make these commodities safer and protect public health

6493228 if the judges are not restored we will perhaps be forced to sit in the opposition
6493229 we will not try to bring the government down but of course then we have no choice but to sit in the opposition
6493230 he has been saying to me reinstating the judges minus one the one being the chief justice we have said its not a question of any individual its a question of the institution
6493231 if they are not restored it will be a bad day for democracy it means whatever the dictator did to our country we arent rectifying it
6493232 if this agreement is not fulfilled then how can we justify our stay in the coalition

6493237 a subject who can never fully give an account of itself may well be the result of being related at non narratable levels of existence to others in ways that have a supervenient ethical significance
6493238 we must recognize that ethics requires us to risk ourselves precisely at moments of unknowingness when what forms us diverges from what lies before us when our willingness to become undone in relation to others constitutes our chance of becoming human

6493279 peningkatan kualitas pendidikan menjadi hal yang sangat penting bagi pemerintah untuk ke depan
6493280 pemerintah harus fokus pada pembinaan generasi muda yang bakal masuk ke pasar kerja sejak mereka masih sekolah mereka sangat berpotensi dan mampu menyerap berbagai hal yang bisa meningkatkan kompetensi dan keahliannya sesuai kebutuhan pasar kerja
6493281 minimnya kompetensi dan keahlian lulusan sekolah formal terlihat dalam bursa bursa kerja yang semakin sering diselenggarakan sejak tahun 2006 meskipun peminat setiap bursa membeludak hampir 30 persen lowongan kerja yang tersedia tidak terisi karena pelamar tidak memenuhi kriteria pemberi kerja artinya lapangan kerja tersedia kompetensi peminat tak memenuhi persyaratan yang diminta
6493282 tahun 2008 setiap 1 persen pertumbuhan ekonomi menambah 702 000 tenaga kerja tetapi ada tren semakin besar yang masuk ke sektor informal padahal yang dibutuhkan adalah penyerapan tenaga kerja pada sektor formal
6493283 jika asumsi itu dipakai pula pada penambahan tenaga kerja baru artinya dari 702 000 tenaga kerja baru yang bertambah setiap 1 persen pertumbuhan hanya sekitar 210 000 tenaga kerja yang masuk ke sektor formal

6493293 our dna analysis corroborates what the historical sources say namely that vanilla was a trade item brought to tahiti by french sailors in the mid 19th century the french admiral responsible for introducing vanilla to tahiti alphonse hamelin used vanilla cuttings from the philippines the historical record tells us that vanilla which isnt native to the philippines was previously introduced to the region via the manila galleon trade from the new world and specifically from guatemala
6493294 the pre columbian maya had been managing their forests for millennia to cultivate cacao and to make chocolate and we know they were also cultivating vanilla to use it as a chocolate spice the maya created these forest gardens by introducing different types of species of wild cacao and vanilla from the surrounding forests which meant that species that had previously been geographically separated were then able to hybridize because they were in the same place thats the scenario we present in our research paper for how tahitian vanilla got started it is an evolutionary product but also a maya artifact
6493295 pesach has demonstrated that vanilla species can exchange genes quite frequently across species barriers
6493296 this provides an opportunity to breed new commercial varieties of vanilla through hybridization in the future

6493320 dancing has brought me so much good in my life and the no 1 thing i like to do is learn about different hispanic cultures cause theyre all different
6493321 that way we keep it out of the streets and plus we keep our culture alive they learn the culture from different latin american countries and they learn the culture from texas
6493322 it used to mean choice tip top the best now it means youre half a metrosexual driving a european car but not a cool one while drinking an elaborately prepared coffee based beverage but with no actual sugar or dairy products holding hands with a vegan wackjob somebody thin and pasty and undead like most people in the republican party ironically and not a hotness like say cameron diaz
6493323 id like to get subtle with her in her tofu jiggly ass
6493324 plus most people cant tell you what it means exactly nuance itself has nuance that could make your head explode
6493325 well nuance sounds french because it originated in french you dumb motherfucker
6493326 nuance is good its especially good in a national leader people are different cultures are different
6493327 but president george w bush has taken any of nuance s calls for eight years mission accomplished last throes support the troops or ill wiretap your grandmothers hearing aid the writings on the wall so to speak
6493328 if nuance makes it past this theyre gonna drag it off to guantanamo and clip a car battery to its serifs and fire em up till its nancy
6493329 after two solid months of electrocution on fox news nuance will be weak indecisive hesitant fearful and insecure

6493332 american kids are 16 times more likely to be murdered with a gun 11 times more likely to commit suicide with a gun and nine times more likely to die from a firearm accident than children in 25 other industrialized countries combined

6493342 the first responsibility of a leader is to define reality
6493343 no dependen os fichajes de lo que t deseas sino tambi n de los jugadores de donde proceden y que les dejen venir
6493344 si por algo llevo tiempo en el mallorca es porque conozco la casa tal como funciona con los recursos que tiene y lo que ha hecho durante muchas temporadas para subsistir
6493345 de aqu se han ido grand simos jugadores y el mallorca ha seguido en pie unas veces mejor clasificado otras veces peor pero el aficionado ha seguido viendo f tbol de primera divisi n yo como entrenador lo nico que he hecho es buscar r pidamente soluciones a los problemas y no lamentarme

6493349 implicaci n total con ese proyecto que es important simo para el club
6493350 hay muchas instituciones que est n participando e impulsando el proyecto del nuevo campo pero si de verdad alguno ha sido decisivo en mantener viva esa llama de la necesidad del campo nuevo ha sido la diputaci n y m s en concreto su diputado general
6493351 importante para la historia del athletic club porque a parte de la ilusi n deportiva que tenemos siempre por estas fechas esta temporada vamos a poner la primera piedra del campo de f tbol
6493352 lo hemos comentado muchas veces pero es como cuando se juntan el hambre y las ganas de comer porque ahora era posible el proyecto tras la desaparici n de la vieja feria de muestras despu s del verano en septiembre o en octubre tendremos ya el proyecto constructivo del nuevo campo que va a ser el definitivo y que tiene algunos cambios no sustanciales con lo que se present en su d a
6493353 vamos a disfrutar con un equipo consolidado donde los frutos del a o pasado se van a ver vamos a ver un equipo serio bien plantado con jugadores que ahora est n explotando y apostando por la filosof a tradicional del athletic contando con nuestros recursos y dejando a un lado los fichajes multimillonarios

6493368 forse lhai gia capito non facile crescere ancor meno diventare adulti
6493369 rappresento me stesso ora come sono le mie esperienze sognando brazil vivendo brazil
6493370 we are a small rural district in the bible belt with strong christian beliefs and feel like homosexuality is wrong
6493371 with more than a quarter of the u s gross national product over 2 trillion sensitive to weather and climate events these events substantially impact our national health safety economy environment transportation systems and military readiness
6493372 all 50 states are impacted by these events and many of these events will be exacerbated by climate change
6493373 our concern is that our nation is not prepared for severe weather or climate change because of declining budgets and lack of attention to these threats over the past few years
6493374 we should improve our ability to respond to severe weather events and prepare for the impacts of climate change that will undoubtedly occur over the next several decades decision makers need information on how climate change will affect their local areas but we are hampered by a lack of funding observations and computing power to provide information at this local level
6493375 making our nation resilient to severe weather and climate change
6493376 given the costs of weather and climate disasters we believe these are wise and critical investments
6493377 wed like to see free and democratic elections and to see the committee of inquiry have some new blood on it
6493378 it is only a matter of having to deal with the situation in israel which has been caused by a number of people who want to take over the organisation
6493379 we are an orthodox burial society which is bound by the halachic regulations as relating to all aspects of jewish burial and jewish services
6493380 we have had meetings with representatives of the reform shul it is an ongoing issue
6493381 there has been a long standing practice and agreement which they the hebrew burial society appear to have changed very recently but we sincerely hope that they will revert back to the practice as it has been for many years
6493382 if the deceased was a member of the glasgow reform synagogue i was allowed to conduct the ceremony and was treated with due respect no questions were asked everything went smoothly
6493383 i preferred to be as close to the mourners as possible
6493384 we are a small community here the members of the reform synagogue pay their dues to the representative council and support all the charitable organisations in glasgow
6493385 we should not create a deeper ravine than we already have with the reform
6493386 the work ive been doing will make sure hannah franks name will never disappear
6493387 my father was always very proud of my drawing he had a friend john quinton pringle who was a royal academician he advised my father that i should carry on with art but also that i should get a career and that the art should be the icing on the cake not the whole cake so i went to university but i also went to the art school in the evenings there were very few jews at the art school in those days and my mother had asked a neighbour to help to get me into the school she said it was the hardest thing she ever had to do
6493388 i would lie in bed reciting poetry and i would draw the images that came into my head
6493389 i would bore my brothers every week at our shabbat dinner by reading from job and the psalms these are the ones that inspired me but i wasnt a bit religious
6493390 i only started sculpture to help with my anatomy for my drawing but when i started sculpture i didnt go back to drawing at all
6493391 i grew up with my aunts art in our house
6493392 my dad hannahs brother was a preston gp and had a full set of her prints in his waiting room we used to visit auntie hannah and uncle lionel in glasgow though we couldnt stay as the spare room was her studio the house was full full full of sculptures and drawings hannah would always have an overall on and clay on her hands and it was lionel who always had to make the tea
6493393 hannah and lionel asked me to help distribute some of the sculpture among family and friends when they were looking for a care home to go to i felt weird about this and took the art to the gallery at lancaster university where i work they thought it absolutely beautiful and wanted to show it before it was dispersed that was the beginning then five years ago i made the decision to go all out for five years and to try to have a big splash for auntie hannahs centenary it was the least i could do for this person in my family who has such wonderful talent but its all been beyond my wildest dreams the best thing of course being that hannah is still here with us all to witness it
6493394 to begin with i mapped out all i wanted to achieve leading up to my aunts 100th birthday i dreamed of wildly unlikely things an interview on womans hour a spread in a weekend colour supplement a television appearance all these things and more have actually come to pass yet the highlight for me was without a doubt when i met professor shulamit reinharz at limmud and she arranged for the exhibition to travel to her gallery at brandeis university using various contacts and even through a cold call email i managed to get exhibitions in philadelphia connecticut and manhattan before the works travelled home at the beginning of this year
6493395 if you cant have your own children the next best thing is to have a niece
6493396 the best solution to settle the problems of the middle east
6493397 let a referendum be held in palestine so that the people will decide their own fate he said
6493398 in that case the zionist regime will crumble and its people will have to withdraw
6493399 well last night i decided to make cookies your chocolate amp sea salt cookies unfortunately i didnt have any sea salt so i improvised and used your basic chocolate cookie recipe what i had on hand was some espresso powder cinnamon and turbinado sugar i subbed espresso powder for a portion of the cocoa and added cinnamon i rolled the balls in the turbinado next time ill just sprinkle it on the cookies are amazing what should i call them though i was thinking viennese coffee cookies after the general mills intl coffee they are bring in able as my co workers didnt speak while eating them i got thumbs up from a diehard chocolate chip fan and the smell is absolutely intoxicating thank you for being an inspiration to us all and helping us to think outside the oatmeal box
6493400 we are thrilled to be recognized by field amp stream for the second year in a row
6493401 when jason hairston and i started sitka in 2005 our goal was to design the best hunting gear possible we wanted to think out of the box sitka was the first to bring performance fabric technologies to the hunting market these new fabrics keep hunters dry and comfortable in a wide range of weather conditions that is where we got the name for this series ninety percent of the time this is the only jacket and pant you will need
6493402 we are very proud to be recognized for the innovation and design that went into the solo

6493406 they are outstanding i never know what to expect when the results come out and these are stunning results
6493407 they are a tribute to the pupils and the teachers i am very proud and am delighted for them all
6493408 i am delighted with our pupils excellent results and congratulate them on their achievement and determination to succeed and thank our teachers for their dedication and constant encouragement
6493409 i am delighted with this years gcse results which are significantly higher than last years the results are a tribute to the hard work and dedication of the students and their teachers
6493410 i would like to take this opportunity to congratulate all the students who have done so well in their exams whether they got a s or as or simply a passing grade we are of course particularly delighted with the outstanding results of quite a number of students who got a clean sweep of a and a grades and are very proud of them
6493411 we have been truly touched by a huge wave of sympathy and support we dont know what we would have done without the help of the jewish communities in new zealand
6493412 we are extremely proud of all our students achievements and are delighted that their efforts have been richly rewarded
6493413 these results which are among the best in the country have been achieved whilst our students have dedicated a substantial amount of their time and energy towards learning torah and acting as responsible members of the community this is what is at the very heart of hasmonean
6493414 the best ever percentage of a grades in another year of truly outstanding results yet again jfs students are a source of pride for themselves their families and the school
6493415 i am delighted i worked very hard and it was a demanding combination of subjects but i had done well in previous modules so i was confident
6493416 i might in the future go to university to study maths but for now i am just very pleased that the exams are all over
6493417 i was so pleased i was not expecting it at all and was completely gobsmacked when i saw my results
6493418 too little attention given to the scientific aesthetic creative physical and technological areas
6493419 science physical education design and technology or aesthetic and creative areas such as drama and arts
6493420 the law has tightened up and schools are addressing it there are ongoing discussions with inspectors
6493421 the department for children schools and families recognises that it is working out a strategy how to evaluate it
6493422 may only occupy six or seven hours and be largely confined to english mathematics and some general knowledge the argument put forward by these schools is that many aspects of secular studies are covered in religious studies
6493423 this argument is not without substance since the study of the talmud which is a major feature of religious studies can involve an encyclopaedic range of subject matter as well as considerable intellectual challenge and the development of a range of skills in language and logical thinking however few schools have tried to describe formally how limmudei kodesh contributes to secular knowledge
6493424 its good to win because its never easy to beat riders like bennati and the others after winning sprints in the ster elektrotoer the tour of austria and the tour of wallonie ive been getting stronger and stronger
6493425 im not worried about the vuelta because im confident about my form and my finishing speed
6493426 the men grabbed him round the neck and his skullcap came off during the struggle
6493427 he shouted for help but then went back to where he was staying and came to us the next day what makes this incident so disturbing is the fact it is racially motivated
6493428 this is the first case of this nature we have had reported to us it was a cowardly attack and we will do all that we can to catch those responsible
6493429 we have several chasidim here at the moment and although we are a small community we have regular shabbat services
6493430 we often have groups staying here from religious schools and organisations the community centre is put to good use
6493431 perhaps because there are chasidim here now we have attracted more attention but we have never had any serious trouble before
6493432 this was a shocking attack in an area that is normally welcoming to jewish visitors we hope it proves to be an isolated incident
6493433 they all live in a house and are given tasks where do you recognise that i dont think its challenging any more
6493434 yeah thats why i was really excited about coming back here with the players hes brought in i mean no disrespect to last years team but i think this team as a whole in depth as well is really strong
6493435 floors and chimneys that caved in over the last few decades require urgent conservation to prevent further deterioration
6493436 we estimate our total needs at over 200m zloty 49 5m these are real requirements
6493437 we have taken thousands of students to visit auschwitz birkenau as part of our lessons from auschwitz project
6493438 it is a site for all humanity to learn from the mistakes of the past and thus it is also everybodys responsibility to ensure it is preserved so that its legacy lives on particularly as holocaust survivors become fewer and frailer
6493439 with the under achievement of boys nothing short of a national scandal we are delighted again that our boys get a grades in nearly three out of every four exams they take
6493440 as it was my birthday morning i woke up really early and checked my results straight away on the website
6493441 i had worked really hard but it was quite a demanding combination of subjects and there were a couple of exams i wasnt too sure about so im very happy
6493442 im really delighted it came as quite a surprise as i wasnt too sure how id done but i worked very hard and i am very proud
6493443 it is just something i enjoy but when i go to university i want to do psychology and cognitive neurosciences
6493444 walking on to hampden was a brilliant feeling i loved it
6493445 it was very special feeling making my debut and it was an honour to get on
6493446 there were definitely some nerves but sometimes they get you through a game i will go back to training at falkirk and im sure the boys will cane me as usual it will be back to normal
6493447 but you want to be doing well for your club because you never know whats round the corner in football
6493448 its only one game but it was definitely an opportunity for me to stake my claim for a place in the scotland squad for the world cup qualifiers
6493449 get this oh this is so cute oh you have to have this
6493450 come on zeke you can go to harvard with me we can room together think of how much fun wed have
6493451 im going to xxx small regional college nice enough but certainly not ivy league you should come with me
6493452 compared to most of the rest of the world were obscenely rich we dont need any more
6493453 you should totally come to harvard with me wed have a blast
6493454 in the last few weeks not only one but two ipod repair shops have been accused of shameful customer service and even outright fraud and we want customers to know that not all ipod repair companies behave this way
6493455 it bothers us greatly to hear that folks may have been taken advantage of by a few companies under the guise of good service when all they were trying to do was have their ipod or iphone fixed
6493456 this is just our way of assisting people that may have been taken advantage of and giving them some form of compensation even though our company had nothing to do with the situation in the first place
6493457 idealyst has already been a big hit with our clients but now using our new yahoo idealyst widget they can more easily learn when each new idea or comment has been posted
6493458 oceangrowns mission is in bringing the abundant health benefits from our ocean to consumers worldwide
6493459 as part of the ogi weight management offering it is key to promote an active lifestyle in tandem with supplementation
6493460 the 15 day turnaround offers a support system through a coach helping consumers commit to a lifestyle change the ogilife is proper nutrition complete skincare and a committed approach to weight management
6493461 we probably have as many good youngsters now as we have ever had at the club
6493462 jamie duff iain vigurs and garry are coming through and rory has been on the fringes for the last two years it is time he came through and showed what he can do
6493463 adam rooney is 20 and andy barrowman is 23 so we have the nucleus of a young squad now which is good for me as hopefully i can use my experience to help them
6493464 were approaching retirement in the next six to seven years
6493465 if theres not enough faculty not enough courses we have a de facto enrollment cap
6493466 the school that i want to go to is a state school but its 17 000 a semester
6493467 lewis has got a slight tear in his rectus femoris and hes going to have to sit aside for a short period
6493468 its something he may have picked up towards the end of pre season hence the fact he missed the morecambe game
6493469 he was in great pain after the swansea game where i think he played particularly well and when we had it scanned this week there was a small tear at the top of his thigh
6493470 funnily enough motherwell were interested in signing me before i went south a year ago but at that time clubs in scotland would have had to pay compensation to st mirren for me
6493471 were in for a hard season there are no ifs buts or maybes about it
6493472 this season is going to be a very difficult one because were already up and running and still trying to gel a whole squad together
6493473 im ready to go back into the team if selected
6493474 the partners and everyone at leo abse and cohen are deeply saddened by the news that mr leo abse has passed away
6493475 many of the jewish charities have stayed at the bottom again this year making them among the least transparent in the country it is very disappointing
6493476 there are 10 jewish charities scoring under 40 per cent meaning they would make up the bottom 10 of all the 500 charities we have profiled this year
6493477 it doesnt really take much effort to get over 60 per cent so these charities are not taking transparency and openness very seriously
6493478 theres such a dearth of information about them and they are so reticent that it makes it look like they are trying to hide something
6493479 the manchester fed has totally transformed its attitude to making information available to the public and to informing people about its work ujia has also done fantastically and has totally changed its culture of reporting
6493480 if you keep a clean sheet then you obviously have a better chance of winning or getting something out of a game
6493481 one of the things is that we have competition for places at the back and also in other areas
6493482 we thought seven points out of nine in the first three games would be good so its up to us
6493483 the soldier had started shouting and pointing his weapon at me i realised he wanted to steal the car
6493484 then he shot at the ground near the foot of one of the people i was with i just wanted to get the hell out of there
6493485 it was pretty scary but you dont really think about it at the time you just have to duck and run and try your best to keep out of danger in a situation where thousands have been killed and tens of thousands have been made homeless what happened to a few israeli journalists was a minor detail
6493486 the killings indicate that there are very few places to report safely we call on the international community particularly the osce and the council of europe to impress upon state authorities the need to avoid targeting or in any way putting at risk journalists and media staff
6493487 we have asked the russian and georgian authorities to respect their work we have received many stories from journalists about the difficulty they faced in georgia and at the borders there have been many stories of journalists arrested threatened or physically attacked
6493488 we have not received an answer from the russian authorities but we really hope they will do something to respect the work of journalists
6493489 journalists working in conflict zones often take enormous risks to report news from some of the most troubled parts of the world
6493490 the conflict in georgia has already claimed the lives of at least four journalists and a driver with others facing serious injury there has also been a number of reports of journalists being shot at held at gunpoint and being robbed
6493491 the local authorities must ensure that media staff are not targeted or put at risk in any way
6493492 news organisations also have a responsibility to do all they can to protect the people bringing them reports of the conflict
6493493 she made allegations about her husband before they divorced our investigations have brought into question the veracity of those allegations
6493494 ms lloyd platt entirely refutes the allegations that have been made until the matter is resolved she is unable to comment further
6493495 in the last six months tom wyatt unified the organization and brought renewed focus to our customer target while making the tough changes necessary to get the brand back on track
6493496 put off solving the jewish question till after the war
6493497 created an atmosphere in which the formal written word could gradually be abandoned as a modus operandi
6493498 basic understandings of officials resulting in decisions not requiring orders or explanations
6493499 it was a matter of spirit of shared comprehension of consonance and synchronization
6493500 what began in 1941 was a process of destruction not planned in advance not organized centrally by any agency there was no blueprint and there was no budget for destructive measures they were taken step by step one step at a time thus came about not so much a plan being carried out but an incredible meeting of minds a consensus mind reading by a far flung bureaucracy
6493501 nobody has the eagles or the buffalos right now we bought 2 000 ounces late last week and those were the last 2 000 ounces that we can find in the marketplace
6493502 the market continued to be strong into the third quarter but has softened in august
6493503 if military activity heats up again pipeline flows into europe could be disrupted and that would affect the united states as well
6493504 this is probably about it in terms of a retail gas drop we may be a few cents away from the august bottom
6493505 on the one hand the crude inventory buildup was quite strong but the gasoline draw was also very prominent
6493506 terrified of allowing western countries to build any kind of cushion for the unexpected because it has the potential to return prices to normal or sustainable economic levels
6493507 the slide in the dollar has taken some of the wind out of the bears sail in the energy complex
6493508 if military activity heats up again pipeline flows into europe could be disrupted and that would affect the united states as well
6493509 this is probably about it in terms of a retail gas drop we may be a few cents away from the august bottom
6493510 on the one hand the crude inventory buildup was quite strong but the gasoline draw was also very prominent
6493511 terrified of allowing western countries to build any kind of cushion for the unexpected because it has the potential to return prices to normal or sustainable economic levels
6493512 the slide in the dollar has taken some of the wind out of the bears sail in the energy complex
6493513 mr president we thank you for your inspiration and for what you do
6493514 due to the unprecedented demand our inventories have been depleted
6493515 we are therefore temporarily suspending all sales of these coins
6493516 this whole thing started about the time the ruskies made their move
6493517 it may very well be that the usgovt is preparing for the real financial meltdown by hoarding all remaining gold flows
6493518 we are working diligently to build up our inventory and hope to resume sales shortly
6493519 if i dont have something to sell i lose business
6493520 the situation is strange and doesnt fit the normal supply amp demand economic model
6493521 the suspension is overwhelming evidence that the commodities exchanges are being used as part of a massive scheme of manipulation of the precious metals currency and bond markets

6493570 you can see a constant flow of students walking the sidewalks
6493571 we ran into a problem with getting a couple of lines open at the cafeteria because we only had to have one line last school year
6493572 to see black students white students and hispanic students walking around campus that really sends the message that its a new day our door is open to all races

6493581 shes somebody who got a tremendous burst of later life energy from really coming into her own
6493582 i would tell anybody that comes out at my age or a little younger take it slow personally i was trying to fall in love with love
6493583 i felt that being closeted and just living this dont ask dont tell existence really hurt the cause
6493584 i could not live my life another day being ashamed and trying to hide who i was because there was nothing to be ashamed of
6493585 the message is you have one life and if you can find a way to get to be who you really are before life ends thats a gift
6493586 they were finishing out the card they werent calling about the fraud
6493587 the catch of course is its hard for anybody to prove a document turned in to us is fraudulent so in cases where there are questions if theres information thats not correct we can catch mistakes and put those to the side and not process them
6493588 this is a fraud on the voter and if it could happen to me a former elected official a judge i wonder how many others there were
6493589 even with clear evidence that our program successfully identifies fraudulent cards and identifies them as such to the county clerk you guys still havent reported on the real success of this campaign and your focus is on one card
6493590 i can only go by whats presented and if whats presented is complete and doesnt conflict with anything already existing then by law i have to process that i cant unilaterally say which registrations get processed and which dont
6493591 needless to say i want the voter registration rolls to be as up to date and correct and accurate as possible but i also dont want to prevent any voters from registering

6493610 im so proud of this record everybody played out of their skin
6493611 so far there have been more than 300 complaints to the national consumer direct helpline
6493612 we alerted the authorities to this website some months ago because the prices they were offering for tickets were simply not achievable
6493613 they were offering a weekends camping at these festivals for 200 and that is not a realistic figure
6493614 its max s personally life and either one of us should be able to do what we want personally but were still coming over here and are still a start up band
6493615 were still lugging our own gear around and were trying to win one fan by one fan the tabloids dont say anything about the music so were left with as much work to do
6493616 the strangest was when they came over to la i had five british guys knocking on my door really you guys fly all the way over here for that you almost want to offer them shelter
6493617 weve just finished mixing the record but basically its the record we made when we were in college
6493618 i think because we didnt make it professionally and didnt have any help we just had to figure out to do everything because the record has so many sounds on it like strings and horns max had to learn to write and arrange all that stuff and write out scores we didnt know how to record any of this stuff everything we did was a total adventure
6493619 that means when you get to the second verse something has to be different it has to keep moving so people dont get bored
6493620 music today is static songs have been the casualty so we wanted to make something you couldnt predict
6493621 i realized this is my home time this is what i need to set aside for myself so i dont burn myself out
6493622 the one life solution reclaim your personal life while achieving greater professional success
6493623 boundaries affect performance issues probably as much as any other personal quality
6493624 first pagers then cell phones and access to e mail all of those things are ready intrusions and its addictive
6493625 you have to be able to rest and you have to be able to clear your mind sometimes
6493626 its like trying to find a screwdriver on a messy work bench it takes a lot longer to look for the screwdriver than if you had organized the bench

6493629 once you get in the elderly population they are just a different breed they respond differently
6493630 if you wait for a geriatric patients blood pressure to get below 90 youre going to have a worse outcome
6493631 in the past it was hard to determine if they were hurt really bad or not
6493632 wed think should we drive 30 minutes to the trauma center
6493633 this helps paramedics distinguish injured and the not so injured geriatric patients
6493634 it still surprises me when i hear one of our songs on the radio or see a picture of us in a magazine i still dont get why the hell someone would care to have one of our signatures on something of theirs haha on a daily basis we are asked if not by a journalist then by a fan what it feels like to be famous and yet i still draw a blank every time because to me we are just the same the only true difference between the life we lived before riot and the life we live now is that every little thing every insignificant thing that we do is cared for in some way
6493635 whether it be concern obsession hate a genuine interest or delight everyone has their opinion and we hear them all at some point i really dont mind listening yes it can get old it can be humorous or enraging or just plain sad nothing changes the fact that theres always someone out there coming up with new theories about us new ideas so that they can get a grip or put a handle on who we are i might sound bitter but actually im just a little bit fascinated i still havent really figured out what it means to be known of but not understood in any way shape or form i could fill a hundred pages of lyrics poetry broken thoughts and still never be understood even the slightest its a good thing i just dont get it yet

6493643 late ustad was a unique personification of indias composite culture he became synonymous in the public imagination with the shehnai he played so much that we remember him every time we hear the shehnai
6493644 i compliment the department of posts for taking this initiative in bringing out a postage stamp in honour of this musical genius of our time his legacy which is an integral part of our composite culture will continue to inspire many generations to come
6493645 my mother in law went to the field to work and suddenly fainted we took her to the doctor but he could not diagnose the problem then we brought her here where she has been diagnosed with leptospirosis

6493648 we felt he was credible that he could not have done anything
6493649 he said it was a stupid statement made in a moment of anger
6493650 we cannot ignore that abstinence and fidelity may too often be the ideal and not the reality that we are dealing with flesh and blood men and women and not abstractions and that if condoms and potentially microbicides can prevent millions of deaths they should be made more widely available
6493651 i am extremely disappointed that he did not follow through with his commitment
6493652 i fear we have lost our best opportunity to get mccain in particular to discuss aids especially domestic aids before the election
6493653 as president i will work closely with non profit government and private sector stakeholders to continue the fight against hiv aids by focusing efforts on reducing drug costs through greater market competition promoting prevention efforts encouraging testing targeting communities with high infection rates strengthening research and reducing disparities through effective public outreach we as a nation can make great progress in fighting hiv aids
6493654 combating hiv aids also demands closing the gaps in opportunity that exist in our society so that we can strengthen our public health we must also overcome the stigma that surrounds hiv aids a stigma that is too often tied to homophobia we need to encourage folks to get tested and accelerate hiv aids research toward an effective cure because we have a moral obligation to join together to meet this challenge and to do so with the urgency this epidemic demands

6493667 the in state teams on his schedule are all good teams theyre all very competitive but you always wonder whats the level in florida whats the level in texas different places in the united states were just trying to see where we stand
6493668 i feel the reason for our success is the kids work ethic along with our coaches and mike srock
6493669 we won the state championship game on a weekend and the next monday afternoon we were in the weight room they didnt have to be there our kids are dedicated they work and schedule their vacations around days we are not doing anything which is not many

6493694 if gov pawlenty can shift minnesota into the republican column for the first time in 36 years that will be a significant boost for mccain
6493695 adding a blue state like minnesota basically compensates for the loss of a medium sized red state from 2004 such as colorado indiana or missouri the numbers in this poll hint at a rare chance for mccain to go on the offensive in terms of the electoral map

6494174 this is the last tragedy of south ossetia i have already prepared an appeal to the president of russia and the russian government to recognise the independence of south ossetia
6494175 the caucasus is a russian region we will never surrender to such adventurers as sakaashvili and condoleezza rice
6494176 we would like to be part of russia russia always supports us russia never hurt us
6494177 the tasks of the anti war movement in britain and hopi is threefold one to fight against any imperialist attack on iran and support the iranian peoples right to defend themselves by any means necessary

6494179 should and will if we have anything to do with it have political implications for the awls position as part of the workers movement
6494180 there should be no place for sean matgamna in any principled marxist organisation
6494181 matgamnas filthy apologia should have no place in the workers movement
6494182 so afghan revolutionaries according to both the patronising socialist worker and socialist organiser forerunner of awl should politely refrain from the opportunity to make their revolution until the likes of so or the swp make the revolution in britain
6494183 that is why we say that the blood of afghans progressives is not only on the hands of the bestial mujahedin the imperialists and the traitor gorbachev it is on the hands of all those who refused to defend the afghan revolution you are all guilty and we shall make sure that the working class never forgets your crime

6494189 ewan wrote the scripts and had most of the ideas which were so revolutionary at the time that even charles parker fought them when they transcribed the recordings charles wanted to give them to actors but ewan said no the material was too strong you couldnt give the voice of john axons wife to an actor charles didnt believe it and the actuality was put in against his better wishes
6494190 its great to hear the music done in that way
6494191 id virtually given up i didnt think it would ever happen
6494192 but weve had a fantastic reaction and i havent had any death threats from outraged hardcore folkies well not yet anyway
6494193 when you grow up with something you take it for granted i was always aware of the radio ballads but id never thought of them as being this great groundbreaking thing my dad and i used to fight anyway about politics not that id ever have voted tory but you have to rebel dont you but i like the way lewis has put it into a narrative with a modern context and an overall flavour its not just a case of taking a flat capped northern voice and putting beats behind it hes made something completely new out of it

6494254 i walk to work i walk back from work im at home at 6 oclock in my pyjamas watching television
6494255 its important to be aware of whats going on in your medium
6494256 it gives you an indication of what youre doing right and wrong or gives you something to shake your fist at in defiance
6494257 ive loved television since i was old enough to reach the dial
6494258 television is meaningful to me its frustrating and fascinating all at the same time
6494259 the main thing is keeping the main thing the main thing
6494260 it was like wait a second being in a bands rubbish what you make a record and then tour for two years and the best reaction you can get is 2 000 people going yeah i know this song thats not what i find satisfying about music
6494261 they werent even thinking about success in the first place
6494262 they really dont give a shit about selling records at all i know its a cliche but it really is all about the music
6494263 when they did that second album which is radically different from the first one it was like this hasnt got their breakthrough cover version of hounds of love on any more so theyre not very good i mean i love the album it sounds great
6494264 i love being associated with the futureheads theyre my mates but when you start to see reviews where its like shiny happy popsters from sunderland field music i think what who us
6494265 the people who are into field music in america are the most ardent anglophiles
6494266 but now with school of language its like i love avant jazz combo chicago underground duo and i love post rock act tortoise and yeah the school of language album is pretty cool its very different
6494267 we realised quite a long time ago lets not fight to get on the front cover of the nme
6494268 if we just keep making things of quality maybe theyll take 20 years but people will find us and if that means theres never any huge breakthrough then so be it
6494269 sealed the romantic view of youth as beset by storms and stresses so much so that premature death by suicide or accident was symptomatic
6494270 celebrated him as a misunderstood genius whose youth made permanent by death would never fade
6494271 robert johnson to whom we all owed our existence in some way
6494272 im mostly influenced by pythagoras bach and ray charles in that order
6494273 but if theres such a thing as karma he could be poster boy for it
6494274 when you mention vic godard everybody still goes who only the real cognoscenti know who he is i first met him when i was stood outside the lyceum in edinburgh he was playing with subway sect along with the slits and the jam but subway sect were my favourites i asked if i could carry his gear in i didnt meet him again until 1991 or 1992 geoff travis put us together and i produced vics album end of the surrey people paul cook was his drummer by then and he was a bit cagy a bit protective he thought i was taking the piss
6494275 i was on the same episode of later as they were but i missed them because i was too nervous i heard their album a little while later and loved it the way theyre hairy rough looking middle americans but they sing nobodys gonna love you more they could do well on american country stations but their sound doesnt really slot in there either i saw them at shepherds bush empire they played three encores and people went shhhh in the quiet bits i think that qualifies them as a cult band
6494276 he is the cult heros cult hero especially for the big star albums the third is his masterpiece there are no rules on it none at all most albums have some kind of theme but this is as disjointed as music gets and somehow its sublime hes gone on to influence other cult heroes like the cocteau twins and jeff buckley would i like to meet him yeah we could have a chat over a bottle of white wine but id like to know what kind of mood hed be in first
6494277 skip spence was the drummer for jefferson airplane before he became the singer guitarist and leading light of moby grape his contributions to their first three albums were marked by a wild logic rare even in those extreme times just listen to omaha indifference motorcycle irene or seeing the last is just like syd barretts scream thy last scream being a tone poem of madness and despair institutionalised in new yorks bellevue hospital after a violent episode he travelled to nashville at the end of 1968 to record his masterpiece oar he looked brilliant the cover is one of the most iconic pictures of the period spence died in 1999 leaving a 90 minute or so legacy of some of the most extreme psychedelic music ever made

6494293 so the russians view you as the american side even though there are no americans here
6494294 one other wildcard for 2016 is the exit of the bush administration the undercurrent of anti americanism within the ioc which some say has hurt the u s because of its softball dominance may abate somewhat with a potential administration led by barack obama a rock star in europe
6494295 i think there is great momentum right now to reinstate softball for 2016 due to a couple of important reasons first asian countries have poured a lot of resources into womens softball japan is one example and those countries have a lot of pull with the ioc second i think america is doing the right thing in exporting its knowledge of the game by establishing clinics in europe where there is more resistance toward the game of softball

6494422 the u s health and human services department regulation still in draft form would define abortion as including certain methods of contraception and would prohibit states and other recipients of federal funds from penalizing health care workers who refused to provide those services because of religious or moral beliefs

6494534 in fact relative to inflation workers in ontario and nova scotia are being paid less today than a year ago
6494535 in other words about two thirds of canadian workers live in provinces where inflation has equalled or exceeded nominal wage increases from july 2007 through july 2008

6494553 he lost a lot of money it was bad investments but cycling would have lost him because of it
6494554 it was just to keep him going so he didnt have that extra pressure

6494559 this wasnt just for hayden it was the others too
6494560 weve got a list of targets that we are working very hard on
6494561 negotiations are tough and sometimes they are even tougher than usual we know what we are working towards and we know what our objectives are
6494562 the process of signing players sometimes takes time but fans should be aware we are trying to strengthen up front and sign a new forward
6494563 one of the surprising things is with a concussion youre almost never knocked out mainly one out of ten but its really confusion its often times confusion and difficulty remembering processing and sometimes you dont realize that the parent or coach may not realize until the next day
6494564 the coaches make sure theyre hitting properly thats some of the things were looking at trying to prevent side impacts on the helmut even at practices making sure the kids arent coming in from the side and somebody trying to spear them in the side of the head
6494565 helmet designs and helmet improvements have made significant strides but the problem is theres not a helmet that can totally prevent the risk of concussion the heads moving forward and suddenly stops and the brain has the ability to keep moving

6494574 there are african agents involved russian agents involved and we have got an english agent involved as well so it isnt going to be easy
6494575 the thing is with these sort of deals the more complex it is the longer it is going to take to get sorted
6494576 that doesnt mean that things arent being done correctly it just means things are a little bit harder to get completed
6494577 the deal is not done i dont want to eulogise about a player who has not signed in case it doesnt happen
6494578 but it is no secret we admire the player and wed like to tie something up
6494579 the construction of a new astroturf field coupled with the installation of fieldturf in scully fahey field ensure that our varsity field hockey and mens and womens lacrosse programs all have ideal playing surfaces for their respective sports and expand recreational opportunities as well

6494598 a high oil price makes moving everything more expensive basically
6494599 transportation costs soar and because movement is vital to the modern economy every time this has occurred global economic growth has slowed
6494600 the 1973 74 oil shock devastated the global economy the 1979 80 shock slowed global growth by more than 40
6494601 and during both shocks the united states economy and much of the developed world fell into a recession

6494610 i wrote a judgment a few years ago in which i said there seemed to me to be certain things which were self evidently private i am not sure about that any more
6494611 the very changes that are taking place in the concept of privacy will be a matter that parliaments have to address and courts
6494612 the widespread availability of communications technologies that allow individuals to publish information about themselves that can be accessed by others is unprecedented in our society
6494613 people are only now beginning to understand the privacy implications of social networking sites and user generated content it may be that the pendulum will swing away somewhat from the great enthusiasm for disclosure that we are seeing now

6494705 nepal is one of the poorest countries in the world the average annual income in rural areas is about 500 per household
6494706 its not one of those orphanages where they take them in farm them out or sell them off to parents they create a home for them for life

6494710 the footpath is broken up in a lot of places from my house into the glen eden village
6494711 its awkward being on a scooter youre taking your life in your own hands every time
6494712 the hedges are overgrown and people leave their bins in the middle of the footpaths
6494713 i had to buy a scooter so i could get around
6494714 i feel something should be done about the footpaths instead of using the ratepayers money on those damn stupid statue things that are no use to anyone at all
6494715 waitakere city has a network of around 870km of footpaths to repair and maintain each year and the annual budget for this work in 2008 09 is 1 million

6494719 weve decided to start in manukau this year and where better to start than a place that is supportive and willing to help us take this event to the next level
6494720 the cars are worth 100 000 to 1 million each so people will get to see 25 million worth of cars on display for free where else do you get to see that

6494741 there was nothing i could do i was next to dead
6494742 we had good neighbours and looked out for ourselves but nowadays people dont know us
6494743 but then i realised that is the way the world goes these days
6494744 we havent seen the low cost carrier model here at the airport
6494745 were now starting to see that which i think has got significant upside we see the trans tasman and newer markets in asia such as china and india as being very important

6494753 were going to have lots of fun with her shes going to come mountain biking running and skiing
6494754 a lot of people came in saying they couldnt believe this sort of thing happened
6494755 we ended up adopting out many other dogs as a result
6494756 when we met karen she was just having a look around
6494757 i showed bella off and they had an instant attraction
6494758 this was taken in the gymnasium during the taekwondo event in a match between chutchawal khawlaor of thailand and ma jean moloise ogoudjobi of benin

6494761 comcast could cap the average users capacity and then charge the most aggressive users overage fees

6494763 subscribers should be able to go where they want when they want and generally use the internet in any legal means
6494764 when providers engage in practices truly designed to manage congestion not cripple a potential competitive threat they should not be afraid to disclose their practices to consumers
6494765 for years the fcc declared that it would take action against any internet service provider caught violating the online rights guaranteed by the agency today the commission has delivered on that promise
6494766 tv widgets will enable consumers to engage in a variety of experiences such as watching videos tracking their favorite stocks or sports teams interacting with friends or staying current on news and information
6494767 viewers will be able to use tv widgets to deepen their enjoyment of the programming they are watching discover new content and services or share their favorites with friends and family

6494770 im incredibly proud of what the board and my dedicated team have achieved for mens tennis and i am honoured to have played a part in taking our great sport to the next level
6494771 now that this much needed change has been realised i believe this is the right time for someone new to build on this strong platform
6494772 i leave knowing without doubt that finally our players tournaments and above all our fans have the foundations of a world class sport they truly deserve
6494773 if you actually look at the details these are centrist not left wing proposals the message that hell expand government is a misrepresentation obama talks about a much more balanced fiscal policy than the current administration and mccain does too to the extent that he talks about policy at all
6494774 theyre both running on a platform thatd be an improvement on our current administration but thats a pretty low standard this administration has been a dismal failure
6494775 hes not been running very hard on his policy proposals hes been running a soft campaign till now and mccain has been trying to paint him as a leftist and hes succeeding
6494776 im an obama supporter because i view him as a centrist
6494777 despite his personal failings clinton ran a pretty good government and a policy of fiscal restraint
6494778 will you be the dad of the children i most likely wont have is that how much you like me or is it not even close
6494779 the nato airstrikes that were supposed to allow the soldiers under assault to get out of the trap according to the wounded missed their target and hit french soldiers along with other shots fired from afghan soldiers positioned below
6494780 were the victims of an extremely well prepared and murderous ambush we should not look here and there for other causes
6494781 the planes supplying close air support could not engage because french troops were very close to taliban insurgents and if they had engaged there may have been considerable collateral damage if the bombs had been used
6494782 none of the wounds sustained by those killed or injured were consistent with air delivered ordnance
6494783 attention tends to focus on soaring crude oil prices as the main culprit for the recent bout of inflationary pressure but nearly 10 of the overall increase in imported products is attributable to the chinese factor

6494788 does he have a vision for the domestic side that matters
6494789 you dream of it but so many things can go wrong in the amount of days that this competition takes place
6494790 you just hope that your horse comes up big on the biggest day and mine sure did hes just one of a kind
6494791 when you give people chances and allow them to come back from their mistake great things happen and im a perfect example
6494792 you shouldnt give up on people and people can still do great things in their lives it doesnt matter whats happened
6494793 jeter is not feeding the frenzy of the internet rumors
6494794 umm i have no connection with ciara i think you have me mistaken
6494795 was a mystery then a peril and a political football and now its a research marathon
6494796 nearly three decades on aids has collected all these labels
6494797 may be a long wait for the next name change
6494798 ever be possible for national leaders to focus on a topic that touches so many hot button topics
6494799 remains a distant hope given the lengthy list of failed attempts
6494800 that should be reason enough to fight it but the world should be encouraged by small steps that are paying off and take even more of them
6494801 solely due to state budgetary woes without regard to the impact on the availability
6494802 the state of california has put at risk the access to health care for millions of californians by underfunding the medi cal program
6494803 theres no question this is good news we already have more than half of doctors not taking medi cal patients because of low reimbursement rates so the additional rate cut was going to further reduce access to care for millions of children parents seniors and people with disabilities
6494804 a lot of it is delayed marriage and women getting started a little bit later in life
6494805 there are significant numbers of women in the u s who would choose a career over having a child married or unmarried

6494811 ik zal mijn eigen energie ten volle inzetten om het vertrouwen van aandeelhouders terug te winnen
6494812 momenteel is het inderdaad moeilijk om van infra chocola te maken
6494813 maar nederland is nog lang niet af je moet hierbij niet denken in termen van kwartalen of een halfjaar maar in olympische periodes op de lange termijn zie ik zeker potentie bij wegenbouw
6494814 het gaat niet alleen om goed werk leveren maar ook om het contractueel goed regelen
6494815 als er zich echt grote mogelijkheden voor investeringen voordoen maar dat zal niet op korte termijn zijn dan staat de weg naar de aandeelhouders nog steeds open
6494816 we zijn lager gesloten omdat de olieprijs opliep en daarmee samenhangend de dollar wegzakte
6494817 volgens wellink kan de europese centrale bank niet eindeloos doorgaan met kapitaalinjecties voor banken en verder zei wellink dat het nog wel even kan duren voordat de kredietcrisis voorbij is en de economie weer hersteld is
6494818 fortis beweerde de europese commissie te hebben gesmeekt om uitstel voor de gedwongen verkoop van abn amro onderdelen maar kroes zegt vandaag nooit zon verzoek te hebben ontvangen van de financi le dienstverlener
6494819 dit sterkt de beleggers niet in hun vertrouwen in fortis
6494820 it feels a bit like d j vu to me

6494827 but the main goal of the shield as admitted us secretary of state condoleezza rice is keeping the eu against russia
6494828 when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6494829 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6494830 one of the key reasons for the success of the chevrolet cobalt and pontiac g5 is the lordstown workforce and the strong partnership with the united auto workers and local and state officials
6494831 the cruze will build on the already successful chevy cobalt
6494832 our dealers are asking for many more cobalts than we can build
6494833 epitomizes the global nature of the automobile industry and general motors commitment to deliver a fuel efficient high quality product
6494834 it is the first of a new family of compact chevrolets that will continue the attention to quality fuel efficiency and strong value promise of vehicles under the chevrolet brand
6494835 the chevrolet cruze was designed and engineered by our global teams in europe and asia pacific and will be manufactured in those regions in addition to the assembly plant here in lordstown ohio
6494836 our goal for the chevrolet cruze is to lead in fuel economy in this very competitive car segment
6494837 the investor class is buying back oil as a hedge because the value of the dollar is weak

6494867 for the time being there are no plans for fry street village until the cvs drive through is approved
6494868 i think they need to contact their city council members and ask them why nothing is being done with that space
6494869 i think that we are losing that denton feel and how fry street was and how people remember it
6494870 actually it might as well just be a parking lot because i dont think they are going to get much further than that for a while

6494874 i am appealing to anyone who witnessed the ahmed fall from the tower block and anyone who witnessed events prior to him fall to please contact police

6494901 also the idea of playing silent photocopies of a distorted face smushed up against the glass of a photocopier in sequence to make them appear as though they are singing fit well with the songs title silence in conversation the silent photocopies were going to do the singing i also thought the rapidly changing photocopies and the rough degraded aesthetic would really enhance the energy and rawness of the music
6494902 first i filmed a tight headshot of colm singing then i made the footage black and white upped the contrast and brought down the frame rate to 8fps
6494903 we started making the photocopies of colms face he had to move his face as the copier light passed to create the distortions this is a technique i discovered with my friend steve when we were in messing around on the school photocopier many years before
6494904 we made hundreds of photocopies with all the main mouth vowel and facial shapes needed for a strange type of lip sync the lip sync was eventually created by laying down all the photocopies on the floor walking around with the printed filmstrip reference and matching each frame on footage with a distorted photocopy that looked similar every photocopy was then blue tacked to a greenscreen and shot with a digital camera in sequence once the sequence was played back at the same frame rate as the reference material the photocopies began to sing
6494905 i shot the live action sequences in the bands rehearsal studio against a whitescreen with each band member playing separately
6494906 in an effort to recreate a photocopy effect during the live action sequences we crumpled the whitescreen slightly and had somebody shake it from behind to alter the shadows
6494907 originally i intended having everything taking place within one of the rooms in the flats but in the end i just used some of the footage at the beginning as a sort of inside out establishing shot i also shot a sequence of the photocopier from above with the lid off so that i could capture the copier light passing i later used this as the effect of the horizontal light moving across screen
6494908 whilst i was making the facial photocopies i also made about 50 blank dark photocopies and 50 light ones to create matt loops
6494909 i then photographed these dark photocopies on a greenscreen to create an image sequence offsetting them slightly and sometimes piling them on top of each other
6494910 behind this layer i placed the dark photocopy loop so that all the black in the picture was replaced with dark photocopy texture i then precomped those layers and keyed out the white placing the light photocopy loop behind it i added a little wobble to the layer of live action to match the wobbles in the loops because of the changing lighting and the constantly moving crumpled whitescreen each frame looked like a degraded photocopy i did this with each piece of footage for each of the band members and synced each clip to the song i then had each clip turned into photocopies as wide medium and tight then i could simply drop them into the comp alongside the main lip synced image sequence of colms photocopied face
6494911 the biggest challenge with this piece was getting the lip sync right
6494912 i was basically trying to create the illusion of lip sync from a squashed up distorted face which was quite tricky to get right
6494913 be it checks written to the university or the ministry
6494914 funnel exceedingly large sums of money through the university each month that was not used for any legitimate university purpose
6494915 due to the absence of any facts regarding the alleged transaction and the gag order entered in pending litigation oru is unable to comment further
6494916 to raise money for a purpose and then not use the money for that purpose many times this is where ministries have gotten in most trouble in the past years with the irs
6494917 its just another example of how ministries need real oversight
6494918 money earmarked for specific university departments went into an unmarked fund
6494919 i was told this is the way things work if you dont like the way it works maybe this isnt the place for you
6494920 if all of this money is coming in i thought theres got to be some money to help keep me here
6494921 a number of measures in place to safeguard the finances of the university
6494922 i think its disgusting to hear that money that honest people sent to help needy students went into other peoples pockets
6494923 we need to get the word out that this is likely to happen but as a practical matter leases have been signed and properties bought for this school year
6494924 this is a major concern with many residents it was the number one problem expressed when we visited residents on national night out

6494926 sir i have found you an argument but i am not obliged to find you an understanding
6494927 no man but a blockhead ever wrote except for money
6494928 essentially economic analysis consists of 1 an understanding of the categories of action and an understanding of the meaning of a change in values costs technological knowledge etc 2 a description of a situation in which these categories assume concrete meaning where definite people are identified as actors with definite objects specified as their means of action with definite goals identified as values and definite things specified as costs and 3 a deduction of the consequences that result from the performance of some specified action in this situation or of the consequences that result for an actor if this situation is changed in a specified way and this deduction must yield a priori valid conclusions provided there is no flaw in the very process of deduction and the situation and the change introduced into it being given and a priori valid conclusions about reality if the situation and situation change as described can themselves be identified as real because then their validity would ultimately go back to the indisputable validity of the categories of action
6494929 for it would be an absurd undertaking to banish from the language of economic theory every manner of speaking that is not literally correct it would be sheer pedantry to proscribe every figure of speech particularly since we could not say the hundredth part of what we have to say if we refused ever to take recourse to a metaphor

6494932 the total complex of the rules according to which those at the helm employ compulsion and coercion is called law yet the characteristic feature of the state is not these rules as such but the application or threat of violence
6494933 no socialist author ever gave a thought to the possibility that the abstract entity which he wants to vest with unlimited power whether it is called humanity society nation state or government could act in a way of which he himself disapproves

6494940 i can see 21 t 72 tanks moving towards the roki tunnel in the direction of russia
6494941 i can also see four grad artillery launchers several and heavy trucks ready to move into the tunnel
6494942 there has not been much evidence of any significant russian withdrawals
6494943 these principles allow the russian peacekeepers to take additional measures to ensure security in the security zone
6494944 they dont show any sign that they want to give up control
6494945 it looks like the word withdrawal is understood in different ways by different people
6494946 i can only say that russia needs cooperation with nato no more than nato needs russia
6494947 what we have just seen is atrocious there are russian interior ministry special forces bringing old people from villages basically emptying the villages on the south ossetian side and dumping them in gori

6494949 any attempt to try and bridge the gap between israel and the palestinians in any way other than a detailed agreement may lead to violent clashes
6494950 the pressure the international pressure this can lead to clashes this can lead to misunderstandings this can lead to violence as we had as we faced after camp david 2000 and the circumstances in a way are similar

6494963 my dream has always been to enter the movie theater with a first class high quality movie that is grippingly interesting but also is true to the biblical storyline and that was diluted in the first attempt
6494964 but lord willing we are going to see this thing made into the movie that it should be
6494965 its a golden opportunity for the christian community to come up with a stellar performance that will have millions of people come to it
6494966 when you approach communities and suburban communities especially that have a higher concentration of wealth and more highly paying jobs you often find that the church communities and the pastoral staff and their salaries are going to increase accordingly
6494967 and also as you go into poorer rural communities the communities that just dont have the influx of capital as a suburban or urban area would have the church salaries are going to decrease proportionally as well
6494968 when there are fewer children around the society tends to turn against children overall
6494969 theres almost a hostility toward children and that society can lose a part of its soul when it has a hostility toward children and especially loses a vision for the future if there are fewer children around to remind them of the reasons why we need to be working for tomorrow not just for today
6494970 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6494971 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6494972 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6494973 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6494974 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6494975 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6494976 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6494977 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6494978 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6494979 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6494980 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6494981 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6494982 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6494983 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6494984 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6494985 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6494986 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6494987 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6494988 we prayed and hoped and trusted that the lord would help us and then eventually a situation came up where the property owner was prepared to sell and using a third party the city had someone buy the property
6494989 then the city bought the property from them and closed the establishment
6494990 it was a scourge on our community and we knew it but we had come to the point where we thought we were almost hopeless outside gods miraculous help and we finally got the victory and a great one it has been
6494991 and the library said no this looks like a religious service and we dont allow religious services in our meeting room
6494992 and they prohibited the event which necessitated the lawsuit and the federal judge said that such an exclusion is viewpoint discrimination
6494993 the only wall that separates religious groups from public meeting rooms is the wall built by government officials who fail to understand the constitution
6494994 and this is a classic example of the library officials not understanding what equal access means
6494995 i dont know how you can do that if youre a serious evangelical pastor and are pro life given what barack obama has said publicly about his extreme views on abortion
6494996 im glad somebodys going to be praying at the democratic national convention
6494997 but i certainly hope that pastor hunter when speaking in denver prays for the unborn children who have been destroyed because the democratic party supports and has supported for decades abortion on demand
6494998 if you take a look at naral the most radical pro abortion group in the united states they are proud to tout him as having a 65 percent voting record in agreement with them now my point is simply this if you are going to agree with the most radical pro abortion organization in the country two out of every three times that you cast a vote on that subject theres no way in the world you can logically be called pro life
6494999 sell the message that they have gotten beyond their anti catholic reputation
6495000 i am absolutely of the opinion that lowering the drinking age will result in more deaths not less and will result in more binge drinking not less binge drinking
6495001 you know the purpose of leadership is not to get off the hook its to accept the fact that theres a problem and to do something about it and i think enforcement of the 21 year drinking age is whats lacking and they dont want any part of that
6495002 they need to say these are the laws these are the rules and i will not tolerate breaking the rules and theyre not willing to do that
6495003 they are willing to do that when it comes down to issues like cheating and so on and so forth but not when it comes down to issues like drinking

6495012 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6495013 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6495014 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6495015 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6495016 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6495017 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6495018 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6495019 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6495020 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6495021 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6495022 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6495023 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6495024 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6495025 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6495026 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6495027 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6495028 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6495029 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6495030 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6495031 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6495032 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6495033 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6495034 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6495035 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6495036 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6495037 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6495038 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6495039 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6495040 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6495041 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6495042 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6495043 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6495044 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6495045 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6495046 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6495047 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6495048 whether its going to a school board meting or maybe joining the school board going into the schools to see whats going on demand something locally we have to do this work before and after the election
6495049 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

6495055 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6495056 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6495057 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6495058 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6495059 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6495060 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6495061 who are open to doing something on the production side
6495062 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6495063 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6495064 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6495065 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6495066 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

6495070 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6495071 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6495072 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6495073 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6495074 i particularly hope he strengthens his economic message even senator obama can speak more clearly and specifically about the kitchen table bread and butter issues like high energy costs
6495075 its fine to tell people about hope and change but you have to have plenty of concrete pragmatic ideas that bring hope and change to life
6495076 my top schools where i want to apply to are oxford and the sorbonne

6495079 though there is evidence both for and against the existence of a detectable anthropogenic signal in the tropical cyclone climate record to date no firm conclusion can be made on this point no individual tropical cyclone can be directly attributed to climate change

6495088 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6495089 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

6495096 this is one house we dont want him to have
6495097 the french revolution produced the saying no enemies to the left a mindset that has poisoned both the left and the right in american politics as a result some figures who should be repudiated have instead become prominent representatives on the right in particular the go along to get along approach has created a movement where the bad guys are protected and the people who get promoted are those who make friends not waves
6495098 the continued tolerance and prominence of jerome corsi his books columns and appearances
6495099 is embarrassing for the right embarrassing for republicans embarrassing for conservatives and libertarians embarrassing for all of us
6495100 t here is one enormous problem with jerome corsi hes a habitually dishonest buffoon who will say absolutely anything to make a buck hes the rights michael moore except that michael moore has much more talent and certain boundaries beyond which even he wont go
6495101 keep in mind folks this is the same lunatic who has been running around for years telling people that george bush is going to somehow personally merge the us canada and mexico over the objections of the american people and congress in other words jerome corsi is a conspiracy nut whose credibility level is zero
6495102 oh yeah lets put this embarrassing nutjob on point in the attack against barack obama what could go wrong
6495103 it isnt just that corsi himself is a conspiracy theorist and a crank or that his best selling farrago of innuendo and outright smears exemplifies everything thats wrong with a certain sort of right wing publishing or that david freddosos the case against barack obama demonstrates that its perfectly possible to write an anti obama book without descending into the fever swamps its that this is an election where conservatives need to be very very conscious about the importance of line drawing if the right is going to resist the ongoing attempts by obamaphiles to define various sorts of normal political elbow throwing cutting ads making fun of barack obamas political style calling attention to the controversial public utterances of michelle obama and jeremiah wright etc as inherently racist and hatemongering conservatives need to be very clear about where the line actually is and what sort of attacks are actually beyond the pale and worth condemning
6495104 corsis approach to politics is both destructive and self destructive
6495105 conservatism has been an intellectual home to people like burke and buckley the gop is the party that gave us lincoln and reagan it seems to me that its leaders ought to make it clear that they find what dr corsi is doing to be both wrong and repellent to have their movement and their party associated with such a figure would be a terrible thing and it will only help the cause of those who hold both the gop and the conservative movement in contempt

6495125 the continuing growth in the number of unemployed nevada workers is a result of the states difficult economic condition its important that state government do everything it can to encourage the creation of new jobs and attract new businesses to nevada this includes resisting pressures to increase taxes on business to meet the states revenue shortfall which would put even greater strains on already struggling companies and put more nevadans out of work

6495174 esatto bisogna esigere da ciascuno quello che ciascuno puo dare
6495175 lautorita riposa prima di tutto sulla ragione se tu ordini al tuo popolo di andare a gettarsi in mare fara la rivoluzione ho il diritto di esigere lubbidienza perche i miei ordini sono ragionevoli

6495200 te imaginas que feo ha de ser trabajar en una fabrica
6495201 im sorry miss ashley i was really an idiot to cast a spell on my comrades and even my own brother i must have been completely lost in my own mind
6495202 thanks for the mind trip master ang next time try aiming for the lunatic only
6495203 you are still the same as when you were my student ben you passed that test how was it
6495204 brutal as always master ang but i met five interesting master two female masters a large master a master my size and master bartimus omega hinsu they said that i was like you master ang you never told me you had lost your wife
6495205 you never asked about my past so i didnt see a reason to bring up history
6495206 i saw that coming most old people use that line if you dont ask then they dont tell you anything by the way why are you limping so badly you had no problem earlier kicking master ben in the gut and send us flying back into the house
6495207 but i have no problem telling you hahahahaa who would have thought the strong fang would get kicked in the groin by a young lady ahahahahaha
6495208 that really hurt artemis master law and myself when we saw that happen but it probably hurt master ang more
6495209 well when a man wont leave you alone thats the best weakness to go for both hug trent but we wouldnt do that to you trent sama
6495210 i thought the same thing apparently they want to marry my little brother
6495211 well while you were the teddy bear of akamaru village he was the one all the girls thought was cute because he was younger and looked up to you and hiroto two of the strongest from the village master ake and i just moved there when we wanted to hiroto was kind enough to allow us to stay when we said we wanted to train his sons
6495212 they really called him a teddy bear hes not much like a teddy bear to me
6495213 they sure did all the girls were jealous of maria because he would only smile for her but he would protect everyone in fact there was a tiger that started to attack a pinic party that had a lot of the girls from the village and ben came to their rescue the cub stopped training and rushed to them and saved them by stabbing the tiger in the head this particular tiger was as tall as a tree needless to say the village had a roast no use letting all that meat go to waste
6495214 so much for not bringing up the past master ang either way everyone im sorry for casting a spell on all of you
6495215 it looks like the blood link is working what happens to the warrior happens to the blade so if ben dies reaper will die as well how reaper will die is beyond me claw help me move this cub back to bed
6495216 thats bens new shirt his old one was torn up by my training session with him he then burned it will a low level fire spell
6495217 i thought he would hold onto that thing forever maria made that with her own hands
6495218 i do believe that ashley chan was the one who got this shirt for him from a village near where we were at last its ironic that the shirt is the same color as his mana soaked aura
6495219 his green aura becomes purple what about trent im sure he has tried magic by now
6495220 he also has green for his aura but his mana soaked aura is orange it was reflected in coatl that sword became bright orange and he performed an earth spell i wouldnt expect anything less from akes student and those kunoichi are also something their jutsu is similar to spells and they love snakes which when trent said that he uses viper sword style they really loved him
6495221 and that would be their summoning jutsu they told trent about
6495222 is that the panel from the floor and if so why is it still on reaper
6495223 no one could pull reaper out so we did the next best thing remove the ground along with him when baka san wakes up have him fix it because it was his blade that has the panel and clothing right now
6495224 after everyone tried to pull reaper out trent and the girls went outside and artemis went to the toilet and then we came up here after removing the floor panel
6495225 do you love ben miss ashley ashley blushes you seem to spoil him with affection a shirt bringing his sword up here staying by his side during the spell and then telling him to take care of himself
6495226 if you do love him tell him bear blade users are known for a lot of things magic energy wave thinking and being dense you have to beat things into their minds so they understand isnt that right fang
6495227 master walker was sure to beat the history into our minds if we missed a question in his test he would hit us with his cane after i told misa about our training with master walker she jokingly said that she was surprised i wasnt as dumb as a doorknob with being hit with a cane for missing quesitons
6495228 yes his name was master patrick arnold walker he wasnt just my master he held the record for the most students to master bear blade style we were his last two lets see he had over twenty students who mastered the bear blade so i wouldnt be surprised if there are more masters in this generation then our own i only had one student ben
6495229 lets go have some tea fang you can tell me about your escape from the magos
6495230 i wonder by any chance was your masters nickname paw
6495231 artemis where did you go after you left akamaru village
6495232 i went around the continent looking for love and spells koron was kind enough to write down some spells that would be useful so i mastered them first i would never have guessed that keith would betray the village like that
6495233 that would explain why he didnt stay down after i rammed him into that rock
6495234 roco be nice after all after i escaped from my cell i came right to you of course a lot of the warriors followed me and retrieved their weapons so they could fight their way out
6495235 last i saw him he was heading south he knows the basic geography of the world because he studied a map i brought with me when i came into the village he knew there was a small gap between lyran and harpina down south knowing him he went to see if what the magos said was true
6495236 little justin long time no see i didnt recognize you as a cane master claw must have perfected that spell huh
6495237 you two have brother blades as well just like coatl and reaper
6495238 we made our swords out of the same pot of steel the fact that coatl and reaper are brothers is because they come from the blacksmith shop at the same time but ben and trent used shinki from the same shinki vein reaper being made completely of shinki was a weird idea on bens part im surprised it hasnt broke yet drinks tea i think i will lay down for a nap this place is peaceful i should be able to fall asleep real quick
6495239 lets get some of our own training done blunt maybe i can break that sleeping problem of yours
6495240 our results appear to demonstrate that vigabatrin induced satiety in these animals

6495245 the bride and groom symbol or words are in most cards
6495246 it becomes difficult to find some that are neutral but have some style
6495247 the fact that you have someone like hallmark going into that niche shows its growing and signals a trend
6495248 we are doing our own investigation into how to strengthen the p card system so this doesnt happen again
6495249 la vida es como una caja de chocolates nunca sabes lo que te va a tocar

6495379 and the idea was brought up awhile ago and some people were saying its not going to work because its country but brooks and dunn do a pretty lively show if youve ever seen one its going really well and were having a good time doing it too
6495380 we ought to really do a club or two or a small theater just for fun
6495381 were going to do a show here so you get it use as many cameras as you think its going to take as far as extra stuff well provide that
6495382 we are the proud home to many large thriving businesses and their headquarters such as labatt usa
6495383 you and i both know better and our players do not feel that way
6495384 the thing that our american fans dont understand is that weve learned from other international coaches from the way they conceive their systems from individual players
6495385 basketball is played at a high level all over the world thats why a third of the nba is international i mean why dont we come to the full realization that there are a lot of really good players and a lot of good systems all over the world
6495386 most people think coaching is just showing up at the game at 8 oclock
6495387 there is no impossible in the world of sports absolutely not not in todays basketball world you could have said in 92 it was impossible for that team to lose and i would have agreed with you but in todays world no thats the farthest thing from the truth somebody gets hurt a key guy gets in foul trouble somebody shoots 65 percent like greece did against us a couple years ago there is no impossible in sports like they said thats why they play the games and these last two games should be great games
6495388 i think its a good idea if it can help out the umpires
6495389 some of these stadiums especially the new ones are so difficult to tell if a ball is a home run or not i was in detroit standing in right center field during early bp someone hit a ball that looked like it went over the fence i said thats a home run then someone told me no it isnt it hit the wall first these umpires have to make that call from 100 feet away at least i couldnt tell i got it wrong and i was 10 feet away
6495390 i dont know if its a good thing but its the right thing to do
6495391 when something can determine the outcome of a game you have to get it right
6495392 this is good for baseball were not going to lose an important game in september or an important game in october because someone missed a home run call our players like the idea everyone likes the idea were just trying to give nearsighted umpires some glasses
6495393 the umpires are in favor of it not because weve made a lot of mistakes but because we cant see the calls we cant see the plays there was a time when there were two yellow poles and a green wall if the ball didnt bounce back on the field it was a home run if it did it wasnt a home run now we have flowers on the outfield fence in philadelphia we have foul poles that are set a few feet back from the fence we have backsplash on outfield walls and the monster seats in boston its so much more difficult now we cant see the calls
6495394 we just want to make sure were all speaking the same language
6495395 i dont need to be carrying a red flag in my pants
6495396 if they can run back and check it in five minutes thats less time that a normal argument would take cubs manager lou piniella takes a lot longer than that when hes kicking and screaming

6495451 another movie he directed brainstorm was originally designed to highlight a projection technology he was promoting the movie was about recording experiences in the film the recorded experiences were going to be played at 48 frames per second as opposed to the standard 24 frames per second his feeling was that audiences had gotten used to the look of standard film people were subliminally aware of the 24 frame per second flicker by projecting the film at twice the standard rate the flicker was harder to perceive and the film would be given that much more immediacy however it was impossible to convince the theater owners to install the special projectors to show the recorded experience sequences the movie was released as a conventional film fortunately the story stood up well on its own partly correct showscan runs at 60fps when he was doing test work for 2001 i believe it was on the spacewalk footage but its been years since i read up on the process and things have blurred for me he accidentally ran a sequence at 60fps and the uniform reaction in the booth was shock that hed gotten a 3d effect with a conventional camera he did dream up brainstorm to use the process but the studio hed been working with didnt want to install the only projector on the market that would run 60fps for an extended period without breaking for just one film and he ended up taking the story idea with him to mgm as i remember it he had to do a sizable payout to get it from his previous studio even then mgm wouldnt go for it compare and contrast with the ua chain which installed a highly sophisticated 3d system in a number of their theaters including seattle and ended up offering a couple of million dollars as a bounty to get someone anyone to shoot a feature using it there were several showscan shorts shot the one at expo 86 the one on magic tricks starring christopher lee and it looked like hed finally get them in widespread distribution when he signed a deal with a major restaurant chain to add a showscan theater to each of their restaurants but the chain was chuck e cheese and the deal was about two months before they imploded of all the reviews i read about the process the one that stuck with me was the one in cinefantastique that said makeup technology was going to have to improve greatly if the process was going to catch on you could apparently see every pore on christopher lees face

6495479 this study will be the first long term investigation into whether nutritional supplements and aerobic exercise benefit normal but sedentary older people

6495482 comcast changed its story and admitted that it did target its subscribers peer to peer traffic for interference
6495483 the company initially claimed that it did so only during periods of peak network congestion and of heavy network traffic later confronted with yet more evidence suggesting that interference was not limited in this manner comcast recast its position yet again and admitted that it interferes with peer to peer traffic regardless of the level of overall network congestion at the time and regardless of the time of day
6495484 comcast has unduly interfered with internet users right to access content and applications
6495485 comcasts interference is far more invasive and widespread than the company first conceded
6495486 the commission found that comcast monitors its customers connections using deep
6495487 contrary to published reports those impacted were distributed across our organization rather than focused on a single department also contrary to published reports the layoffs were unrelated to any ongoing discussions to divest a portion of our business that claim is irresponsible journalism and outright false
6495488 we never had such an agreement all we said in march was we were cooperating with bittorrent on doing tests on how we deliver peer to peer content on our network and to find out if there was a more efficient way to deliver those bits given that p2p hasnt always been as efficient running over networks as it could be
6495489 with respect to bittorrent the fcc announcement is about our managing our network by delaying a certain number of peer to peer file transfers were moving to a protocol agnostic network management so all protocols will be treated equally our march agreement with bittorrent continues
6495490 it does hurt them and they are still competing with what is largely a traditional distribution market cable satellite or dsl and we still live in a world of good enough if i can get through a set top box get most of what i want why set up a bittorrent hub
6495491 this is truly the bandwidth olympics that we had anticipated with broadcasters requiring added bandwidth to support the high definition television broadcasts as well as the thousands of hours of streaming video broadcasts
6495492 by providing the bandwidth that is enabling this vastly expanded online coverage we expect this olympics to set a new record in terms of the number of online viewers surpassing that of the athens 2004 olympic games add to this the millions of user generated video clips from the audience that are being uploaded on video sharing web sites and it should come as no surprise that this will be the most watched olympics ever
6495493 supporting the communication needs of the olympics was one of the key considerations for landing eac c2c into qingdao
6495494 our next generation network currently supports the broadcast and communications channels across the 37 olympic venues carrying ip based video streams high definition television broadcasts as well as provisioning high speed internet access
6495495 additionally with eac c2c having dual landing points into china we offer the diverse paths and the capacity to provision more capacity if necessary
6495496 the capacity on eac c2c has already lent to the successful broadcast of the opening ceremony of the beijing 2008 olympics on 8august 2008
6495497 our capacity will also play a critical role in the broadcasting of the closing ceremony on 24 august 2008 which we expect to be just as well watched and hence demand similar capacity requirements

6495773 ive never experienced nothing like this in all my life
6495774 down there is where you develop up here its a pennant race if you ask if the decision was right id say it was
6495775 tough situation were in a pennant race and were in boston and a lot of focus is on him and he feels the responsibility
6495776 i think coming into this game we were all excited about watching him pitch but the way it unraveled makes it kind of obvious we had to do something
6495777 against boston youve got to be able to hit with men on base
6495778 youve got to score when you get opportunities to score because you never know if youre going to have enough runs
6495779 it was tough early but he kept us in the game hung on right there and he gave us a chance to come back
6495780 he kind of figured it out a little bit he went through a rough start but he ended up pretty good
6495781 he secured the stick in my hand and i thought it hit my hand but i dont think it was in all the way if it hits your hand you should have it im a veteran ive never dropped the stick in my life its upsetting
6495782 tyson gay is a very humble guy i know its my job to put the baton across i did not do that i thought he had it i let it go and he dropped it
6495783 the stick was there the stick had a mind of its own it popped out it wasnt either of ours fault
6495784 if people want to assess blame to me thats ok i can take it i thought the baton was secure and i let it go its very heartbreaking
6495785 you dont become a champion without being mentally and physically tough and you know what i showed up and got it done
6495786 i said nothing is going to get in my way i said before the race this is my domain and im going to get it done
6495787 i ran the best i could i just didnt have anything at the end im disappointed it happens its a long season i started back in february its now august the body can only take so much
6495788 that was the only thing i could think of and it got me the bronze it was a last second decision i had to go for it
6495789 i spent a long time on the telephone with colin powell on the sunday before the vote and colin powell assured me they were going to do all of the planning necessary they were not going to rush to war he assured me that they were going to do all the inspections and exhaust the remedies of the united nations and finish the diplomacy
6495790 if you were to talk colin powell today or then deputy secretary of state richard armitage theyll tell you they misled colin powell and through him the rest of us were given evidence that never would have passed scrutiny
6495791 i spent a lot of time trying to understand precisely what the extent of that evidence was
6495792 what has not been written about a lot is the due diligence that i did leading up to that vote i went to the united nations security council and i met with every single one of our security council ambassadors in a meeting i am the only senator i think that took the time to do that i spent two hours with them learning from them what their perceptions were from their countries about saddam husseins weaponry they agreed that iraq undoubtedly had weapons and that there needed to be some kind of inspection process put in place and they believed that they needed more time to put that in place ultimately we were going have to hold them accountable

6495864 the convention will be an opportunity to offer that clear contrast
6495865 i have seen war i have seen war on land and sea i have seen blood running from the wounded i have seen the dead in the mud i have seen cities destroyed i have seen children starving i have seen the agony of mothers and wives i hate war
6495866 we are advocates of the abolition of war we do not want war but war can only be abolished through war and in order to get rid of the gun it is necessary to take up the gun
6495867 it ought not to be an option for a young school leaver to get welfare benefits
6495868 young people should be presented with two options you either earn or learn welfare payments should not be an option for people under 21
6495869 the key fact here is that there were not inspections
6495870 you just cant lose sight of that if we had done the inspections we would have fought that fire in a very different way and we would not have run into these extremely difficult situations such as no water and blocked stairwells
6495871 all of the victims in this pattern that weve identified were 55 or older
6495872 so obviously he was preying on a universe of elderly people all of the victims in this pattern except one were women so obviously he was looking for the easiest prey for him he attacked many of them from behind so that many of them didnt see what happened
6495873 i dont have to speak im sure my smile is saying it all
6495874 besides giving birth to my children this is the happiest day of my life
6495875 the reports indicate that it was someone from the community who snitched and so for that we have to give them a hand clap
6495876 what we got to do is make sure that predators like this guy are off the street
6495877 make no mistake about it when hes arrested when hes prosecuted and convicted we will ask for consecutive penalties he will be a very very old guy before the time he ever gets out of prison
6495878 barack obamas ad is ridiculous because of john mccain corruption was exposed and people like jack abramoff went to jail
6495879 the question now is will barack obama immediately call on the university of illinois to release all of the records they are currently withholding to shed further light on senator obamas relationship with this unrepentant terrorist
6495880 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6495881 the reality is that barack obamas plans to raise taxes and opposition to producing more energy here at home as gas prices skyrocket show hes completely out of touch with the concerns of average americans
6495882 a well researched independent analysis of the data relating to terrorism
6495883 extraordinary drop in support for islamist terror organizations in the muslim world over the past five years
6495884 little else is requisite to carry a state to the highest degree of opulence from the lowest barbarism but peace easy taxes and a tolerable administration of justice all the rest being brought about by the natural course of things
6495885 they that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
6495886 any fool can criticize condemn and complain and most fools do
6495887 the state is that great fiction by which everyone tries to live at the expense of everyone else
6495888 when somebody persuades me that i am wrong i change my mind what do you do
6495889 whatever it is that government does sensible americans would prefer that the government do it to someone else this is the idea behind foreign policy
6495890 nothing astonishes men so much as common sense and plain dealing
6495891 never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity
6495892 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with inherent and inalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governme walt whitman
6495893 this initiative opens up possibilities for fraport as an airport operator and ground handling provider to apply its extensive know how actively and to help define standards within the framework of the cargo 2000 quality management system
6495894 think to yourself do i need it for a checking account do i need it for a savings account am i looking to take a mortgage a car loan
6495895 are there minimum balance fees for the kind of account that you want
6495896 if its a checking account are there checking account fees and does that change depending on the number of checks you write if you are planning to use atm machines and planning to make deposits or withdrawals in atm machines are there fees that are charged
6495897 those fees can range anywhere from 30 to 40 and overdraft protection is often included as a courtesy but is a feature of the account a consumer needs to affirmatively opt out of
6495898 overdraft fees in the united states total billions of dollars so thats something consumers have to be aware of is that a feature that they think would be an advantage or a disadvantage
6495899 well if you notice the reflection of the clock in the mirror this is actually a household screen there are in fact two separate pieces so it appears to be the reflection of the clock
6495900 theres a wooden structure on top these are pool noodles theres an extra bit of foam and then its covered with paper mach
6495901 we go from medieval all the way up to contemporary but most of our stuff is probably elizabethan so theres every fabric imaginable
6495902 i mean they use fabrics that you dont think they would use theres cotton on our stage as well i mean its not only the big brocades that you associate with that period
6495903 our job isnt to subsidize every business model including ones that may not be working
6495904 satellite radio for example charging a subscription makes about 118 per year per consumer over the air radio they generate about 80 per year per consumer pandora by their own testimony last year at a hearing its generating about 1 70 per listener per year there are no ads how are they generating money
6495905 it is their fault but on the flip side the reason why its their fault theyre not making as much as terrestrial radio
6495906 theyre not buying into the sleaze that terrestrial radio does and its very much the same kind of problem that an independent band faces when it needs to either do something that would potentially involve selling out or not being able to make music anymore
6495907 you have to take into account the audience size and you have to take into account customizability
6495908 and you have to take into account that you can almost create radio stations on the fly none of those things have been taken into account
6495909 music art dance theater i think there is this ongoing marriage between the arts
6495910 in terms of what we get from it its a feeling its a mood and we can see shapes forms color not only through music but also through art
6495911 there is a significant acs history in that household so detectives are conducting the investigation
6495912 there are three children in that household obviously the two and a half year old a one year old and a five year old
6495913 my sympathies are with the case workers and the judges who have to make those decisions every single day
6495914 and sometimes they turn out to be in retrospect i dont know if they made the wrong decision but in this case a tragedy took place and our prayers should be with a two year old who is dead
6495915 that kid is only two years old he dont have a life yet come on he cant even fight
6495916 he didnt have a chance what kind of chance did that little boy have at two years old
6495917 i have eight children of my own and i cant even imagine coming home to something like that
6495918 ninety percent of the cars are going past the speed limit
6495919 our main goal is to actually get a car free park and i believe we can do it
6495920 its really outrageous that children have to worry about crossing the street in a park because of cars coming
6495921 given all the pedestrian traffic we have in the park all the seniors all the children all the people jogging and on bicycles we cannot have cars driving 40 miles an hour in prospect park
6495922 its just a ticking time bomb really waiting for some serious injury or fatality
6495923 the park is not for you know cars the park was made for people to have fun and relax
6495924 i recycle i have mostly cfls but what the one thing im missing that could really make an impact and thats easy and thats not very expensive
6495925 litalia dei talenti soffocati e che vorrebbero emergere quella delle intelligenze costrette a emigrare quella di chi vorrebbe colorare il futuro e ha davanti solo grigio e mediocrit quella di chi vorrebbe riconoscere i suoi nuovi vicini ma ha paura e avverte insicurezza
6495926 difetto di certa sinistra considerare poco importanti i problemi che la maggior parte delle persone ritiene fondamentali

6495930 muslims are generally barbaric but as long as you stay in your own land they wont harm you
6495931 i was the last tourist at star trek the experience
6495932 with educated people i suppose punctuation is a matter of rule with me it is a matter of feeling but i must say i have a great respect for the semi colon its a very useful little chap
6495933 on thursday of last week two ladies from tennessee came before the president asking the release of their husbands held as prisoners of war at johnsons island
6495934 you say your husband is a religious man tell him when you meet him that i say i am not much of a judge of religion but that in my opinion the religion that sets men to rebel against their government because as they think that government does not sufficiently help some men to eat their bread on the sweat of other mens faces is not the sort of religion on which people can get to heaven
6495935 el ndice de tendencia futura apunta a un lento crecimiento durante el resto del a o y posiblemente a una econom a que se para

6495937 it will definitely change the weekend for me because its a tragedy
6495938 all the spanish people are in shock and i am too its probably the saddest approach to a weekend i have had
6495939 i will wear a black armband and i will talk with the other drivers tomorrow

6495956 rescue groups are springing up to fill the deficit in animal welfare services
6495957 animal control is overwhelmed and as more people experience economic hardship more will be viewing pets as unnecessary expenses

6495963 yeah ive been watching me fall for what seems like years watching me grow small i watch me disappear slipping out my ordinary world
6495964 she pulled him down for hours deeper than ive ever been and as i fall in the mirror on the wall im watching me scream

6495968 we at the green bay packers today were saddened to learn of the passing of gene upshaw
6495969 gene was a hall of fame player who very much appreciated the game and all its traditions and history through his leadership on behalf of the players he helped to strengthen the game and grow the popularity and success it enjoys today
6495970 personally i owe a lot to gene i had the chance to work with him first as a player representative and then he gave me a start with the players association as an assistant executive director in 1985 after my playing career had ended
6495971 i was impressed that he always had the best interests of the game in the forefront even though he remained a strong advocate for the players at the end of the day he always wanted to do what was right for the game
6495972 he treated the players with dignity and they had great respect for him given his stature as a hall of famer and all of his accomplishments in more than 40 years of nfl involvement
6495973 fundamentally change how we talk about imagine and experience the internet

6496062 iraqi foreign minister hoshyar zebari said thursday that iraq and the united states have reached preliminary agreement on a pact to govern the future use of u s forces in the war torn country and said the draft will be shown to top iraqi leaders friday
6496063 we have a text zebari said after several hours of meetings between secretary of state condoleezza rice iraqi prime minister nouri al maliki and others there is no final agreement but we are very close everything has been addressed tomorrow is a very important day
6496064 neither rice nor zebari would offer specifics of the draft agreement at a post meeting news conference
6496065 all the issues have been addressed mr zebari said he declined to answer questions on how the draft addressed the issue of immunity for american troops from iraqi prosecution or the timing of any withdrawal of combat soldiers
6496066 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement rice told reporters after meeting with iraqi officials including prime minister nouri al maliki

6496154 today the assembly passed a win win for both the disability community and the business community
6496155 the creation of the disability commission and the reforms to the current lawsuit practices spell the end of decade long debates and problems now we can get down to the issue of ensuring that california is a state dedicated to accessibility for all its citizens we applaud the actions of our legislators on this critical issue
6496156 this measure takes a balanced approach to promote compliance with both state and federal access laws and i am proud to be a principal coauthor of this legislation
6496157 although efforts have been made to improve access for people with disabilities over the last several decades significant gaps continue to persist as a result of ongoing meetings and discussion with all interested parties over the past two years sb 1608 is a bipartisan comprehensive reform measure that will help business owners ensure that their premises are fully accessible to all californians by being in compliance with state and federal laws on disability access
6496158 this expedited process will help to lower the cost of attorneys fees for businesses who have utilized a casp certified inspector without affecting the right of people with disabilities to obtain damages for a violation
6496159 i have been working on ada issues since my first term in the legislature meeting in my district with groups like the vacaville chamber of commerce which has worked for years to ensure ada compliance through education and training for both the local business community and city building inspectors
6496160 i am pleased that we are finally making significant progress on what has been a very contentious issue
6496161 i have been urging the division of the state architect to expedite submission of california s regulations in order to conform with federal law for more than 4 years the fact that california has not conformed its laws with the federal ada is another reason why businesses find it difficult to be in compliance congress enacted the ada in 1990 it is time to bring california s regulations into compliance with federal law
6496162 it was a positive discussion and we will now move forward together
6496163 i can confirm that we had a friendly and positive meeting and were moving forward

6496174 we are ready to deliver weapons of a defensive character that do not violate the strategic balance of power in the region
6496175 we are trying to balance the right to have a handgun for use of self defense in the home with protecting our citizens
6496176 a handgun for use of self defense in the home
6496177 anti gun politicians can no longer deny that the second amendment guarantees a fundamental right
6496178 our campaign to enact sensible gun laws will be undiminished by the supreme courts decision in the heller case
6496179 is far from a victory for gun owners it is already being used successfully to infringe upon the rights of gun owners across the country
6496180 ban on handgun possession in the home violates the second amendment as does its prohibition against rendering any lawful firearm in the home operable for the purpose of immediate self defense
6496181 rendering any lawful firearm in the home operable for the purpose of self defense
6496182 the right of the people to keep and bear arms
6496183 the right of the people to keep and bear arms
6496184 a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed
6496185 it would mean that the national firearms acts restrictions on machineguns might be unconstitutional
6496186 if weapons that are most useful in military service m 16 rifles and the like may be banned then the second amendment right is completely detached from the militia clause but the conception of the militia at the time of the second amendments ratification was the body of all citizens capable of military service who would bring the sorts of lawful weapons that they possessed at home to militia duty it may well be true today that a militia to be as effective as militias in the 18th century would require sophisticated arms that are highly unusual in society at large but the fact that modern developments have limited the degree of fit between the militia clause and the protected right cannot change our interpretation of the right
6496187 to be as effective as militias in the 18th century
6496188 the right secured by the second amendment is not unlimited
6496189 nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms
6496190 we identify these presumptively lawful regulatory measures only as examples our list does not purport to be exhaustive
6496191 the right of the people to keep and bear arms
6496192 declining to establish a level of scrutiny for evaluating second amendment restrictions
6496193 the right of law abiding responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home

6496316 i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6496317 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6496318 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6496319 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues

6496362 it looks pretty nice its very wide and the surface looks very smooth it looks pretty fun so we will see tomorrow it looks nice when you walk it but it is a different story when you go 300km h around it but i expect to have good fun when we drive around
6496363 it takes a few laps when you know where to go but you learn and learn all the time small things and small lines but i would not say it is too hard
6496364 there are a few bumps because i guess they need to turn the bridge sometimes that is the only place where i found any bumps on the circuit and one of them is in the middle of the corner so that might affect things a bit but apart from that the circuit looks very smooth and very well done we will see tomorrow how good it is in the end but i expect to have quite good fun
6496365 definitely we would rather have won more races we had some chances but in the end we couldnt win them but we are still in a good position for the championship although the season could have been much better it could also have been much worse
6496366 overall i am happy where we are right now lately the races have not been exactly what i was expecting so hopefully we will get some good races now and get back where we should be the biggest issue is getting stuck behind people after having a bad qualifying so if we can sort out that then we should be fine we just need to work on some things and hopefully we will get back to winning some races
6496367 there are some circuits coming that i enjoy hopefully we can get things sorted out so that we can really fight for wins we have the good speed as long as we can use it in qualifying in the race we should be fine
6496368 i dont really worry about anything there are many races to go it is easy to lose points but also easy to win we will try to do the best every weekend and hopefully after a few races we are still in a good position and then we can try and win the championship
6496369 more or less there is pressure every race so it doesnt really change anything when it gets later in the season when you have the chance to win the championship it is more crucial not to make any mistakes but that is normal all the time like i said we will do the best we can every race and then see where we end up
6496370 we will try at least at the last race i ran off the circuit as the handling was not what we expected i just ran wide it is always easy to say that i have fixed this or that but we should be fine
6496371 we know when we get everything as we want that we have the speed but it hasnt been easy it is a similar situation to last year so its not the first time to be in this position hopefully we can fix it now and have better qualifying and better races after that
6496372 every race is crucial its not just monaco the last race if you look you could not get past anybody if they did not make a mistake so it is the same here the circuit is very wide and there are some long straights so here there are some better overtaking chances than in hungary
6496373 but still if you are not in front then you are going to lose many seconds stuck behind people even if you get past them in the end it is always crucial to be at the front
6496374 there is no one issue sometimes it goes right sometimes not at the last race i ran off the circuit which doesnt help but like i said we havent been exactly happy with the handling and it easily makes it look worse than it is
6496375 the problem is that it is very close between everybody now and if you are one tenth slower you lose three places we would have fixed it if we knew what to do but i think we will find a solution we just need to put more effort in and try to get it right
6496376 q do you think the summer break was a help for you allowing you to recharge a bit
6496377 i really dont know we will see tomorrow and over the weekend but i enjoyed it i had a good time we havent had good races lately for many different reasons but we know we have the speed if we get things right so im not too worried about it the main thing like i said before is the qualifying after that we have good speed when we get it right
6496378 i was mainly home just doing different stuff seeing my friends and family and just enjoying it
6496379 well what can i say i havent been fast enough that is the first point without going off in the last qualifying we could easily have been in third place so it is the small things that when it goes wrong you lose a lot of time and it looks much worse than it is
6496380 it can be just a small issue and it makes you go off the circuit and run wide and you lose a lot of time since we changed to these tyres even last year i wasnt exactly happy in qualifying even though in race conditions we are much happier with the car
6496381 it is not a new issue sometimes we get it right and sometimes we dont
6496382 but we are still looking for it and it depends a lot on the circuits at some circuits it is easier to get it right at some its very difficult hopefully we have found some halfway solution where we are fast but can still be happy with
6496383 we are experiencing a tremendous amount of interest among companies in the food and consumer goods industries that are interested in participating in the global open innovation marketplace
6496384 whether it is looking for ways to make chocolate less fattening or identifying salt replacement technologies in food without impacting flavor companies are looking for innovative ideas that will help them bring healthy products to market faster
6496385 with a special focus on the creation of functional and medicinal foods with new properties
6496386 ninesigma provides a great opportunity for the functional foods center and our members to leverage open innovation and current functional food research and development to solve real world problems
6496387 our members consist of scientists and functional food experts whose primary focus is on working with other experts and organizations to use functional foods to help diminish disease promote health and reduce health care costs
6496388 so as far as leadership and patriotism goes i think its really important that those things have to take place and i think hes barack obama the best democratic candidate weve had since bill clinton and thats coming from a democrat
6496389 i thought the question was how many spouses ive had

6496417 the magnetic field on the surface of the gold nanoparticles can be enhanced by up to hundred times which breaks apart the pollutant molecules in the air
6496418 this technology is solar powered and is very energy efficient because only the particles of gold heat up
6496419 in conventional chemical reactions you heat up everything which is a waste of energy
6496420 once this technology can be applied to produce specialty chemicals at ambient temperature it heralds significant changes in the economy and environmental impact of the chemical production

6496447 we can no longer take our extensive water supplies for granted
6496448 canada lacks sound information at a national scale on the major uses and user s of water
6496449 national forecasting of water availability has never been done because traditionally our use of the resource was thought to be unlimited
6496450 our lack of data places canada at strategic disadvantage for bilateral negotiations with the u s
6496451 this report is a one stop shop document that can guide us toward ensuring that we get clean safe water to canadians wherever they choose to live
6496452 the fact that theyre even taking this close a look at this issue is good news in my mind because theyve been away from the fresh water scene for so long

6496492 the conversations that were having with the iraqis now are based on the improvement in security and our mutual desire to bring more american troops home
6496493 the president and every american wants to see american troops come home but not until the job is done and there is more security more political progress and more economic progress inside iraq
6496494 the conventions provide a big national spotlight for both candidates a chance to have the stage when voters are actually paying attention
6496495 it is an incredible opportunity to tell the american people your vision for the country and what you will do as president and that can change the dynamics of the race
6496496 they are finished with just telling voters about themselves now they have to show voters they are ready to be president
6496497 there is definitely going to be a contrast drawn between the two candidates
6496498 this convention will make the choice crystal clear between two very different approaches to leadership
6496499 the real open question is what is he going to do he has to take that question head on in this convention and make it clear in an unequivocal way what the two or three priorities for his candidacy are
6496500 i dont think americans have a clear sense of what his plan for the american economy is that is something they can fix at the convention and they need to do that
6496501 obama is cotton candy it tastes great but you cant live on it mccain is meat and potatoes
6496502 the convention will be an opportunity to offer that clear contrast
6496503 if mccain wants to distance himself from the bush era i dont think the convention will do that its going to undo some of the good work he has done in the last month

6496507 these cases resulted primarily from failure to vaccinate many because of philosophical or religious belief
6496508 this is the lowest percentage of imported measles cases since 1996
6496509 in the decade before the measles vaccination program began an estimated 3 to 4 million persons in the united states were infected each year of these 400 to 500 died 48 000 were hospitalized and another 1 000 developed chronic disability from measles encephalitis
6496510 of the 95 patients eligible for vaccination 63 were unvaccinated because of their or their parents philosophical or religious beliefs
6496511 increases in the proportion of the population declining vaccination for themselves or their children might lead to large scale outbreaks in the united states
6496512 measles knows no borders but can be prevented for less than one dollar per child in a developing country we must be steadfast in our efforts to reduce measles cases globally
6496513 hes a humble guy but i know its my job to get the guy the baton and i didnt do that
6496514 will be the way we select train and coach our relays
6496515 if people want to assess the blame to me thats ok
6496516 i mean i can take whatever it is that people are going to dish out we had good chemistry the hand was back there she was there i dont know what happened
6496517 i was talking to myself tuesday and thinking about the steep fine and how much it was but the league has to do what it has to do in order to keep the nfl in the right direction it sounds steep and me personally i dont have anything on my record anymore but its the personal conduct policy and you have to abide by it
6496518 most of the actions were fights broken jaws stuff like that
6496519 mine was kind of just disorderly conduct which it was i guess that falls under the personal conduct that fights over theres no winning that battle i go with the rules they set now i get to play monday night pockets are a little lighter but i still get to play
6496520 it was definitely an experience that i dont want to experience again
6496521 id rather go on a more positive note ill tell you that
6496522 but thats the way the league assesses things i was surprised initially that they wanted to suspend nick for such a minor offense im still surprised at the substantial fine but im pleased the suspension was lifted
6496523 i was just trying to get away from it and move on and play football it still ended with the same result i didnt get any charges or anything like that but if i would have fought it and it came back not guilty im sure it wouldve been a different disciplinary action from the nfl
6496524 few people in the history of the national football league have played the game as well as gene and then had another career in football with so much positive impact on the structure and competitiveness of the entire league as gene
6496525 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6496526 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6496527 it is a very very sad day he was a leader without peers and a dear friend who i will never forget
6496528 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6496529 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children i didnt know gene personally i just knew him professionally
6496530 im not going to sell the players on a cap again
6496531 once we go through the cap why should we agree to it again
6496532 gene and i developed a close friendship that remained strong through the good times and some of the nfls most difficult challenges
6496533 we worked very closely on key issues that allowed the nfl to maintain unprecedented labor peace his biggest asset was his understanding of the business of the game and you always knew that his concern for the games best interests guided his actions
6496534 gene was a true pioneer as one of the few african american leaders of a major union
6496535 he was the equal of owners in negotiations and made the league a better place for all players playing alongside of gene was an honor and a privilege he was a pillar of strength and leadership for our great raider teams

6496613 based upon authenticated handling of json data exchanges between the self contained javascript client apps and apples cloud rather than the ssl web page encryption used by https
6496614 when you set up your mobileme email account it defaults to a secure connection and in testing ical i found both the push and manual synchronization process appears to use ssl

6496634 there is no industry wireless phone standard and because of their marketing power the carriers have little incentive to make sure devices deliver on promises

6496876 but i know that you want to see the cave dont you ill show you
6496877 its odd standing here in the same area where my ancestors were buried i felt really strange when i had the bones the skull of my great great great grandfather dating back 120 generations in my hands
6496878 i cant describe it the hairs on the back of my neck stood on end it wasnt exactly a nice feeling but it was an incredible experience that i wont ever forget the 3 000 year old bones are so far removed from our lives today and these 120 generations thats so long ago
6496879 we have no idea what happened during this time we dont know what happened to these people
6496880 it is a unique discovery while we were examining the prehistoric bones of the male individuals we found genetic patterns which are unique
6496881 we wanted to find out whether these genetic patterns were still present in the living population of this area so we put an advert in the local paper and we asked people to take part in our project 270 people came forward we were very surprised that so many wanted to help us
6496882 the local residents had to give a sample of saliva we extracted dna from the saliva and looked for the genetic patterns on the y chromosome in the end we found two men who have a very similar genetic pattern to the prehistoric one and that genetic pattern is unique
6496883 i saw the advert in the paper and i thought it was an interesting idea
6496884 they took a sample of saliva using cotton wool buds they put it in a plastic tube and then sealed it the scientists also had their mouths covered to prevent any mixing of the dna samples
6496885 i didnt expect it at all to end up being the direct descendant of the cavemen its amazing especially as on that particular day i had such a dry mouth i thought the dna sample wouldnt work
6496886 your appearance is determined by both parents by the mother and father we were investigating the y chromosome from father to son in our project its a modern phenomenon that we move around in the old days people normally lived and stayed in the same place where they were born
6496887 i definitely think the shape of the head is similar to the caveman but after 3 000 years and 120 generations im sure personalities have changed
6496888 i dont think they the public did have enough time to get to know the candidates

6496933 seasonal products are often over packaged and so require extra focus to minimise the packaging used as well as communicating to consumers they can recycle the packaging used
6496934 these initiatives are part of a long term sustainability programme looking at how to reduce the amount of packaging we use whilst still protecting the product and satisfying consumer needs for a gifting proposition
6496935 all nestle confectionerys selection boxes are now made from recycled board and the plastic trays are made from recycled bottles
6496936 in total there will be 231 tonnes less packaging in 2008 and there will also be on pack messages to encourage kids to recycle
6496937 major players in the seasonal confectionery industry have signed up to this group
6496938 by joining they are ensuring that issues relating to packaging are taken into account and that consumer appeal is retained

6497027 the inspection panel has clearly laid out the reckless manner in which wapco disrupted the lives and livelihoods of villagers in nigeria
6497028 we take satisfaction in the fact that the panel validated our claims and that the banks management accepted responsibility for allowing wapco to trample peoples rights but we still dont have an explanation on why such grievous violations of world bank policy were allowed to occur
6497029 the world bank should explain why it failed to effectively present the case for land for land compensation that bank policy calls for and should prove its claim that now after the mistakes are acknowledged there is no more land available for the displaced people even after reading the banks version of events it is hard to believe the bank did not collude with wapco to slash the already very conservative valuation of the villagers property
6497030 lets remember that wapco is not a struggling local enterprise but a consortium of some of the worlds richest companies including chevron and shell it is stunning to see them and the world bank deny impoverished people their due
6497031 the world bank quoted us the prices we should be paid and then reneged without consulting us they have sown confusion and despair in my community now that they are admitting mistakes they must publicly disclose how they decided on their valuations of our trees crops and lands

6497038 few people in the history of the national football league have played the game as well as gene and then had another career in football with so much positive impact on the structure and competitiveness of the entire league as gene
6497039 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6497040 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6497041 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6497042 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children i didnt know gene personally i just knew him professionally
6497043 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so
6497044 he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
6497045 im not going to sell the players on a cap again
6497046 once we go through the cap why should we agree to it again
6497047 gene and i developed a close friendship that remained strong through the good times and some of the nfls most difficult challenges
6497048 we worked very closely on key issues that allowed the nfl to maintain unprecedented labor peace his biggest asset was his understanding of the business of the game and you always knew that his concern for the games best interests guided his actions
6497049 tony and i both laughed at that we got a chuckle out of it

6497062 endogenous retroviruses provide yet another example of molecular sequence evidence for universal common descent
6497063 if on the other hand organisms are designed we expect dna as much as possible to exhibit function
6497064 endogenous retrovirus erv elements have been shown to contribute promoter sequences that can initiate transcription of adjacent human genes however the extent to which retroviral sequences initiate transcription within the human genome is currently unknown

6497083 we understand the russian stance and the russian military response as a result of the provocations which took place we appreciate the courageous decision taken by the russian leadership in responding to the international initiatives and the start of withdrawing its forces
6497084 russia has always been a sponsor to this process well discuss the active role which russia can play in this regard
6497085 we can discuss all the issues of interest for the syrian russian dialogue which is developing well and in a dynamic way

6497087 everything from noise to hardcore techno to acoustic to ambient electronic and thats only what i recall right now
6497088 during this conversation mr wood stated as he has several times in the past that he has no idea why he is being executed

6497090 for centuries people appreciated only the beautiful works of art and long life of the colours but little did they realise that these works of art are also in modern language photocatalytic air purifier with nanostructured gold catalyst
6497091 these vocs create that new smell as they are slowly released from walls and furniture but they along with methanol and carbon monoxide are not good for your health even in small amounts
6497092 gold when in very small particles becomes very active under sunlight
6497093 the electromagnetic field of the sunlight can couple with the oscillations of the electrons in the gold particles and creates a resonance
6497094 the magnetic field on the surface of the gold nanoparticles can be enhanced by up to hundred times which breaks apart the pollutant molecules in the air
6497095 this technology is solar powered and is very energy efficient because only the particles of gold heat up
6497096 in conventional chemical reactions you heat up everything which is a waste of energy
6497097 once this technology can be applied to produce specialty chemicals at ambient temperature it heralds significant changes in the economy and environmental impact of the chemical production

6497115 hoy cuando hace poco el presidente nos entreg a los venezolanos un paquete de 26 leyes no hay sorpresa alguna son leyes cortadas con la misma tijera que se cort la reforma constitucional todo estaba hecho a conciencia porque es imperdonable que el articulado de las leyes vaya en sentido de la reforma
6497116 en ese caramelo dulce viene la clasificaci n o la confiscaci n del pueblo conquistados en la descentralizaci n se eliminan los institutos de viviendas regionales las competencias de los gobiernos regionales
6497117 de esta forma se centraliza en manos del ejecutivo toda competencia de la conducci n desarrollo y construcci n de planes habitacionales del pa s tambi n el presidente es el nico que tiene la potestad de decidir el modelo de vivienda
6497118 hasta donde llegar la voracidad de este gobierno de sacarle de los bolsillos el dinero de los pobres por qu seguir subsidiando construcciones en el exterior a costa de nosotros
6497119 una sociedad sin poder nunca ser democr tica todo el poder que se ha restado al pueblo ahora lo tiene el presidente por esas leyes en las 26 normas se menciona 32 veces la palabra pueblo y 382 veces la palabra ejecutivo nacional
6497120 pareciera que se les estuviera diciendo al mundo que no hay suficiente cemento para las viviendas que se est n construyendo aqu cuando la verdad es que este gobierno ha construido menos viviendas que cualquier otro en 50 a os
6497121 y se hace evidente la mora del gobierno no es s lo ser rico sino que ahora ganarse el pan con el trabajo propio tambi n es malo
6497122 nosotros no promovemos el individualismo estamos de acuerdo con que los intereses de la sociedad est n por encima de la de los individuos pero nuestra preocupaci n es si el excedente se reinvierte en necesidades de la sociedades c mo se reproduce entonces en el sistema de econom a popular si no hay distribuci n justa y acumulaci n de capital colectivo no habr a crecimiento y desarrollo el sistema que no acumule capital est condenado a la muerte pero al presidente no parece importarle esto
6497123 el presidente pretende que la inversi n necesaria para que se produzca la econom a popular venga del gobierno esa visi n de una fuerza par sita del gobierno es la misma que estuvimos viendo por muchos a os en el pa s
6497124 nos consta que dentro del gobierno se conocen estas cosas lo escrito en estas leyes est hecho a conciencia detr s de esto lo que se perfila es un capitalismo de estado esto est bien lejos de ser un socialismo moderno como se ve en otros pa ses donde la democracia y el respeto de las instituciones est por encima de cualquier cosa
6497125 nuestra constituci n es tajante al se alar qui n tiene el poder y ah se establece que es el pueblo el soberano es el derecho hasta qu punto la naci n venezolana es la que define y desarrolla las pol ticas agraria en el pa s

6497151 do you there are things i believe which should not in my position at least be shared with the public at large for everybodys consumption because that would look like self advertising or a political striptease
6497152 indeed russia and the u s were allies during the two tragic conflicts of the second and the first world wars which allows us to think theres something objectively bringing us together in difficult times and i think i believe it has to do with geopolitical interests and also has a moral component the ability to compromise is not a diplomatic politeness toward a partner but rather taking into account and respecting your partners legitimate interests
6497153 we were thinking about each others interests and at the same time about the interests of the country in question the problems the issues we were trying to address based on such an approach in the end we resolved the issue to a large extent at the same time where we fail to be guided by those basic principles where we push forward some economic or political self interest we fail to arrive at solutions that would realistically address the issue where we try to take into account each others interest we achieve lasting results
6497154 the bloc system of relations must be replaced by an altogether different system based on common rules that are called international law and those rules should be strictly abided by at the end of the day only this may ensure stability and respect for the interest of small nations and not just large ones and superpowers like the united states
6497155 la democracia es comprender que las decisiones publicas afectan a mucha gente y que de lo que se trata es que beneficien a la mayor a y no a una sola persona o a la minor a por eso la manera como se han decretado estas leyes muchas de ellas con un impacto muy hondo en el plano econ mico en la manera de producir en la manera de defender el patrimonio de la gente en la manera como se establece el sistema de propiedad la manera como se han decretado estas leyes es arbitraria
6497156 estas leyes son un abuso y esta congregaci n que podemos hace de parte de su dirigencia calificada es una demostraci n del descontento que existe

6497192 for nearly 25 years the industry has struggled on under an ever increasing burden while governments have taken the money without thinking too much about the impact on businesses paying the tax
6497193 the strange thing about compliance costs is that governments are continually seeking to reduce them but it is governments who generate them in the first place
6497194 governments face demands to reduce and demands to create compliance costs

6497198 i rate crocky as one of the most destructive looseheads in the country and if i can match him up at training then what better benchmark
6497199 thats one of the good things about working alongside crocky and c j theyre more than happy to put down a few three on threes and teach me loosehead
6497200 its important to be able to play both and crusaders and tasman prop ben franks is a good example of that during the super 14 he was able to come in and play both sides at the drop of a hat

6497202 theres some old heads around the comp and you chew each others ear off a bit and then laugh about it after the game

6497204 it works both ways and if the scrum is no good theyll let us know about it
6497205 theres so much interest in them and whats happening now is people end up paying top price for them anyway
6497206 probably the reverse is now true and they see it as a marketing tactic and it may actually not be a mortgagee property at all
6497207 real estate agents will pick up on anything to get a sale and if they think more and more people are after mortgagee sales theyll call it anything to get a sale theyll use any tactic
6497208 it makes me a wee bit suspicious when theyre passed in are they genuine mortgagee sales
6497209 there could well be the perception that you will get a bargain its not necessarily the case
6497210 i think that would be a very dangerous way to advertise things expectations would be altered

6497212 motorists should pay more to drive cars including more expensive car parks and fees to use the roads if new zealand is to survive rising oil prices a comprehensive new report says the increased costs would be coupled with investment in public transport tax breaks for fuel efficient vehicles laws requiring new developments to provide showers and lockers for walkers and bikers improved urban design and encouraging businesses to swap company cars for cash or bus subsidies the independent report managing transport challenges when oil prices rise was commissioned by the governments new zealand transport agency as a response to rising petrol prices petrol peaked at 2 19 a litre in july for 91 octane and has since fallen but the report by transport consultants from mccormick rankin cagney and academics says high oil prices are a serious and urgent risk and predicts petrol will rise to 2 80 by 2014 new zealanders would be particularly stung by rising prices because of their over reliance on cars currently 80 per cent of the population travel by private car and only 4 per cent by bus fourteen per cent is commercial the report calls for a fundamental shift in the governments transport solutions away from building more roads toward investing in alternative transport and maintaining existing roads
6497213 riot police had to control fights among a crowd of almost 200 people as they tried to arrest a suspected thief wielding nunchaku in wellingtons manners mall
6497214 he looked like he knew what he was doing with them
6497215 they just beat up anyone who looks at them the wrong way
6497216 the police were too scared to go in there they kept going up to the door and then hed start swinging again
6497217 there would be taranaki away taranaki at home taranaki off and taranaki on and a taranaki on is a bloody hard team to beat and thats usually what every team is like when they play a canterbury side
6497218 if they can beat canterbury theyll be happy and we wouldnt want it any other way we set ourselves a really high standard and try to get to it each week and if a team wants to try and bring us down thats a real motivating factor for us
6497219 im actually really happy with the way were tracking at the moment our gain line in the sense of getting past the advantage line on first and second phase has been really high and it helps when youve got strong runners like centre adam whitelock
6497220 im feeling pretty good myself and when youve got guys around you who are playing well its pretty easy to play well yourself im enjoying the role ive got in the team at the moment playing at 12 and the style were playing under pens rob penney and hags john haggart
6497221 the boys are starting to gel a bit more now and i think that if we can bring the attitude we brought against auckland every week well be pretty hard to beat
6497222 its really hard to know if youve brought it until the night we can prepare really well all week which we have this week and still not perform that well in the weekend

6497231 global demand for all types of energy has risen steeply and supplies of finite resources like oil and gas are under intense pressure
6497232 the world is experiencing an energy shock of a kind not seen since the early 1970s but which is likely to have more profound and lasting consequences this is what lies behind much of the dramatic increase in wholesale energy prices we have experienced

6497260 i guess if you think that being rich means you got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then it is not surprising that you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6497261 but if you are like me and you got one house or you were like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6497262 im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
6497263 when i bought the first one my husband who is not a beach person said oh this is such a waste of money the kids will never go
6497264 then it got to the point where they used it so much i couldnt get in the place so i bought another one

6497271 java has always been a first class citizen but even with the power of web 2 0 javascript has always been a second class language and ides have always treated it as a second class language
6497272 in java you have content assist you can write any java file in the editor and you get first class support all the way javascript is more like a text editor what makes ganymede a really brand new and possibly game changing event is that for the first time javascript is a part of the jdt its now becoming a first class language inside of eclipse
6497273 maven is a very broad and capable tool set but thats a politically correct way of saying its all over the place our users are just trying to get things done they have a specific type of project theyre trying to complete so we tailored maven to work with our existing project structure
6497274 maven is an extremely difficult thing to learn in the first couple of days the reason is there are some legal restrictions that make it tough to bring in certain jars its like welcome to maven now jump through these hoops if you succeed maybe tomorrow youll be able to do a build when you install myeclipse and maven it takes care of a number of difficult steps that most developers had done by hand for years
6497275 a war in czechoslovakia together they tuned into radio prague on a little transition radio fisher says and they heard that czechoslovakia was
6497276 we have to take care of all czechs and slovaks who are trapped in our country
6497277 very much afraid of czechoslovakias eventually leaving the warsaw pact
6497278 russian tanks can appear in any east european city tomorrow
6497279 the degree to which islamist extremists around the world have dropped their previous obsession with iraq and now focus on the afghan pakistan area has been astounding
6497280 no one recruiting for or seeking to join jihadist fighting in europe are trying to get to iraq its all afghanistan now
6497281 no one raising money for jihad is directing funds to iraq either the afghan pakistan region has regained the power of attraction it had prior to september 11
6497282 it was the original jihad against occupying infidels and it was long al qaedas terror sanctuary bin laden still lurks there somewhere
6497283 afghanistan isnt just about killing americans but fighting the assembled forces of the world they accuse of attacking islam
6497284 beyond the immediate human reaction to this loss of life this attack is most instructive in telling us about the rapidly rising strength and capacity of the people were up against
6497285 the taliban have been allowed to reconstitute and re arm themselves to levels nearing those prior to the invasion
6497286 to halt international military cooperation events between russia and nato countries until further instructions
6497287 our hearts are breaking with whats happening with baby colin
6497288 there has been a deterioration in the whales condition over the last couple of hours weve decided it is in the best interests of the whale that it is put down
6497289 conducting a pre planned routine visit to the black sea region to interact and exercise with our nato partners romania and bulgaria which is an important feature of our routine planning
6497290 we strongly urge the u n and the international community to take serious action to stop this menace
6497291 if nothing is done more ships may be hijacked and there will be serious consequences on this important shipping route
6497292 this breakdown of the peace process is not caused by the milf we have been very consistent we have been very observing the cease fire but in spite of all of this the government does not honor its commitments
6497293 its in tatters its in tatters i dont know how to pick up the pieces
6497294 i think things look really grim at the moment i think theres a good chance that it will be a while and i mean years before we can get back to where we were before the court order stopped the agreement from being implemented
6497295 but i think as well there are real questions about whether either party negotiating the agreement did enough work with its own constituents
6497296 theres been some fairly bellicose statements coming out of the armed forces
6497297 i think probably both sides would prefer not to have to go back to conflict but what was holding hostilities back was the prospect that peace was at least if not around the corner on the horizon and now its a big question mark
6497298 brown and billy king brought together a team nobody knew that nobody expected a lot of
6497299 we built ourselves into a championship team unfortunately i got the wrist injury coach made the move to bring dikembe in it was a business move that had to be done had to be done right then in order for them to get to the finals of course i was disappointed i constantly hear it anytime i see somebody from philly
6497300 wed have been a much stronger team going into the finals any time you take a big piece away from a team it was a domino effect the whole dynamics of the team changed
6497301 working with the wetlands institute and building the excluder traps to help protect the diamondbacks has been a significant part of our audubon certification process

6497303 capsaicin is classified as a doping prohibited substance given its hypersensitising properties and as a medication class a prohibited substance for its pain relieving properties
6497304 somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have
6497305 if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6497306 but if youre like me and you got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home then you might have a different perspective
6497307 and by the way the answer is john mccain has seven homes
6497308 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6497309 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6497310 lol they expect to us vote for that empty suit obama because mccain has seven houses this that it lol
6497311 just like in the biblical days of moses when the people wanted a golden calf to worship when they had the real thing in moses
6497312 no john mccain was a pow with me the reason is i was there for 8 years and john got there 2 years later so he was a pow for 5 years and we have our own seniority system based on time as a pow
6497313 returned with honor thats our pow motto but since many of you keep asking what i think of him ive decided to write it out in short i think john sidney mccain iii is a good man but not someone i will vote for in the upcoming election to be our president of the united states
6497314 it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven
6497315 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6497316 i didnt decide to run for president to start a national crusade for the political reforms i believed in or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism in truth i wanted to be president because it had become my ambition to be president in truth id had the ambition for a long time
6497317 never done any favors for anybody lobbyist or special interest group thats a clear 24 year record
6497318 it all started in march 1987 charles h keating jr the flamboyant developer and anti porn crusader needed help the government was poised to seize lincoln savings and loan a freewheeling subsidiary of keatings american continental corp as federal auditors crawled all over lincoln keating was not content to wait and hope for the best hed spread a lot of money around washington and it was time to call in his chits one of his first stops was sen dennis deconcini the arizona lawmaker was one of keatings most loyal friends in congress and for good reason keating had given thousands of dollars to deconcinis campaigns at one point deconcini even pushed keating for ambassador to the bahamas where keating owned a luxurious vacation home now keating had a job for deconcini he wanted him to organize a meeting with the regulators the message get off lincolns back eventually deconcini would set up a meeting between five senators and the regulators one of them was john mccain mccain knew keating well his ties to the home builder dated to 1981 when the two men met at a navy league dinner where mccain was the speaker after the speech keating walked up to mccain and told him that he too was a navy flier and that he greatly respected mccains war record he met mccains wife and family the two men became friends charlie keating always took care of his friends especially those in politics john mccain was no exception in 1982 during mccains first run for the house keating held a fund raiser for him collecting more than 11 000 from 40 employees of american continental corp mccain would spend more than 550 000 to win the primary and the general election in 1983 during mccains second house race keating hosted a 1 000 a plate dinner for mccain though he had no serious competition and coasted into his second term when mccain pushed for the senate in 1986 keating was there with more than 50 000 by 1987 mccain had received about 112 000 in political contributions from keating and his associates mccain had also carried a little water for keating in washington while in the house mccain along with a majority of representatives co sponsored a resolution to delay new regulations designed to curb risky investments by thrifts like lincoln
6497319 im a democrat why does obama choose an issue for which he is equally able to get clobbered as an issue to go after mccain i e how rich mccain is i could never live the mccain life style but then again i dont own a chicago mansion or vacation in million dollar hawaiin beach houses why cant the democrats get smart about this election
6497320 obamas argument that he understand the economy better and that the republican candidate doesnt get it
6497321 do you really want mccain gramm and fiorina running the economy
6497322 heres the difference amnesty john and his wife paid for their homes with their own money
6497323 eating argula is more elitist than owing 7 homes youve got to be kidding
6497324 how many homes does ted kennedy own or does he shop at wal mart who cares world war 111 may be looming get the guy with experience and worldwide respect in the office that isnt obama
6497325 start at home or a hotel if theyre a special person
6497326 we tell the sons of france the slaves of america and their masters too that our finger is on the trigger and the convoys of martyrs are longing to rampage your bastions in defence of our islamic nation
6497327 we have repeatedly conveyed to the indian and world leaders that if the ongoing talks between india and pakistan fail to resolve kashmir issue the kashmiris will be compelled to head for another revolution but nobody listened to us at that time
6497328 today the situation is before everyone kashmiris have once again taken peaceful and democratic way to struggle for freedom
6497329 even children are raising their voice in support of freedom this is the democratic referendum and should be honoured

6497345 intel is finally becoming a player here and dreamworks will give them credibility
6497346 intel has the capability to bring real insights into the needs of stereo 3d in silicon and tools
6497347 there are a lot of interesting technologies to bring stereo 3d to the tv but it is still in an early stage
6497348 once the tv can handle todays polarized 3d glasses the technology will take off in a big way
6497349 the 3d tools used today have largely been created internally inside the studios
6497350 eliminating the cost of developing these tools will really help
6497351 the pc ification of stereo 3d could be a major catalyst for this transition
6497352 this is the biggest news to come out of idf
6497353 we are going to execute on the eds acquisition and we are going to bring the strength of hps operating discipline the strength of hps innovation the strength of hps position in the marketplace to make a combined business that we think will be quite competitive
6497354 as weve seen in the last few weeks currency rates can be at times volatile
6497355 if the dollar remains where it is today there will be downward pressure on our revenue but we will be able to come in on our earnings per share range
6497356 hp continued its string of earnings per share beats on the back of lower operating expenses
6497357 the imaging amp printing group was the only segment that missed our revenue and operating income targets a sign of lengthening lifecycles in the slower macro environment
6497358 we expect to close the eds acquisition by the end of august and this will result in a substantial cash usage for fiscal q4
6497359 we believe the acquisition and integration of eds should help hp manage the macroeconomic storm better than others
6497360 we see room for significant operating leverage particularly in fiscal 2010 regardless of economic conditions
6497361 the plan is going well and we are confident in the benefits this business combination will bring to customers partners and shareholders
6497362 the feedback from the vast majority of the customers that i talk to continues to be extremely positive as they contemplate the power of hps innovation coupled with eds scaled services business

6497369 were working hard to change the perception that we are just a blockage
6497370 during two world wars young men and women left te ngawai not knowing whether they would ever return to a place named by their fathers in good faith after the nearby river most of them were educated at the te ngawai school and at a time when few rural folk travelled any further than biking distance this te ngawai was home
6497371 so in the central south island alone thats put over 150 000 back into workers pockets yesterday alone
6497372 using the 700 million estimate as a starting point and based on south canterburys population we estimate local taxpayers could be eligible for 9 8 million in refunds that would be a significant boost to the local economy
6497373 its a bit like finding a lotto ticket in the bottom of the drawer you check it out and if theres a refund and you want to claim it we offer the best rates in new zealand you owe it to yourself to find out and the odds are pretty good
6497374 i can assure you we are well aware of the cost for people who have been unfortunately caught up in the fallout
6497375 but the likelihood of this being needed remains extremely low
6497376 with sales greatly increasing in the commuting category and other categories as well we are looking forward to introducing several new products at the show
6497377 as qbp has grown with the market interbike has been and will continue to be the best venue for us to launch new products
6497378 consumers are looking for ways to save money and they are looking to bikes to help them do that both in their daily life and for recreation interbike is a direct reflection of the marketplace and the increase in the number of exhibiting companies both international and domestic suggests the industry is very healthy and has opportunities for growth
6497379 it isnt a magic trick we work at it and if a product isnt good enough we cancel it

6497382 we havent seen the low cost carrier model here at the airport
6497383 were now starting to see that which i think has got significant upside we see the trans tasman and newer markets in asia such as china and india as being very important
6497384 we are in discussions with parties at this stage it would be great if it could be coincidental with the rwc but at the end of the day thats not the fundamental driver
6497385 there was also good growth in retail with the new facilities
6497386 were not expecting a lot in terms of passenger volumes its a year of fairly flat profits
6497387 if we had our four kids at home it would be tough but at the moment we are buying a lot less
6497388 the price of potatoes has gone up 5 in just a few weeks we are eating less vegetables and going without in some cases
6497389 compared to 10 years ago vegetables are really not that much dearer while wages have gone up
6497390 what about the poor grower who is not getting much money at all while the supermarkets take a big margin
6497391 peoples priorities have changed and they may spend 80 on sky a month but are not prepared to spend that on vegetables
6497392 the prices of fuel and fertilisers have gone up and so the prices of vegetables have gone up to reflect that
6497393 i have not bought fresh vegetables for a long time and tend to buy frozen now or veges on special
6497394 i worry about people with kids as it is cheaper for them to buy unhealthy rubbish food
6497395 it makes a difference to what i choose now i will buy half a cabbage or half a cauli and buy more frozen vegetables
6497396 it hasnt affected what i buy you still need vegetables but i just buy less of other things
6497397 i buy in season and tend to go to a few supermarkets as well as buy where it is the cheapest
6497398 we think targeted cuts make more sense and wed ask that people make their voices heard on that front
6497399 the moment i got into new zealand i was really inspired by the way they spoke to me
6497400 our wing has a lot of different nationalities and i think thats good for our country
6497401 im not saying every job is going to come back to martinsville just because im elected president im not saying that suddenly all the schools are going to be fixed
6497402 incredibly excited and pleased for the athletes that have done well
6497403 if we dont put more money in we are going to go backwards because the rest of the world is putting more in even if we keep investing we are probably only going to be treading water
6497404 swimming had it tough but i am sure we are all incredibly proud of what moss burmester did in the phelps race he finished fourth on a different day
6497405 i think they have been a little bit unlucky if they had been able to keep the spaniards out for the last seven seconds spain scored with seconds to go to win 1 0 they could have gone right through i think it is a talented team and its results do not reflect that talent
6497406 sam is in europe visiting various places he hung out at as a teenage exchange student
6497407 these cross country motor bikes are great for those of you who like not doing what youre told
6497408 this team has inherited the tag of inconsistency but i dont think thats fair
6497409 we still have a long way to go as a team and its only our fourth game of the competition its a long competition and upsets are already happening so thats a reality check for us
6497410 my first game for otago was against southland down there and we lost so i know how hard it will be
6497411 its a long way from home and very cold and they are playing good rugby
6497412 overall i think its good to talk to people about what is going on
6497413 its human nature people are scared of the other and we are the other people are scared to know us its amazing how little we know about each other
6497414 it is about people that often face prejudices in the community or find it hard to be accepted and they want to show that they are worthwhile
6497415 the police basically told me he had a shoe print on his face its disgusting i want the attacker done i want him charged
6497416 this big boy was there and he wanted to talk to me he didnt say nothing he just grabbed me from behind he looked like hed seen a ghost and then he pushed me on to the ground and started kicking what he did to me was cruel and i hope he gets caught
6497417 the moment i got into new zealand i was really inspired by the way they spoke to me
6497418 our wing has a lot of different nationalities and i think thats good for our country
6497419 he looked like he knew what he was doing with them
6497420 they just beat up anyone who looks at them the wrong way
6497421 the police were too scared to go in there they kept going up to the door and then hed start swinging again

6497424 that no additional action by the commission is warranted at this time
6497425 our board remains unwavering in its belief that eas unsolicited conditional tender offer of 25 74 per share was inadequate and undervalued world class entertainment franchises and our strong operational and financial performance
6497426 everything that constitutes good manners can be derived from four hadith
6497427 to the one to whom he limited his counsel with
6497428 and hasten to forgiveness from your lord and a garden whose width is that of the heavens and the earth prepared for the god fearing who spend in times of ease and times of hardship and who restrain their anger and who pardon people and allah loves those who do good
6497429 and what is with allah is better and more enduring for those who believe and who rely upon their lord and those who avoid the major sins and indecencies and when they become angry they forgive
6497430 the strong man is not the one who can throw another down the strong man is the one who can keep hold of himself when he is angry
6497431 i know a word that if one were to say it what stresses him would go away if he would but say i seek refuge with allah from satan the accursed
6497432 if one of you gets angry he should be quiet
6497433 if one of you gets angry and he is standing then he should sit down until his anger subsides if it does not then he should lie down
6497434 anger is from satan and satan was created from fire fire is but extinguished by water so if one of you gets angry he should perform wud
6497435 the prophet peace be upon him would never became angry for anything however if the sanctity of allah was profaned then nothing could assuage his anger
6497436 im rapt its something ive waited for for a while and its finally come the way the boys have stepped up from manawatu and on to otago and auckland theyve set a high benchmark and i just want to fit in
6497437 we do a lot of three on threes and franksys great he always brings a competitive edge and youve got to get in there and match it
6497438 campbells just world class so you dont need to say much more and then theres crockzilla crockett the crockzilla is always good at keeping you on your toes
6497439 i rate crocky as one of the most destructive looseheads in the country and if i can match him up at training then what better benchmark
6497440 thats one of the good things about working alongside crocky and c j theyre more than happy to put down a few three on threes and teach me loosehead
6497441 its important to be able to play both and crusaders and tasman prop ben franks is a good example of that during the super 14 he was able to come in and play both sides at the drop of a hat
6497442 i think you do have to be a bit weird and campbell johnstone would be a good example of that i really enjoy the banter and obviously i havent played npc yet but at club level its great
6497443 theres some old heads around the comp and you chew each others ear off a bit and then laugh about it after the game
6497444 its a different club to be involved in and great to be involved in
6497445 it works both ways and if the scrum is no good theyll let us know about it
6497446 hes still having a few problems with his wrist so its probably not up to playing a game of football as yet
6497447 mate he leads by example jonny hes got a lot of respect from the guys around him and thats what you want from your captain
6497448 hes a very good footballer you know even though hes getting on a wee bit he still puts his hand up every week he trains hard every week hes as close as what weve got to a professional
6497449 hes been an outstanding footballer for a long long time
6497450 itll be great to see him playing at a higher level
6497451 im pretty hopeful were going to have a good year with this team
6497452 that was so much more encouraging i felt heaps better and im really looking forward to the final now
6497453 i suppose if i have to give some odds now i might be 10 1
6497454 there is a lot of depth here but an olympic final is a funny thing because there is a huge amount pressure it can be really frightening if you let it so well have to see how everyone copes
6497455 i think it is pretty much same conditions for everyone all the lanes are fair
6497456 theres so much interest in them and whats happening now is people end up paying top price for them anyway
6497457 probably the reverse is now true and they see it as a marketing tactic and it may actually not be a mortgagee property at all
6497458 real estate agents will pick up on anything to get a sale and if they think more and more people are after mortgagee sales theyll call it anything to get a sale theyll use any tactic
6497459 it makes me a wee bit suspicious when theyre passed in are they genuine mortgagee sales
6497460 there could well be the perception that you will get a bargain its not necessarily the case

6497481 if they can beat canterbury theyll be happy and we wouldnt want it any other way we set ourselves a really high standard and try to get to it each week and if a team wants to try and bring us down thats a real motivating factor for us
6497482 im actually really happy with the way were tracking at the moment our gain line in the sense of getting past the advantage line on first and second phase has been really high and it helps when youve got strong runners like centre adam whitelock
6497483 im feeling pretty good myself and when youve got guys around you who are playing well its pretty easy to play well yourself im enjoying the role ive got in the team at the moment playing at 12 and the style were playing under pens rob penney and hags john haggart

6497487 haydens had so many setbacks during his career he deserves this break
6497488 he lost a lot of money it was bad investments but cycling would have lost him because of it
6497489 it was just to keep him going so he didnt have that extra pressure
6497490 its such a hard sport you cant have things worrying you in your mind when you go out training for five to six hour sessions you just cant
6497491 hes an awesome talent and he just needed a little help
6497492 he wouldnt have been able to win two medals without their help

6497517 its been a privilege to work with such a talented dedicated young man i think what youll see now is kids getting out on windsurfers wanting to be the next tom ashley its not an expensive sport to get into
6497518 i think he should show more respect shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones
6497519 i would love him to show more respect to his competitors he should learn that he should shake hands with competitors
6497520 i understand the joy he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived is catch me if you can you dont do that
6497521 he was just enthusiastic very happy and there was never any animosity it was from within

6497523 hes very funny playful happy and thats what came out after he ran
6497524 bolt must be considered now the same way like jesse owens should have been in the 30s it is different in that bolt has a bigger edge than owens in his finals

6497531 i think they have been a little bit unlucky if they had been able to keep the spaniards out for the last seven seconds spain scored with seconds to go to win 1 0 they could have gone right through i guess we are going to have to sit down with hockey and review how it went i think it is a talented team and its results dos not reflect that talent
6497532 that demonstrates you have to be in this environment to taste it to know what it is like

6497543 we were playing with a guy sylvester that could really play electric bass and i feel the band has really moved ahead in leaps and bounds
6497544 it has been quite a journey for me to come back to my roots musically and creatively with ratdog
6497545 really get back to where i started creative stretching rock and roll playing where all bets are off it is always a trip though because you dont know where a song is going to go sometimes you think youll have a small little tune and it will stretch out to 20 minutes long
6497546 i didnt really have a sense of what to expect from myself
6497547 i was off for almost a year as it worked out though its a lot like riding a bike i was doing it for nearly 10 years and when i got back on that stage at that first show back my recollection was that it was a really fun show

6497560 how many of these people are there who were the beneficiaries of this process
6497561 this is what happens when the best intentions are misapplied
6497562 if there was any justification for this program cases like this certainly undermine that expectation

6497582 i offered to come out to san francisco for a second interview but they paid for my travel
6497583 i dont care how much technology there is one thing hasnt changed people still do the hiring
6497584 i was approached by a recruiter near boston who understood my situation and who made the initial interviews over the phone after the second call they asked me in for an in person interview which eventually led to the management job i now have
6497585 they did play well i said last week that they would and they did
6497586 but everyone was all through the court it wasnt easy when we lost megan but katie crow and liz tuki came on and played strong

6497590 we couldnt find a definitive cause for reason of the level of damage there was no evidence of an electrical fault or that mice and rats had been chewing through cables or anything like that
6497591 because it was a war memorial hall the honours board was in the main hall im not sure what records there are of that
6497592 i would hate to think it was arson it means too much to the community for someone to do something like that
6497593 i live under that roll of cheese and helped put up the wind wand so these results are no good for me
6497594 well they are putting another tank up there so they could paint one as a gruyere and another as a feta or something they need to put a bit of imagination into that i suppose

6497602 the time is now for congress to weigh not only the enormous financial burden that this fatally flowed legislation would place on taxpayers but also to consider the fact that these bills would likely encourage irresponsible building and rebuilding in destructions path and carelessly putting fragile oceanfront ecosystems in jeopardy
6497603 we shouldnt displace productive private insurance and reinsurance industries with expensive unworkable government programs
6497604 the house and senate conferees on the national flood insurance program should take a very careful look at this groundbreaking study above all else we need to create an insurance environment that preserves the environment and encourages safe effective building a national catastrophe policy commission could play an important role pointing the way towards a better system for managing catastrophes

6497608 two men apparently blew themselves up outside the factory during a shift change the bombers were on foot and they exploded themselves less than a minute apart
6497609 directed the authorities to make efforts to expose the hidden hands behind the incident
6497610 our bombers carried out todays attack it is in reaction to military operations in swat and bajaur
6497611 similar attacks will be carried out in other cities of pakistan including lahore islamabad and rawalpindi
6497612 i was working in the factory when i heard one blast and then another they were huge
6497613 security people then immediately surrounded the place and we were not allowed to go outside

6497648 he said create as much diversity as you can and then sieve out the best characteristics
6497649 thats just a genetic variation if you overanalyse you dont get these crosses you miss out
6497650 its grown reasonably well here but im not sure that it has been marketed to any extent
6497651 a plant will sell itself once it starts growing but if you dont seriously market it it can take 10 years to catch on

6497690 essentially what theyre doing is really not thinking at all theyre just listening to music and being in a space before they actually get ready to narrow their focus
6497691 you have to also plan for contingency if you forgot your music or something happens

6497718 dif cil denominarlo urbano es un semi permanente normal y corriente pero con las vallas pegadas en las rectas es el polo opuesto a m naco
6497719 diferente a m naco o a lo que ser singapur
6497720 hay tramos ciegos pero en teor a las banderas amarillas tendr an que ayudar en caso de que en una curva que no pudieras ver a la salida si hay alguien parado
6497721 del mismo modo continuaba hay partes que se estrechan bastante como la zona del puente pero son los riesgos y trampas que tiene todo circuito urbano m naco no permite ning n error y valencia pese a ser m s ancho menos bacheado y estar todo m s calculado no va a permitir tampoco errores esa es la salsa de los circuitos urbano
6497722 a trescientos kil metros por hora va a cambiar mucho respecto a las sensaciones al caminarlo hoy se va a volver todo m s estrecho y m s dif cil pero as a priori es de esos circuitos que te gustan bien preparado todo calculado a estrenar todo nuevo
6497723 de hecho prosegu a hay curvas que ahora piensas que son de una manera y luego te subes al coche y algunas partes no tienen nada que ver con lo que hab as programado cuando te subas seguro que hay sorpresas pero lo m s importante es aprovechar las tres horas que tendremos de entrenamiento para dar el mayor n mero de vueltas para tener m s confianza

6497740 saving water from field to fork curbing losses and wastage in the food chain
6497741 as much as half of the water used to grow food globally may be lost or wasted
6497742 curbing these losses and improving water productivity provides win win opportunities for farmers business ecosystems and the global hungry an effective water saving strategy requires that minimising food wastage is firmly placed on the political agenda
6497743 unless we change our practices water will be a key constraint to food production in the future
6497744 improving water productivity and reducing the quantity of food that is wasted can enable us to provide a better diet for the poor and enough food for growing populations
6497745 reaching the target we propose a 50 percent reduction of losses and wastage in the production and consumption chain is a necessary and achievable goal

6498209 everything has been agreed with abdoulaye in fact it was all agreed at the back end of last week
6498210 unfortunately the work permit situation isnt as straightforward because he hasnt played the requisite number of games for the application to go straight through
6498211 however having gone through it with abdoulaye the reason he hasnt played the games is because he has been injured
6498212 we have been in constant contact with the home office and we have got an agreement with them that providing we can prove he wasnt selected because he was injured then they will approve that work permit application
6498213 what we require from that to put it simply is a certification from the international team doctor that he was not fit or available for selection in those games then we need a statement from the international team manager confirming that had the player been fit he would have selected him

6498222 we plan on pay raises work bonuses and other monies to come forward but we cannot be thinking this way we need to start saving money every day
6498223 planning too far in advance not only makes consumers over optimistic regarding how much they will save but it also makes them behave in more aggressive and risk seeking ways in other financial arenas
6498224 the easiest thing to do is to be a smarter consumer and make spending and saving decisions thoughtfully on a daily basis that extra cup of coffee every morning carpooling with a co worker and cutting out the extras

6498477 when we celebrate birthdays and wedding anniversaries we are imitating other religions something that our prophet peace be upon him warned us against

6498488 they will not be in a position to elect the speaker and deputy speaker of parliament and these are very important positions they could lose that opportunity to zanu pf party
6498489 yes the mdc says if parliament is convened it is a violation of the memorandum of understanding which was the document that set the agenda for talks and in that document the parties agreed that parliament would not be reconvened without consensus however it may come down to deciding what is the best option on the day because the talks have not reached an agreement yet regarding a possible government of national unity and the leaders in southern africa are very keen that this agreement be reached as soon as possible but there are disagreements about what powers will be held by the various parties and particularly the party leaders in such a cabinet

6498546 as outlined in donum vitae uncontrolled use of ahr technologies could lead to unforeseeable consequences for civil society recourse to the conscience of each individual and to the self regulation of researchers cannot be sufficient for ensuring respect for personal rights and public order this is however the condition in which ahr treatment is carried out in ireland
6498547 the questionable practice of the surplus production of human embryos the development of the method of ivf necessitates inestimable fertilisations and destructions of human embryos the embryos that are not transferred to the mothers womb are referred to as spare some are frozen and some are destroyed the association between ivf and the intentional destruction of human embryos occurs too frequently
6498548 constitutes an offence against the dignity and respect due to human beings by leaving them vulnerable and exposed to grave risks of death or harm to their physical well being
6498549 may relieve the woman of the cost and the physical burden of further egg retrievals in the ivf process and may also temporarily preserve the life of the embryo
6498550 it brings with it extremely worrying medical ethical and legal issues during the lengthy period between fertilisation and implantation which cryopreservation permits
6498551 it is in these instances that the embryo is treated as a means to an end and as a commodity rather than as an end in and for itself
6498552 a clear distinction made between the embryo formed in vivo and the embryo formed through ivf one is deemed entitled to legal protection and one undeserving of legal protection there already exists protection for the unborn in the irish constitution this piece of legislation needs to be defined further so that the law can protect the unborn child
6498553 some of the polish friends i have consulted appreciate the occasional opportunity to keep in touch with their cultural roots but they do not think that a separate sunday liturgy would help in the important work of integration within the local catholic community this is also the view of the clergy in the area
6498554 we want to pay for the church and help to maintain it we dont want it for free
6498555 when you go to mass you have to feel like you are talking to god and expressing yourself to god you have to do that in your own language
6498556 you cannot take in a dictionary and translate the words
6498557 asking for a weekly mass is something basic and now we have to fight for it our religious life here is very basic its really the bare minimum many people in poland go to church on a daily basis
6498558 we know we are in england not in poland and we dont have to stay here
6498559 but we are here and if its possible for us to have mass then we would really appreciate it
6498560 many people including some poles felt it was becoming divisive
6498561 some poles felt that if there was polish mass they had a loyalty and they werent sure whether to go to the usual english mass
6498562 poles were not getting the opportunity to get to know the catholic community and the clergy werent getting the opportunity to get to know the polish people
6498563 maintain their own traditions and at the same time keep in touch with the english church
6498564 very few companies from the transportation industry are part of the climate leaders program
6498565 pure luxury transportation is helping show the epa that chauffeured ground transportation companies can demonstrate a serious commitment to environmental sustainability
6498566 our goal is not only to contribute to the improved health of our planet but to satisfy the increasing demand for an environmentally sustainable transportation provider a demand set by corporations governments and public audiences
6498567 we are passionate about reducing our environmental footprint and are proud of our reduction results qualifying for inclusion in the climate leaders program only strengthens our determination to achieve further carbon reductions
6498568 if you keep a clean sheet then you obviously have a better chance of winning or getting something out of a game
6498569 one of the things is that we have competition for places at the back and also in other areas
6498570 we thought seven points out of nine in the first three games would be good so its up to us if we beat them on saturday we will get that
6498571 yeah thats why i was really excited about coming back here with the players hes brought in i mean no disrespect to last years team but i think this team as a whole in depth as well is really strong
6498572 so far its just been the end product really its not like we are not making chances it just comes down to putting them in the back of the net
6498573 were in for a hard season there are no ifs buts or maybes about it
6498574 this season is going to be a very difficult one because were already up and running and still trying to gel a whole squad together
6498575 walking on to hampden was a brilliant feeling i loved it
6498576 it was very special feeling making my debut and it was an honour to get on
6498577 there were definitely some nerves but sometimes they get you through a game i will go back to training at falkirk and im sure the boys will cane me as usual it will be back to normal
6498578 but you want to be doing well for your club because you never know whats round the corner in football
6498579 its only one game but it was definitely an opportunity for me to stake my claim for a place in the scotland squad for the world cup qualifiers but i need to get my head down and not take anything for granted
6498580 we probably have as many good youngsters now as we have ever had at the club
6498581 jamie duff iain vigurs and garry are coming through and rory has been on the fringes for the last two years it is time he came through and showed what he can do
6498582 adam rooney is 20 and andy barrowman is 23 so we have the nucleus of a young squad now which is good for me as hopefully i can use my experience to help them
6498583 he looked like he knew what he was doing with them
6498584 they just beat up anyone who looks at them the wrong way
6498585 the police were too scared to go in there they kept going up to the door and then hed start swinging again
6498586 gathered in the mall and small pockets of fighting broke out
6498587 just give me 6 yards and catch it make the plays that are there not the wow play every time
6498588 we have been waiting for this moment for 15 years
6498589 we made sure that visitors could arrive and depart from sydney without any fuss
6498590 he was an outstanding party member a long tested and loyal communist fighter and proletarian revolutionary
6498591 we support these efforts because of the valuable mutually beneficial partnership the government run union offers and because of their commitment to assisting businesses in our growth and development in china
6498592 is this an admission by wal mart that it wasnt paying enough i dont know
6498593 trade unions of the foreign invested enterprises in china have firmly centered on production and business operation to conduct activities and have given support to enterprises in their operation and management according to law have educated workers to observe factory rules and regulations and discipline organized workers to launch labor emulation campaigns and aroused the enthusiasm of the workers for running the enterprises well so as to contribute to the sound development of the enterprises
6498594 i have no idea why we cant win a final its something im gonna keep asking myself for a long time you keep asking what you did wrong
6498595 brazil kept pressuring and we felt that it was just a matter of time before the ball would go in
6498596 when you give people chances and allow them to come back from their mistake great things happen and im a perfect example
6498597 you shouldnt give up on people and people can still do great things in their lives it doesnt matter whats happened
6498598 prices have climbed on renewed geopolitical tensions between the us and russia with the latter voicing its displeasure over a us poland defence pact whereby the us can station defence shield missiles in poland much to russias dislike
6498599 crude futures were higher on thursday extending gains from yesterday on weakness in the dollar and persistent geopolitical fears
6498600 the latest diplomatic stand off with russia over georgia has once again reminded investors of the markets sensitivity to all kinds of geopolitical risks
6498601 these also include persistent tensions in the middle east and violence in nigeria
6498602 were trying to keep him off his feet so he doesnt re open that wound
6498603 were going to be a little cautious with him to try to get it healed up because at his position where he runs and cuts the thing that we dont want to happen is we dont want him to break it open
6498604 eu n o descarto a possibilidade da mirian mudar de id ia no futuro
6498605 onde que t tava que eu n o te achei antes
6498606 henry kissinger dizia que o poder era o supremo afrodis aco eu discordo acho que o qi
6498607 whats becoming quite apparent is that the way you actually have an impact on health development and poverty alleviation is when people adopt certain behaviours
6498608 its just a matter of getting them to understand that what is a long established habit is in fact harmful and that you can do something about it
6498609 we actually use shame we go into communities and say to people do you realise how fecally contaminated your community is
6498610 we do walks of shame where you take a group of people and you walk around and you say look heres some human faeces
6498611 and you do this community mapping where everybody comes and says where they defecate
6498612 and you get them to realise how disgusting this is to live in an environment that is totally contaminated
6498613 and once they start using a toilet even if its just a pit latrine they refuse to go back to open defecation so they begin to climb the sanitation ladder
6498614 families were spending money on treating diarrhoea and other diseases but would not spend money on installing a toilet because they expected to be given money for that by aid groups
6498615 two men apparently blew themselves up outside the factory during a shift change the bombers were on foot and they exploded themselves less than a minute apart
6498616 directed the authorities to make efforts to expose the hidden hands behind the incident
6498617 our bombers carried out todays attack it is in reaction to military operations in swat and bajaur
6498618 similar attacks will be carried out in other cities of pakistan including lahore islamabad and rawalpindi
6498619 i was working in the factory when i heard one blast and then another they were huge
6498620 security people then immediately surrounded the place and we were not allowed to go outside
6498621 as staff were leaving after finishing their days duty and it was very crowded
6498622 bush assured him that us support will continue for pakistan its government and democratic forces
6498623 how are we dealing with these types of backward compatibility issues
6498624 how are we dealing with these types of backward gt compatibility issues
6498625 its nothing major it just hurts a little when i try to make catches and stuff
6498626 it is ironically a very similar situation to whats going on between apa and american airlines

6498631 it was an olympic final and an olympic final is like nothing else all i wanted to do was win the medal
6498632 the track was wet so i tried not to force things you know that if you slip up in hurdles you can end up on the ground very easily
6498633 i was very calm since the games been trying to be as relaxed as possible
6498634 im still relaxed im not euphoric by any means yet
6498635 you never know if youre going to win ive known so many hurdlers who have clipped the last hurdle and lost the race
6498636 i could not drop my guard i was never overconfident
6498637 i have great admiration for the chinese a great nation
6498638 they demonstrate time and again they know and love their athletes
6498639 its a shame that liu was not racing because it would have been spectacular
6498640 liu xiang has always been a very good competitor and athlete you can feel it when hes on the track with you
6498641 i didnt feel good when he withdrew i know what he represents to the chinese people hes a hero in china let me take this opportunity to wish him a speedy recovery
6498642 even though it wasnt the ending i wanted i wouldnt trade the last four years for anything
6498643 i almost lost it on the platform to go out on a good note at least made me feel really good
6498644 i wouldnt change a minute of it we can go back do it all over again if she likes that would be fine with me
6498645 an analogy of what a sore triceps is like when youre trying to hold an entry on 10 meter is pulling a hamstring and having to run a 100 yard dash
6498646 how good are you going to be when you dont have the capability of holding it the confidence goes out the door youre more worried about the injury than anything else at that point
6498647 she didnt hold one entry she cant and once you know that youre being protective through the whole list
6498648 shes up in age and shes been up there a long long long time
6498649 i didnt land on my head enough for it to bother me
6498650 if you have any rich friends send them my way
6498651 the economy is stuck somewhere between sluggish growth and recession
6498652 the decline in the leading index should therefore not be interpreted as a sign the outlook is quickly deteriorating
6498653 thats critical while consumers may be cautious and conservative in their spending as long as the rate does not spike there should be enough income growth to keep the economy muddling along
6498654 we have clearly experienced a slowing of business in our brick and mortar stores most notably in florida where the tax free sales event was canceled this year
6498655 the first two and a half weeks of august have been below our internal plan for both hot topic and torrid
6498656 at this point our best estimate for our august consolidated same store sales is a mid single digit decline consistent with our current performance
6498657 we continue to believe that the company is making great progress and we further believe that the assortment at the hot topic stores looks better than it has in a long time
6498658 that said we believe the ongoing tough compares in novelty tees at hot topic and the challenging economic environment will probably keep a lid on any same store sales upside in the near term

6498677 my diet has a lot to do with my getting into shape i have no sugar i dont eat fruit or even fruit juice because of the sugar i eat chicken and salmon and rice i eat avocados ill have egg whites for breakfast and sometimes turkey burgers for lunch i try to do just 1 200 calories a day it may sound like its not much but its actually a lot of food if you eat the right things

6498681 la provincia lo nico que va a hacer cuando use recursos es exponerlos mediante un bono que va a pagar intereses y va a estar garantizado cien por ciento con coparticipaci n federal

6498683 se termina con el d ficit de la caja del bapro haci ndose cargo la provincia de la estructura deficitaria de esa caja y esos recursos van a salir de rentas generales
6498684 no afecta derechos de los actuales jubilados ni de los activos y futuros jubilados
6498685 no se unifica ninguna caja todas mantienen su propia administraci n y no se compensan resultados deficitarios con super vit ni se crea un nuevo organismo

6498687 el organismo rector es el ips y el organismo coordinador es el ministerio de econom a y se incorpora a la caja del bapro dentro del sistema del ips que hasta ahora no lo estaba

6498689 wel gaan we met ac milan contact opnemen om over een compensatie te praten
6498690 have not finished because it is known who are behind the tragedy
6498691 here it is known who is behind this and since i dont have a straw tail let the others explain what they did or failed to do
6498692 how many bottles of medicine were taken from the market how many were delivered and what did they do in the more separated areas where they were given
6498693 what we can hope for from someone who has demonstrated a failure to not leave behind this undemocratic practice of censorship
6498694 in panama there have been truly scandalous cases among them the cemis which has remained silent but i believe that many people will have much to explain if the investigations were reopened and if political pressure from some sectors did not exist
6498695 no han terminado porque se sabe qui nes est n detr s de esa tragedia

6498710 in this order and by this succession the ecclesiastical tradition from the apostles and the preaching of the truth have come down to us and this is most abundant proof that there is one and the same vivifying faith which has been preserved in the church from the apostles until now and handed in truth
6498711 wherefore it is incumbent to obey the presbyters who are in the church those who as i have shown possess succession from the apostles those who together with the succession of bishops have received the certain gift of truth according to the good pleasure of the father but it is also incumbent to hold in suspicion others who depart from the primitive succession of the succession and assemble themselves but those who cleave asunder and separate the unity of the church shall recieve from god the same punishments as jeroboam did
6498712 i voted for the 87 billion before i voted against it
6498713 i was surprised about the amount of serves they were missing and the errors they were making
6498714 that came with us keeping the pressure that tends to happen when you start passing their serves so easy they want to serve harder or they try to take a little bit off and it becomes too easy
6498715 cuba killed us with their serve last time its one of their biggest weapons the way they handled us before i dont think they were expecting for us to come out and be as prepared as we were
6498716 its not because im not happy its more for the players its their dream
6498717 cramer calls out what he regarded to be fraudulent destruction of freddy and fannie shameful actions of the fed sec treasury and whitehouse the damage being done to market capitalism and directly implies that our economy is being illegally manipulated by insiders
6498718 finding things on web servers that were never meant to be found
6498719 somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have
6498720 true quote im not sure ill have to check with my staff so they asked his staff and he said at least four at least four
6498721 now think about that i guess if you think that being rich means you gotta make five million dollars and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6498722 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you were like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so that they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6498723 what people are going thru every single day here in america
6498724 most people do not think that young people have strokes
6498725 but the point people should really understand is that they can occur in utero they can occur in the neonatal period and they can occur in older children there are noticeable differences in presentation risk factors and the prognosis in children compared to older adults however
6498726 people are like kids dont have strokes so i still think theres a lot of work to be done in terms of awareness
6498727 a summary of the argument which must contain a succinct clear and accurate statement of the arguments made in the body of the brief and which must not merely repeat the argument headings
6498728 for each issue a concise statement of the applicable standard of review which may appear in the discussion of the issue or under a separate heading placed before the discussion of the issue
6498729 all briefs under this rule must be concise presented with accuracy logically arranged with proper headings and free from burdensome irrelevant immaterial or scandalous matters
6498730 it really comes down to the drivers at the end of the day they changed the track at bristol but you can still beat and bang i think the drivers have started to realize that the penalties for doing that arent worth the rewards
6498731 one spot is not worth the risk to your own car and whatever goes with that as far as angering another driver and getting it back 10 times worse than what you gave it either that night or a night later its still going to be a great race at bristol
6498732 uma pena a equipe perder essa medalha de ouro elas mereciam melhor sorte mereciam pelo menos um empate na prorroga o
6498733 a equipe deu o seu melhor em campo elas n o perderam mas sim conquistaram a medalha de prata
6498734 sou melhor que cristiano ronaldo se eu jogasse em uma liga como a
6498735 tenho dois pr mios de melhor do mundo mas precisava deste t tulo com a sele o brasileira
6498736 chegamos duas vezes na final mas desperdi amos a oportunidade
6498737 a gente fica se perguntando o que acontece com o time nas finais em outras partidas a bola entra de toda maneira vou ficar me perguntando por muito tempo o que aconteceu aqui diante dos estados unidos
6498738 depois de pensar muito quero anunciar publicamente que vou dedicar me apenas fiorentina
6498739 h dez anos fa o parte do grupo da sele o mas o fato de eu n o ter sido chamado me fez refletir e compreender que n o fa o parte dos planos futuros da equipe
6498740 ele me deu poucas oportunidades para jogar ficarei de lado mas n o quero criar pol micas nem perder tempo respeito as escolhas dele e n o quero lhe faltar com o respeito
6498741 futbol sticamente el partido para nosotros fue bueno el resultado es malo pero hablando de lo que quisimos probar del riesgo ofensivo que hicimos al final jugar con tres delanteros netos un 10 enlace y dos marcadores de punta con ataque me parece bueno
6498742 no triunfamos pero mejoramos en la retenci n del bal n que no la tuvimos en el ltimo partido de las eliminatorias tambi n con ecuador
6498743 la selecci n colombia dej una imagen de confusi n y dudas muy pobre en ataque sin virtudes ofensivas en la media cancha y con imprecisiones en la defensa perdi merecidamente
6498744 el gran interrogante que deja el equipo es si ese va a ser el nivel de juego para enfrentar a uruguay en bogot el pr ximo 6 de septiembre
6498745 con m s fallas que aciertos se fogue colombia el juego colectivo de otras oportunidades no se vio y las individualidades no alcanzaron para que consiguiera un buen bot n antes de reanudar la eliminatoria suramericana hacia sud frica 2010
6498746 o rufus fez uma tima olimp ada e a quinta posi o foi um bom resultado sim
6498747 mas lamento a falta que cometemos no primeiro percurso foi por pouco
6498748 o rufus muito novo tem apenas dez anos e com certeza poder participar de mais uma edi o dos jogos por ser t o jovem acabou ficando dif cil para ele brigar com cavalos mais experientes al m de que come ou a disputar provas com obst culos nesta altura apenas este ano e mesmo assim j chegou brigando por medalha nos jogos de pequim
6498749 o vasco emitiu um documento afirmando que h um interesse e este interesse ser discutido aqui pela diretoria para que possamos dar uma resposta temos interesse desde que seja bom para as tr s partes para o vasco para o barueri e para o atleta
6498750 no meio de uma partida se surge alguma situa o que a gente venha a discordar n o d para falar carlinhos meu querido por isso discutimos mas isso bom para todos pois mostra que os jogadores do fluminense est o ligados dentro de campo e dispostos a fazer de tudo pelo resultado positivo depois do gol nos abra amos e fizemos as pazes
6498751 and how to purchase the book we hope you will visit their sites
6498752 infelizmente perdemos o jorge henrique que vem atravessando uma grande fase e tem tudo para melhorar ainda mais ele seria muito importante contra o vasco assim como foi contra o cruzeiro j que se movimenta muito na frente e atrapalha a marca o por m temos outros atletas de qualidade no elenco do botafogo e com todo a certeza vou escolher um substituto altura
6498753 n o tenho muito o que falar daquele jogo pois considerei que a minha expuls o foi injusta naquela ocasi o nem sabia que ia ter o julgamento nesta sexta feira se puder estarei l no tribunal

6498762 its not a matter of throwing more money at it thats a stupid solution an extra 300 or 500 a month is not going to turn anyone into an olympic medallist you need to build the infrastructure of sport in canada from the grassroots up we need to have olympians out in the schools talking to kids we need to be out talking to corporate sponsors to better fund canadian amateur sport
6498763 i regret the fact that a woman led irans team in the olympics opening

6498765 well play however much coach phillips says we will play
6498766 obviously everybody wants to win the super bowl my goal is different my mentality is i want to win a super bowl but we cant win a super bowl without winning a playoff game so my thinking is lets win a playoff game
6498767 if you go back and watch that game i felt like i could have done more
6498768 i used to run that way back in high school before i started getting all technical with everything i just came in and said i was going to open up and let it fly
6498769 when i tried to make my move like i usually do coming off the turn it just wasnt there

6498781 yesterday john mccain was asked again what do you think about the economy he said i think the economy is fundamentally strong
6498782 now this puzzled me i was confused what he meant but then there was another interview where somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have and he said im not sure ill have to check with my staff true quote im not sure ill have to check with my staff so they asked his staff and they said at least four at least four now think about that i guess if you think that being rich means you make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then it is not surprising that you think the economy is fundamentally strong but if you are like me and youve got one house or if you are like the millions of people struggling now to keep up with your mortgage payments you might have a different perspective by the way the answer is john mccain has seven homes
6498783 good job it was an interesting talk but can you please quit playing with the keys in your pocket next time

6498787 i dont find myself particularly scary or particularly risky but i mean theyre good at it so theyve got these ads with paris hilton and britney spears and theyve got some guy who just a wrote a book he just makin stuff up just makes stuff up but it gets a lot of play on fox news after a while people start thinking god he does have a funny name or believing false rumors about me they get in e mails about obamas religion or patriotism
6498788 if he cant handle a book and the first amendment if hes in the oval office all the enemies of the united states need to do to rattle him is to publish a cartoon about him or write a book

6498802 for all practical purposes military to military cooperation had really already been ended with the russians
6498803 i cant imagine a circumstance right now that we would engage in military cooperation with the russians until the situation in georgia is resolved
6498804 we still have some very important issues that we need to work with russia on

6498821 this is what makes you want to see this chicago cubs team lose among all baseball fans i cant attest to the yankees and red sox because we dont see them with any degree of regularity unless its interleague play but far and away the most obnoxious fans in baseball in this league are those who follow this team right here throwing 15 or 18 balls on the field theres absolutely no excuse for that and that is so typical of chicago cub fans its unbelievable
6498822 throwing the ball back thats great thats a chicago cub tradition that other teams have picked up on and thats fine
6498823 its ridiculous it really is you simply root against them ive said all winter people talk about this team winning the division and my comment is they wont win it because at the end of the day theyre still the chicago cubs and they will figure out a way to screw this whole thing up

6498836 even if universal is correct that fair use only excuses infringement the fact remains that fair use is a lawful use of a copyright
6498837 accordingly in order for a copyright owner to proceed under the dmca with a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner its agent or the law the owner must evaluate whether the material makes fair use of the copyright
6498838 allegation that a copyright owner acted in bad faith by issuing a takedown notice without proper consideration of the fair use doctrine thus is sufficient to state a misrepresentation claim
6498839 while these concerns are understandable their actual impact likely is overstated although there may be cases in which such considerations will arise there are likely to be few in which a copyright owners determination that a particular use is not fair use will meet the requisite standard of subjective bad faith required to prevail in an action for misrepresentation

6499022 unfounded charges of anti jewish sentiments not only malign the innocent they also create a boy who cried wolf syndrome in that they may well render society insensitive to real bigotry when it does come along i have known chris ferrara and michael matt for many years the notion that they hate jews is so absurd as to be beneath contempt
6499023 it is time for us to recognize the charge of anti semitism for what it often is a political weapon intended to silence critics of liberalism
6499024 preaching anti semitism to as many as 100 000 followers
6499025 abased himself by entering a synagogue this time in cologne to listen to the vain prayers of liberal rabbis who condone abortion divorce and gay rights

6499031 the greatest fault of the splc report is its lumping all traditionalists into the anti semitism category there are some authentically anti semitic people within catholic traditionalism but i also know that they are not representative of the movement
6499032 i have a suggestion perhaps the splc could use a small portion of its substantial endowment to fund an investigatory team consisting of catholics who know the church its history and the faith and who know how to conduct an investigation that will end up being factually correct

6499035 seduce many of the jewish people by attempting to fulfill the political aspirations they held for the messiah
6499036 the 1911 catholic encyclopedia predicts the anti christ will come from jewry
6499037 t is in reality out of the tribe of dan then that tyrant and king that dread judge that son of the devil is destined to spring and arise above all moreover he will love the nation of the jews and with all these jews he will work signs and terrible wonders false wonders and not true in order to deceive his impious equals and after that he will build the temple in jerusalem and will restore it again speedily and give it over to the jews
6499038 having beguiled the jews by the lying signs and wonders of his magical deceit until they believe he is the expected christ he shall afterwards be characterized by all manner of wicked deeds of inhumanity and lawlessness as if to outdo all the unjust and impious men who have gone before him
6499039 jerusalem jerusalem thou that stoneth the prophets and killeth those that are sent to thee how often would i have gathered together thy children as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings but thou wouldst not behold thy house shall be left to thee desolate
6499040 i know the blasphemy of them which say they are jews and are not but are the synagogue of satan behold i will bring of the synagogue of satan who say they are jews and are not but do lie

6499050 we plead for the most esteemed pontiff to strongly condemn the intended upcoming sacrilege
6499051 jews against anti christian defamation was organized because we recognize that christians are the last remaining obstacle to the moral deconstruction of america because attacks on christians are motivated by hatred for the values they espouse
6499052 american society is in a headlong drive to normalize perversion and demonize dissent
6499053 from anti semitic teachings what anti semitic teachings and the idea of forcing its view of the world on unbelievers
6499054 the shadowy world of radical traditionalist catholicism also known as integrism or catholic separatism this religious subcultures teachings have little in common with the modern roman catholic church and its universalistic theology
6499055 two christians in australia have been indicted for criticizing islam and another for criticizing zionism

6499062 i am saying with certitude with a logical certitude that the group in western civilization and perhaps in world civilization with the most potential to act as a catalyst for a moral counterattack pushing back the barbarians are catholics
6499063 a clear conversion to doctrinal orthodoxy after the frightening abandonments following the council and i hold a return also to adoration therefore also a return to the bimillenial liturgy of the church
6499064 the disaster the actual cultural destruction represented by the prohibition of the liturgy of saint pius v and the disappearance of latin as sacred language of the catholic church
6499065 the effects were disastrous the road to incredible abuses in the liturgy was opened
6499066 the mainstream traditionalist movement is right about so much about nearly everything one is tempted to say but it is plagued with a few malcontents whose understanding of doctrine and liturgy is proportionate to their docility and sweet temperedness
6499067 a continuing process of decay that has gone on largely on the basis of appeals to the council
6499068 if the world hates you know that it has hated me before you if you had been of the world the world would love its own but because you are not of the world but i have chosen you out of the world therefore the world hates you

6499105 the pullback of russian forces is taking place at such a tempo that by the end of aug 22 they will be in the zones of responsibility of russian peacekeepers
6499106 we are waiting for the russians to respect their word
6499107 we waited twice with dashed hopes this time it appears that there is at least the beginning of a fulfillment
6499108 there has not been much evidence of any significant russian withdrawals there have been what i would call some minimal movements to date

6499111 no one can escape the down draught of the whole market coming down but we have performed better than our peers

6499113 we havent seen the low cost carrier model here at the airport
6499114 were now starting to see that which i think has got significant upside we see the trans tasman and newer markets in asia such as china and india as being very important
6499115 we are in discussions with parties at this stage it would be great if it could be coincidental with the rwc but at the end of the day thats not the fundamental driver
6499116 there was also good growth in retail with the new facilities

6499118 we trust the court can find a way to protect the companies trade secrets without blocking all information on the allegations in this case
6499119 intel has already been fined 25 million in south korea for engaging in this illegal anticompetitive rebate program we would hope evidence related to that illegal behavior and business practice would not be something anyone would want to or could afford to emulate
6499120 the public has a well established right to observe what is going on in our courts whether it is a criminal trial or a business dispute
6499121 each in its own way has an important impact on society and public access promotes confidence that justice is being done fairly
6499122 for example intels response to the plaintiffs amd statement filed on may 15 most parts which allege intels individual behaviors toward the computer manufacturers were redacted even though the events took place so long ago that there is no likely reason that their disclosure could cause competitive damage
6499123 similarly some redactions clearly contain nothing more than lists of third party employees identifying personnel in companies not party to this litigation cannot reasonably be construed to cause competitive injury nor does such information implicate personal privacy interests yet this information has also been redacted from public view
6499124 of course litigants may not seal information merely because public disclosure will be embarrassing or will otherwise reflect poorly on them

6499146 there is a lot of depth here but an olympic final is a funny thing because there is a huge amount pressure it can be really frightening if you let it so well have to see how everyone copes

6499148 haydens had so many setbacks during his career he deserves this break

6499197 where some might find gloom in these anti rockwellian photographs i find a liberation from the glaring rat race of american life in eastmans images a scent hangs in the air like that before a thunderstorm a time when another chapter of life is being closed with the slam of a screen door darkness is falling but a red brick afterglow lingers in eastmans work so you can still marvel at another crumpled calendar page being tossed away
6499198 eastman has brought us back to a place of holy remembrance in vanishing america j hector st john de crevecoeur in letters from an american farmer wrote about pioneers brimming with forlorn hope which is in fact the meaning of the word pioneer in the dutch language i like that phrase somehow eastmans art doesnt leave me depleted or shut down im left with a forlorn hope a recognition that america is a land for transients and the unsettled always has been always will be

6499209 i want to be very clear about this i am not blaming anyone no one is at fault i am even willing to consider the possibility that it wasnt done on purpose but as i delved into chinese for dummies i couldnt help but conclude that the chinese language is the great wall of languages a clever linguistic barrier erected to keep outsiders out what frankly is wrong with esperanto or alphabets i am even dare i say it fairly good at languages typically it takes me no more than few weeks of study until i can more or less function i can get myself from point a to point b i can discern the general drift of a conversation i can sit in a restaurant and feel reasonbly confident that the dish i just ordered wasnt the monkey penis special but as soon became coldly apparent to me there was not a chance that i was going to even manage that in chinese and that worried me

6499269 it could take a couple of hours for our help desk to reproduce an issue from a users description of events
6499270 but it wasnt burdensome until we started planning to extend our web based policy platform externally to brokers then we realized we needed a better way
6499271 we wanted to track activities on knowledge workers desktops and create event logs transparently in the background whether the users were internal or external
6499272 but everything we found was targeted at development troubleshooting with the exception of some emerging companies that we disqualified as too young
6499273 they were using the bmc product but not as extensively as we envisioned
6499274 so we brought in bmc and discovered appsight offered traceability from redmond wash based microsoft windows and java at the front end all the way through back end servers and dropping off into the cobol path
6499275 a windows enabled server was acquired and deployed for the application with recording agents loaded onto each supported application server
6499276 we included about a page of documentation on the new error reporting process
6499277 in short a popup window appears that provides users with directions to follow then the information is automatically e mailed to tech support
6499278 initially we set up the solution aggressively causing event logs to be about 10mb
6499279 users consistently said it was taking too long to release their machines so we fine tuned the number of recorded activities which reduced the logs to about 5mb after about eight months of internal use appsight was included when the new policy platform was released to our brokers
6499280 previously whenever a tester found a bug it required several interactions with a developer to clarify the issue
6499281 now developers can simply play back the recording of the failed test case
6499282 in develpoment the number of tester developer interactions has dropped from an average of three to one
6499283 plus were reducing productivity barriers inherent to working across time zones cultures and languages because developers keep working rather than taking a day or two just to understand a testing issue
6499284 also weve discovered about 25 percent of incidents are actually training issues this eliminates sending out analysts to locate reported system outages at business units only to determine that a new user has failed to click the proper screen tab

6499287 should republicans adopt a party plank at the upcoming national convention to rescind the ban on internet gambling
6499288 go to the republican party s web site and start scrolling through the responses to the platform you will see an army of poker players arguing it is time for republicans to end their opposition to gambling online
6499289 even the most ambitious gamblers know getting republicans to publicly support them is not a safe bet
6499290 the party has been led by social conservatives for 25 years and values voters and religious groups have pushed republicans to take a harder line against gambling as a social ill

6499299 tottenham fans are no exception to any others they support the team and get behind the side

6499321 july saw the highest 12 month increase since march 2003 a climb in gasoline prices was the primary source of higher consumer prices in july
6499322 besides higher prices for gasoline price increases for other energy components such as fuel oil and other fuels and electricity rose sharply in newfoundland and labrador prince edward island and nova scotia in the 12 months to july
6499323 the rise in these energy components largely accounted for the growth in consumer prices posted in these province
6499324 the slowdown in the rise in mortgage interest cost was due more to a softening of new housing prices rather than to lower mortgage interest rates
6499325 while consumers across the country faced higher prices for gasoline and mortgage interest costs lower prices to purchase and lease passenger vehicles helped to offset these price increases
6499326 changes in prices to purchase and lease passenger vehicles ranged from a 7 6 per cent decrease in quebec to an 11 4 per cent decline in new brunswick
6499327 this report offers no big surprises which is a good thing in light of the high side shocks seen in many other cpi releases around the world in recent months
6499328 and while headline inflation is now running at its fastest pace in more than five years it is still near the bottom of the pack globally and more than two points below the current u s pace
6499329 lower gasoline prices suggest that headline inflation will pull up short of the bank of canadas earlier projection of four per cent plus inflation but tough year ago comparisons in the next few months also suggest that a fast retreat in inflation is unlikely

6499379 called lobbyists birds of prey wednesday and vowed to enforce a lifetime ban on lobbying for members of his administration
6499380 the topic of lobbyists is sensitive for mccain because several of his top aides had lucrative lobbying practices
6499381 neither ms iseman nor any representative of paxson and alcalde and fay personally asked senator mccain to send a letter to the fcc regarding this proceeding
6499382 urg ing the commission to abandon plans to close a loophole vitally important to glencairn ltd a client of vicki iseman a lobbyist
6499383 the provision enabled one of the nations largest broadcasting companies sinclair to use a marketing agreement with glencairn a far smaller broadcaster to get around a restriction barring single ownership of two television stations in the same city

6499385 championed legislation that will let an arizona rancher trade remote grassland and ponderosa pine forest here for acres of valuable federally owned property that is ready for development a land swap that now stands to directly benefit one of his top presidential campaign fundraisers
6499386 the bizarre thing to me regarding mccain is we spent a lot of time with his staff and we all seemed to be on the same page about the problems with this swap but somehow john mccain kept pushing it forward
6499387 released an updated list of his top money collectors on tuesday revealing that nearly a fifth of those who have brought in the largest amounts for him more than 500 000 each are lobbyists or work for firms that engage in lobbying

6499392 lobbyists dont come to my office because they know theyre not going to be an earmark they know theyre not going to get a pork barrel project senator obamas gotten lots of em
6499393 i would not allow anyone who worked for my administration to go back to lobbying
6499394 senator obama has asked for nearly a billion dollars in earmarked pork barrel projects and he rails against lobbyists ive never taken a single one
6499395 but the fact is that they are the symptom of a disease
6499396 as long as you have earmarking and pork barrel spending and bridges to nowhere and money for dna of bears in montana and museums and all that then youre going to have lobbyists
6499397 so its kind of entertaining to me to attack the lobbyists rather than the source of the problem which is the earmark theyd all be out of business most of em would be out of business if we stopped pork barrel and earmark spending

6499494 i do not think too many people knew about me laugh we do not get a lot of exposure at bayou that is for sure i had an offer from delta state and a couple junior colleges at ms delta cc and n east cc i decided to come here because coach smither was here he use to baby sit me and my father coached him at delta state we go way back i just pretty much followed him over here
6499495 in high school they used me more as a guard but when i got here they switched me to left tackle i am more natural at pass blocking so that really helped me out a lot
6499496 he practices likes he works in the classroom he just has that drive to be the best he can be heath is very hungry coming from a small school i am from cleveland eastside so i have known heath since he was a baby i think he is a tremendous pass blocker because of his athleticism he can move good for a big guy he played against the top 5 defensive ends in our state last year and only gave up four sacks
6499497 he is pretty strong too heath benches 385 and squats over 550 pounds but the biggest thing he is going to have to work on his run blocking skills we do not run the ball much so we are working on his run blocking skills in practice i line him up at left tackle guard and we even let him snap the ball a lot we just want him to be a well rounded player when he moves on from here i tell you the kid could play any of the positions on the line of scrimmage
6499498 i am trying to get use to it our of high school the biggest offer i had was delta state and now i have all of these schools coming after me it takes a lot to get use to but it is fun all of the mississippi schools are recruiting me illinois oklahoma state kansas state arkansas south florida memphis troy and louisville they are all recruiting me pretty good
6499499 ole miss had a camp over there in july and i stopped by and visited with coaches markuson we had been talking on the phone a lot so i wanted to meet him in person and then i got to meet coach nutt they were all real nice i have not been talking to coach grimes at msu as much as ole miss and usm but we have been talking some and usm they stay in contact with me about as much as ole miss does
6499500 i am going over to ole miss to see them play memphis next weekend coach markuson wants me to watch his linemen i know they are losing their left tackle michael oher this year so i will have a chance to step right in and play if i go to school there

6499502 i found him strang in every way a surprising contrast to my idea of what a british diplomat should be like the son of a farmer and educated at a grammar school and university college london he was entirely free of those mannerisms of speech and behaviour which are acquired at a public school and the older universities he was modest and shy and diffident irked by the grandeur imposed on him by his ambassadorial rank and had a touching faith in my abilities as a soldier to overcome any difficulties which might meet us on our journey
6499503 in a rich green meadow under the shade of a tree on the banks of a smooth and clear stream
6499504 but we were driving towards the ruhr we were soon out of the un ravaged countryside and evidence began to collect of the consequences of war and defeat i began to understand the man who said that war may be hell but defeat is worse for in most of germany at that time and certainly in its industrial areas it seemed true to say that even the most elementary conditions of civilised life had ceased to exist wherever the war had been it had remorselessly ground to pieces the whole structure of organised society and all we could see around us was the ruin and rubble that remained
6499505 like lost travellers painfully exploring some landscape of the moon and all around us at every turn was the same monotonous repetitive vista of gap toothed buildings houses brutally torn apart endless miles of fallen and broken buildings and a few bent and solitary figures scratching in the ruins for anything that might be useful to them in the struggle to survive it was a landscape as mournful and fantastic as those piranesi drew of the ruins of ancient rome in which a few tiny human figures are dwarfed and overshadowed by the colossal fragments of a ruined world
6499506 the streets were totally deserted in this dead city there was nothing any longer to support life neither food nor water nor shelter nor heating and everyone who could leave had already left only the rats still scuffled in the rubble
6499507 we found the local commander at work among a litter of papers in his naked ground floor office from his window he had a view through the rain of the ruins which constituted his empire he was a lieutenant colonel who only a short time ago had commanded a battalion which enthusiastically engaged in completing the final downfall of germany now with equal enthusiasm he was doing what he could to mitigate the effects of her defeat by one of those magical transformations like a scene in a pantomime which occur in war he now found himself the administrator and absolute ruler of an area containing over one million human beings who had suddenly been deprived of the means of existence he might just as well have been dropped from the skies in the middle of tropical africa and told to get on with the job of governing some primitive tribe living on the edge of starvation
6499508 indeed he might have been better off for there at least he would have found some form of tribal organisation through which he could have given his commands
6499509 been swallowed in defeat so far as local administration was concerned the lieutenant colonel might just as well have been operating in the desert and to a more rational man the task in hand would have seemed so grotesque and futile as to be not worth attempting but he was not a rational man particularly because he seemed quite unaware of the irony of his endeavours to succour a people whom a short time ago he had been doing his best to destroy when the political adviser suggested that there might be dangers in adopting so wholeheartedly the cause of our defeated enemies he asked rather angrily whether it was the intention that they should be left to starve or in winter to freeze to death
6499510 but the lieutenant colonel also had another obsession as well as coal without which the germans or what he sometimes referred to as my people would also lack all the other means of subsistence
6499511 for his area like other areas of germany was at that moment overrun by thousands of foreign workers frenchmen poles czechs russians who had been the slaves of the reich and now suddenly released and at liberty were determined both to keep themselves alive and take their revenge by plundering its corpse at night the countryside was alive with bands of what were politely called displaced persons who with considerable reason felt themselves entitled to pillage plunder rape and murder with impunity for what crimes could they possibly commit worse than the crimes which had been committed against them
6499512 simple principle that of all evils the complete absence of any form of law and order is the worst worse even that the lack of the means of subsistence and that his first task was to re establish them
6499513 so he contented himself with saying that he would report the condition of affairs to london and that he thought this might make some difference to those politicians who following in the footsteps of mr morgenthau and mr noel coward still thought that the fundamental problem in german was how to be beastly enough to the germans
6499514 to find our way to the luxuries and comforts of a british corps headquarters where the political adviser was received with the lavish hospitality befitting his rank but so repugnant to his taste the corps commander was giving a very good imitation of a renaissance prince enjoying the pleasures of his latest conquest and was anxious to show that in him the exuberance of victory was refined by the discrimination of taste
6499515 from which all traces of war had been effaced it became almost impossible to believe in the dark picture painted for us in d sseldorf of a population not merely ruined but abandoned and betrayed and a country devastated and denuded and systematically pillaged by bands of brigands who would have been affronted by the mere suggestion that germans could have any rights against themselves indeed we might well have thought the local commander guilty of sentimentality or exaggeration if we had not heard the same account at every post we visited in the course of our journey
6499516 winning the peace the british in occupied germany 1945 1951
6499517 july 20th 1944 marked the final collapse not only of the prussian army but of the whole educational world of the nineteenth century
6499518 it is easy to see that there was a fundamentally false assumption in the idea of conducting a written examination of 131 questions of the conscience of a people and on the basis of the replies calculating the degree of responsibility of each individual it has been easy for salomon to seize upon the na vet and the falsity of the assumptions underlying the fragebogen and by taking that document at its face value to turn the examination into a farce a procedure admirably suited to his literary talents yet the english reader should not be deceived into taking der fragebogen at its face value he should remember firstly that he is in the hands of a very gifted writer
6499519 the truth is that for a person of salomons past and beliefs to dissociate himself as he does in this book from all responsibility for the triumph and the crimes of national socialism is a piece of effrontery which only so brilliant a writer could have attempted with success
6499520 since its publication in 1951 over 250 000 germans have bought der fragebogen despite the fact that some of germanys most distinguished critics have condemned it violently both on political and moral grounds it is difficult not to sympathise with such critics they represent that class of humane and liberal germans who still dare to believe even after the disasters of the last fifty years that germany may yet redeem the errors of the past
6499521 one of the greatest gifts oxford had to bestow and a sure guarantee of success in whatever career one chose to adopt when i was elected the college included among its forty members one archbishop one bishop and ex viceroy of india several cabinet ministers the two brightest luminaries of the english bar and the editor of the times
6499522 for i was quite certain that i had no character of my own good or bad that i existed only in the particular circumstances of the moment and since circumstances were always changing so fast so bewilderingly so absorbingly how could it not follow that i must change with them
6499523 covered all but the last four months of what has come to be known conventionally as the adenauer era
6499524 one must never forget that between bonn and paris lie the gigantic graveyards of verdun referring to the battles of the first world war and that it required a common and continuous effort of the good will of all at last to put an end to one of the most tragic chapters in the history of europe and to begin a new one
6499525 the americans with whom i dealt were all intelligent and reasonable men we soon understood each other
6499526 i want to take this opportunity to thank president hoover on behalf of all germans and to express my admiration to him for this report on the situation of the defeated and ostracized germany the report is a great humanitarian document it must have been the first time in the history of the last few centuries that a humanitarian spirit animated the victor and that the victor desired to help the vanquished to emerge from their misery
6499527 no one who was not living in germany at that time can imagine what this relief coming from private or church sources meant to hungry and defeated germans the arrival of a care parcel made any day into a feast day for a family
6499528 i must here pause to say that to my great regret sir brian robertson was no longer british high commissioner he had been in germany for nearly five years he had come at a time when we germans were in an extremely difficult situation by his personality the honesty of his convictions his humanity and sincerity he had made a tremendous contribution to changes which none of us would have dreamed of in 1946 or 1947
6499529 my relations with the officers of the american forces were as i have said very good things changed when after a while on 21 june 1945 the americans left cologne and were replaced by british troops conflicts soon arose between me and the british administrative officers in my opinion the british were treating the population very badly their attitude to me was very negative
6499530 the british and other occupying powers were not equal in practice to the extraordinary tasks involved in administering a destroyed country
6499531 on the orders of the british military government men from all parts of the british zone were forced to work in the mines this proved completely futile also miners were given special food rations which they were supposed to eat alone away from their families it is easy to imagine the psychological consequences the miner was expected to eat his fill at his place of work while his wife and children went hungry at home
6499532 in the face of the new european possibilities great britain assumed an attitude of hesitation irresolution and indecision
6499533 naturally it is adenauers relations with the british which have principally interested me the question will always be asked whether he found us fundamentally unsympathetic from the start whether he was permanently alienated by brigadier barraclough the senior british officer in cologne when dismissed from his post of mayor of cologne or whether as i believe and i saw him repeatedly over the whole period of his chancellorship he only settled into petrified hostility to us when he had lost his touch and was blindly trailing de gaulle
6499534 considerably in his adenauers confidence because he was a friend of my father in law who was military governor of cologne after the first world war
6499535 surrounded by the chaos which i have described cologne after the war here we had the senior paid official with his head well in the clouds
6499536 was not satisfied with the progress which has been made in cologne in connection with the repair of buildings and the clearance of the streets and the general task of preparing for the coming winter
6499537 sir christopher steel compared templers part in the affair with a stray remark of king henry ii of england which resulted in the murder of thomas abecket
6499538 the british commander in chief and military governor air marshal sir sholto douglas arrived amid a roll of drums and a blare of trumpets
6499539 douglas asked me about my political career to date i said in 1917 i became oberb rgermeister of cologne in 1933 i was removed by the national socialists because of political unreliability in march 1945 i was reinstated by the americans and in october of the same year dismissed by the british for incompetence that is why i am now on the zonal advisory council douglas looked rather surprised and walked on without saying a word
6499540 believed that he adenauer regarded his dismissal as an affront and that it left a mental scar which never entirely healed

6499561 few people in the history of the national football league have played the game as well as gene and then had another career in football with so much positive impact on the structure and competitiveness of the entire league as gene
6499562 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6499563 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field
6499564 he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6499565 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6499566 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children
6499567 i didnt know gene personally i just knew him professionally
6499568 im not going to sell the players on a cap again
6499569 once we go through the cap why should we agree to it again
6499570 gene and i developed a close friendship that remained strong through the good times and some of the nfls most difficult challenges
6499571 we worked very closely on key issues that allowed the nfl to maintain unprecedented labour peace
6499572 his biggest asset was his understanding of the business of the game and you always knew that his concern for the games best interests guided his actions
6499573 gene was a true pioneer as one of the few african american leaders of a major union
6499574 he was the equal of owners in negotiations and made the league a better place for all players

6499593 i think we have over the last few weeks as well kyle has been rock solid all year so you know those three are the obvious ones but when you get in to the chase and that points margin closes up there are going to be some other guys we will need to think about and worry about as well we are just going to keep doing our jobs and give 100 percent and hopefully get the job done
6499594 i would like to be in kyles position where on a bad day you are running second
6499595 that is really where we want to be and what we did through the chase last year i mean on a bad day we were in or near the top five and it paid off we are a little behind this year at this point we have worked real hard to close the gap and i think we are on to the right things and will continue to close the gap we have a lot of testing ahead of us and certainly working on stuff we are doing all we can and hopefully we get in the chase and some things come our way and we get some stuff ironed out

6499610 en junio la inflaci n fue de 0 77 pero la inflaci n de alimentos ha sido 0 48 podemos comprobar que el efecto de los alimentos sobre la inflaci n es de 62 y ac sufren los que menos tienen

6499701 theres nothing wrong with talking to your children about whats happening in the economy and how it is affecting the household budget so that they can actually see and feel exactly whats happening to the family so theyll feel less likely to want that expensive ipod or some other product like that
6499702 the trick is to communicate really clearly with children about economic limitations and also to reassure children about kind of the future
6499703 because children get very concerned that things are unpredictable now and money is short and there is a lot of nervousness they also key into the parents own anxiety
6499704 you should have an essential list of items that you need to buy so that when youre out there in the stores youre not actually making those emotional purchases
6499705 i love the customers and its a lot of fun
6499706 makes me think of people spending too much money money they dont have
6499707 i know its not true i looked at his call log im kidding
6499708 the record i thought would be around till i die has just been broken
6499709 for him to have been chosen to officiate such an important match means that he must be very good so i believe he will help both sides play a clean game
6499710 it will be a shame if such a big match is decided by a controversial incident we have some great players and argentina also have great players too so everybody should come out and play football and not try to con the referee into giving funny decisions
6499711 kanu called and congratulated us and also wished us good luck in the final against argentina
6499712 the manager said i must stay back and train to get my fitness back but my spirit is with them and i will pray hard for us to win the gold medal
6499713 it is one of the changes and you may have noticed it at euro 2008 where yellow cards after the quarterfinals are also wiped out like the group stages
6499714 so if the player got a yellow card in the semifinal it is not a problem he can still play in the final
6499715 if its my fate to die by an assassins bullet so be it
6499716 i have returned on my free will to join the ranks of those struggling to restore our rights and freedoms through nonviolence
6499717 how shall freedom be defended by arms when it is attacked by arms by truth when it is attacked by lies by democratic faith when it is attacked by authoritarian dogma always and in the final act by determination and faith
6499718 i was very nervous especially since i was competing with the best in the world in the likes of american athlete sanya richards and great britains christine ohuruogu
6499719 i was disappointed with getting that lane because it is very difficult to compete in it
6499720 it is only that there was too much expectations from her and therefore the pressure became too much for her
6499721 we told her that since expectations are very high she must just go there and do the country proud and the only setback was that she was very nervous
6499722 i am very proud of them gable garenamotse was a finalist in the long jump and though kabelo kgosiemang did not do as expected it is only fair to note that the olympics are very tough and the exposure that comes with competing at these games is very important
6499723 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 meters
6499724 how many beers does it take before you would sleep with jessica simpson
6499725 the church is not a business not an experiment not a product to be sold it is an outpost of the kingdom a sign of things to come in christs sovereign rule which is now hidden but will be made open and public then all the world will bow before him in recognition of who he is
6499726 all the categories of biblical theology must be kept in mind simultaneously to inform the christian worldview
6499727 je suis combl par ce que je viens de voir au stadium iba mar diop je dois reconna tre quil ne pouvait en tre quainsi et je peux dores et d j confirmer que dakar a d sormais son tournoi qui sera un classique limage de ceux du niger et du nig ria jexprime toute ma gratitude au peuple s n galais et rends hommage au cng de lutte pr sid par le dr alioune sarr a voir cette jeunesse tr s dynamique qui pendant 72 heures ne sest pas m nag e pour mener son quipe la victoire je peux dire que le choix a t judicieux rendez vous donc lann e prochaine pour le second tournoi de lutte africaine de dakar

6499730 at the meeting a trustee asked if selling some of windermeres property was an active consideration mallory responded that property would not be sold because to do so would disrupt development plans
6499731 windermere baptist conference center will sell some property as part of its long range strategic plan
6499732 the person being disciplined almost immediately in the process admitted that he had failed to live by the teachings of the covenant that he had signed
6499733 he knew that he had violated the promise the commitment that he had made to the body sadly he was put out of the body we still pray for him
6499734 the real issue is not having a covenant but the real issue is using a covenant
6499735 and you will use a covenant either more or less depending on your seriousness about regenerate church membership
6499736 the idea of a covenant is very much a part of what were talking about
6499737 churches if they want to be healthy there has to be a standard there has to be a sense of this is who we are an identification if you want to identify as a part of the body of christ then there are some expectations
6499738 i find people everywhere who are discouraged about business as usual and actually the seeker sensitive stuff has become business as usual
6499739 its not producing a really healthy church in many cases its not healthy because its mainly filled with non believers so i think the first issue of health is to deal with who are the believers and try to have a regenerate church membership
6499740 weve got to be able to walk that tightrope and allow the holy spirit to lead us in this
6499741 weve got to have standards weve got to have expectations
6499742 wise pastors in those countries are unhappy with western methods that are coming over
6499743 were transporting all this methodology that weve had thats really produced a very unhealthy church
6499744 church is the one place where we expect the least out of people and you get what you expect a lot of times
6499745 thats why we are dealing with over half of our folks not even showing up on sunday morning and thats a base measurement of whether they are committed or not
6499746 according to the needs of the hour according to the conflicts we face
6499747 it fits with james when he talks about if youre a christian your life should measure up in certain ways
6499748 its hard to measure love and yet paul puts love at the top of the list every time in each of the new testament books
6499749 he keeps coming back to this issue of love being the supreme thing so really in gods mind what is a great church a great church is a church that loves
6499750 this morning july 22 i was with these men and they were all saying ive never been in a church like this where people loved each other like this where you have such a unity in the body thats not measurable on a piece of paper but it certainly is known by the people who are experiencing it
6499751 theres something very valuable about the process of coming up with a church covenant that drives it home to the people
6499752 i would suggest that pastors and some key people come together intentionally to study the whole issue of what needs to be put in a church covenant by reviewing many church covenants and weighing what they believe is best
6499753 it brings together then the true members at least purifies the church considerably
6499754 quit being pragmatic and look at what god requires the church to be
6499755 god might call a church healthy but some church growth specialist might not
6499756 were really doing a very big disservice to people who are not believers to keep them on our rolls its not loving and its almost aiding and abetting their sin
6499757 weve focused more on the external than helping people truly become transformed
6499758 being with these young people is so refreshing because you can see in them that they are truly excited about christianity and are really striving to live humble and broken lives in the lord
6499759 they made a group on facebook where they have been able to talk and stay in touch since last year
6499760 because of that the students have made lasting friendships that didnt end when the tour was over and everybody seemed excited about going on the tour again
6499761 to be perfectly honest there is not one dud in the group
6499762 from what ive seen every one of the choir members have great voices that they consciously use every night to honor god
6499763 in our devotional time we talk about worship and how its done in the bible
6499764 we have also heard a lot about our attitudes for worship and how it directly influences our personal worship as well as others worship especially if were leading them
6499765 memorization is important because if you mumble a lot up there or youre not confident in what youre singing the audience is going to pick up on it and it wont be as effective
6499766 yes we ask them to memorize the material so they can better engage their audience
6499767 they need to have that eye contact to make it a real spiritual experience actually an almost physical one its necessary to take down those walls and let worship really take place
6499768 we want to come away knowing that both our audience and our performers received a real taste of worship
6499769 its so great to get to know and become close with the other choir members the adult leaders and even with our nightly host home families
6499770 but at the same time its really hard to say good bye when its over you get so close in that weeks time i know ill just be bawling
6499771 its important to take god seriously and not take yourself too seriously
6499772 most people dont include the lord in their life all the world was in business before i showed up and will still be functioning long after im gone
6499773 i think it makes it easier i dont have to wake up every morning and wonder what im going to believe today it releases you from tension and struggle
6499774 the most important issue facing america is how we treat each other and our respect for the sanctity of life
6499775 it took women 150 years to get the right to vote it took people of color 200 years to come to a place of acceptance
6499776 i am convinced with all my heart that god almighty gave us this land and capacity to survive because we had elevated human life what a magnificent elevation and celebration of the human spirit
6499777 we believe in no soldier left behind we risk able bodied men and thousands of dollars of equipment to rescue a wounded soldier his value is not in his function but in his person
6499778 its not causing people to be angry its causing people to think it is this type of approach that is reducing the number of abortions in cities where vitae is advertising
6499779 it is saving human life it is elevating human life
6499780 if you believe that your own life has value how can you devalue another person
6499781 i wont rule out making another race sometime right now im focusing on helping senator john mccain get elected
6499782 i dont think senator lieberman would be a good choice republicans want a republican i dont know that he would be a good fit to be vice president
6499783 its got to be somebody hes comfortable with somebody to help him get his message out hes pro life he does support traditional marriage and the sanctity of human life his opponent does not
6499784 how wonderful people are i came away encouraged by what i saw in people
6499785 running for president wasnt nearly as brutal or savage as anything i ran for in arkansas
6499786 consider the nations of the pacific rim consider the sweatshops of developing countries where countless thousands suffer under the oppressive yoke of forced labor and little pay fueled by american greed and materialism
6499787 prevents christians from performing their gospel requirements of feeding the hungry clothing the naked and visiting the sick
6499788 understands religion can play a significant role in the life of people in cuban society and even in helping international relations
6499789 during this time its going to be hard to believe i have had over 1 000 meetings with people all around the world on this subject of our broadening our commitment to global evangelical relationships
6499790 i am more thrilled to say to you today that all around the world there is appreciation and thanksgiving for your initiative as southern baptists to expand our relationships in fact not only is it overwhelmingly appreciated it is clearly said they believe it is extremely timely that we have moved to this place
6499791 theres no secret you just press the accelerator to the floor and steer left
6499792 according to their ability yes and beyond their ability they were freely willing and not only as we had hoped but they first gave themselves to the lord
6499793 god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life
6499794 just press the accelerator to the floor and steer left
6499795 sometimes people want to believe that an african american woman is not concerned about business
6499796 i wouldnt be a great african american woman doing my job if i wasnt but im also concerned about business because if business does well in northeast ohio my constituents do well
6499797 dont worry when youre 50 years old you wont even remember this market swoon
6499798 its about loving your neighbor like the good samaritan did in the story the good neighbor is the one showing mercy and our prayer our goal is to be a church who is willing to show love and mercy with no ulterior motives
6499799 but mainly we see it as an opportunity to help parents be real heroes to their kids
6499800 the parents are the ones who decide to bring them here to get them all their necessary school supplies
6499801 i think when people think of branson they think of the glitz and the shows and the brand new beautiful branson landing
6499802 they are surprised to find out that there is actually a high percentage of homelessness in branson its expensive to live here
6499803 what was great was that kits for kidz sent us example kits and backpacks that we were then able to present to potential sponsors so they knew exactly what they were buying when they donated
6499804 we used to do a block party where we had 300 400 and eventually 500 people come out and enjoy our free entertainment and activities in the church parking lot
6499805 but for those who are lost or dont have a church home the church parking lot is not considered a safe place to be its about as uncomfortable for them as it would be for a christian to go to a bar it made sense to move the bash to a more neutral site
6499806 we also had about 25 people trained in the sharing jesus without fear study
6499807 their whole purpose at the bash was to go out and start conversations and interact with the people who come we came out earlier and prayed over the field and our desire for the spirit to move in this place we have been intentional in that way
6499808 events like these help us grow closer as a church and help us to come together while we are also helping others
6499809 we just want to love people to christ and then help them grow in that love
6499810 ah one of lawrence sanders archy mcnally books i havent read
6499811 morgans 25th century earth is convincing while the questions he poses about how much self is tied to body chemistry and how the rich believe themselves above the law are especially timely

6499820 over the course of many years with many ups and many downs stephanie was right by our side unwavering indefatigable
6499821 it was that fighting spirit that allowed stephanie to rise from modest beginnings to succeed in public service to become a one woman force for progress in our country
6499822 it wasnt enough for her just to break barriers in her own life she was also determined to bring opportunity to all those who had been overlooked and left behind and in stephanie they had a fearless friend and unyielding advocate

6499835 it is not often a player leaves one big club to go to another like arsenal or liverpool it does not tend to happen
6499836 but mikael did not play much last year and i think he just wanted to go somewhere where he would so in that sense i am happy for him
6499837 he has been here a long time and he still deserves to play at the highest level
6499838 mikael has given so much to this club i am just surprised he is going to arsenal but he has made the choice
6499839 after 18 years of the peoples national party pnp it was thought that the jlp would revolutionise the governance of jamaica galvanise the populace and take measures that would spur economic growth
6499840 instead the country is worse off than it was a year ago inflation is at about 25 per cent crime is at an all time high poverty levels are on the increase and there is no discernible energy plan to combat rising oil prices
6499841 after 18 long years in the opposition the now ruling jlp and the new prime minister bruce golding are finding it more challenging to govern than they might have expected
6499842 the new government has made little progress on its election pledges to tackle rising crime
6499843 after 18 years of pnp rule during which the crime problem worsened steadily it will prove difficult for the golding government to make quick progress particularly since confidence in the security forces and the criminal justice system is at an all time low as a result the issue is likely to dog the jlp to the same extent that it troubled its predecessor
6499844 since the 1980s the government has undertaken the responsibility of limiting the states role in the economy promoting the development of export driven production reducing the fiscal and current account deficit as well as eliminating poverty and inequality thus far these objectives mostly have been met with limited success the debt situation is alarming and continues to hamper economic growth by drawing heavily upon resources that could be put to more productive uses
6499845 when it was in opposition the jlp was critical of the pnp governments decision to sign onto the petro caribe deal which has proven to be a panacea for many caribbean governments faced with crippling energy bills faced with very few options chavezs largesse has proven to be a godsend to this administration not just in terms of oil but also in financial assistance for the port authority and a boon to the agricultural sector chavezs munificence though welcomed is not the answer for the jlp
6499846 on the economic front the governments biggest problem is the spike in inflation the result of the lingering effects on domestic food production of hurricane damage in 2007 and sharply rising global oil and food prices
6499847 the government has introduced temporary subsidies on a number of basic food items to help soften the impact of global food price increases but the food segment of the consumer price index still rose by 2 6 per cent in may food carries a heavy weighting in the cpi accounting for around 40 per cent of the basket of goods used to compile the index
6499848 the new government ran on an anti crime platform and will be under pressure to produce results
6499849 the fiscal deficit will narrow only gradually as weak growth prospects constrain revenue growth expenditure is moreover vulnerable to higher than budgeted interest payments or wages hurricane dean dampened gdp growth in 2007 but there is unlikely to be a strong rebound in 2008 as a recovery in export volumes is hampered by weakening us demand and domestic monetary tightening inflation has been driven up by the effect of hurricane dean and by high imported food and fuel prices inflation will remain in double digits throughout 2008 but a disinflationary trend should hold towards year end the current account deficit will remain extremely large in the forecast period as high oil prices continue to put pressure on the import bill
6499850 the jamaican economy suffers from serious debt high inflation and uneven growth rates current economic policies such as exchange rate devaluation and debt servicing only exacerbate jamaicas economic downslide
6499851 to resolve this crisis the government must implement measures aimed at sustainable growth such as improving the quality of education and facilitating credit access for small borrowers ultimately jamaica may be forced to walk the argentine road of debt renunciation in order to keep from going under
6499852 with the external environment deteriorating jamaicas persistent fiscal and current account deficits showing no signs of narrowing and inflation accelerating sharply the new government has entered office at a tricky time in terms of economic management it will have little room for policy manoeuvre and its electoral promise to speed up jamaicas languid economic growth will also likely be extremely difficult to achieve

6499910 israeli policies are designed to limit the number of palestinians living in areas earmarked for settlements or in their vicinity
6499911 the israeli authorities have for many years applied a discriminatory policy of house demolitions permitting on the one hand many tens of israeli settlements to be built on occupied palestinian territory in flagrant violation of international law at the same time as they confiscate palestinian lands forbidding the palestinian population to build and destroying their houses the cleared land is often used to build illegal israeli settlements international law prohibits occupying powers from building settlements for their own citizens on the territories they occupy

6499930 inzwischen kann sich bereits mehr als jeder vierte bundesb rger vorstellen sich von bankberatern oder selbst ndigen finanzberatern kostenpflichtig zu den themen verm gensbildung finanzierung oder altersvorsorge beraten zu lassen
6499931 f r uns ist das eine gro e best tigung unserer t glichen arbeit denn seit fast zwei jahren sind wir als einer der ersten reinen honorarberater in deutschland berhaupt t tig wir kennen das beratungsgesch ft auf honorarbasis von der pieke auf und wissen um dessen gro e vorz ge gegen ber der eben nur vermeintlich kostenlosen beratung bei den etablierten anbietern oder vermittlern
6499932 zu beginn war es durchaus ein gutes st ck arbeit die kunden von den erheblichen vorteilen unseres neuen beratungsmodells zu begeistern
6499933 inzwischen zeigen unser erfolgreiches empfehlungsmanagement und die stark steigenden kundenzahlen aber dass wir auf bestem wege sind auch und gerade f r unsere kunden
6499934 lediglich 16 prozent der bundesb rger kennen derzeit berhaupt einen verm gensberater der honorarberatung auch tats chlich anbietet das wollen wir nat rlich rasch ndern
6499935 gerade f r die versicherungsberatung auf honorarbasis sehen wir enormes wachstumspotenzial
6499936 erst seit gut einem jahr kann der kunde bei den beratern f r versicherungen zwei gruppen unterscheiden einerseits die unabh ngigen versicherungsberater die ausschlie lich auf honorarbasis arbeiten also direkt vom kunden bezahlt werden und andererseits versicherungsvertreter versicherungsvermittler oder unabh ngige versicherungsmakler die allesamt ihre provision oder maklergeb hr von der versicherungsgesellschaft erhalten bei ihnen ist zwar die beratung zun chst kostenlos aber ihre honorare sind in die beitr ge eingerechnet und orientieren sich auch an der tats chlichen vertragslaufzeit
6499937 unsere beratung ist objektiv neutral und tats chlich unabh ngig da uns mit der zulassung gesetzlich verboten ist provisionen courtagen oder sonstige zuwendungen jedweder art von den versicherungsgesellschaften anzunehmen
6499938 dieses alleinstellungsmerkmal zu fast allen anderen am markt t tigen versicherungsexperten sichert unseren kunden die besten und vor allem g nstigsten angebote und ergebnisse
6499939 viele kunden wenden sich an uns um ihren bestehenden versicherungsschutz einmal kritisch berpr fen zu lassen als versicherungsberater liegt unsere besondere st rke dann darin unn tige versicherungen unverh ltnism ige versicherungssummen etwaige doppelversicherungen und vor allem von den konditionen her unattraktive versicherungen zu erkennen und zu eliminieren
6499940 denn eingepreiste provisionen und bestandsverg tungen durch die neuen transparenzvorschriften seit 1 juli 2008 eindeutig identifizierbar gehen zu lasten der versicherungsleistung und damit dem kunden selbst verloren
6499941 ein ehepaar legte uns zum beispiel versicherungen mit jahresgesamtbeitr gen von 7 300 euro zur pr fung vor unter beseitigung zweier doppelversicherungen und der nutzung alternativer versicherungstarife konnten wir eine beitragsersparnis von rund 2 200 euro erreichen
6499942 hier k nnen wir mit den noch ganz neuen honorar und nettotarifen der etablierten versicherungsgesellschaften aus denen s mtliche vermittlungsprovisionen herausgerechnet sind beste angebote unterbreiten erst vor kurzem haben wir f r einen berufsanf nger beim abschluss einer berufsunf higkeitsversicherung monatsbeitrag rund 100 euro 40 jahre laufzeit eine tats chliche kostenersparnis bereits unter voller ber cksichtigung unseres honorars in h he von rund 2 500 euro realisiert
6499943 das modell der honorarberatung ist angesichts des hohen beratungsbedarfs gerade bei komplexeren finanzthemen wie etwa der altersvorsorge grunds tzlich ein sinnvoller fairer und zukunftsorientierter ansatz die besten erfolgschancen als finanzdienstleister hat wer sich fr hzeitig berzeugend positioniert und die kundenw nsche bei der ausgestaltung und der kundenansprache systematisch ber cksichtigt
6499944 und genau hierf r stehen wir mit unserer beratung und mit unserem beratungsmodell

6499950 hola ante todo deciros que disfruto con este blog me parece una
6499951 la crisis de spanair desemboca en una tragedia de 153 muertos
6499952 at the start everybody thought yeah that sounds cool but its not going to work
6499953 a lot of other people have tried it and failed and this is why we think weve got something really innovative because weve overcome all these hurdles and got something that really works now we believe weve got freedom of movement that you havent seen in this genre of game before its more like what prince of persia has done but in firstperson
6499954 theres always been a lot of focus on the gun in firstperson games
6499955 no one puts that much focus on the movement how you move around the environment we wanted to capture a real sense of physicality games like unreal tournament have movement double jumps rocket jumps but its very abstracted we wanted to place you in the world and convey the strain and physical contact with the environment
6499956 the aspirations of that are that you have a body that the camera movement is organic and it should feel like its really you it should feel fluid and realistic we wanted to work not on creating bigger and better and more intricate weapons but on really bringing in the hands of the person
6499957 what you usually see when you look at the hands in firstperson shooters is that you have a big loss of volume when it comes to the lower arms the knuckles disappearing and so on
6499958 i would say most of the firstperson shooters just ignore the hands and focus a whole lot on the weapons we have projects at dice where we have lead weapon artists and a crew under him or her to develop the shaders for the weapons but then you have these low polygon cubic hands holding the weapons we focused on the hands from the start so we have no loss of volume we have veins showing and knuckles that grow depending on how the hand is bent in a normal firstperson game you have about 30 animations for the hands right now i think were up to 300
6499959 were not positioning this as a shooter the focus isnt on the gun its on the person as the marketing is saying its putting the person back into firstperson so its all about you its about the movement
6499960 we believe weve got freedom of movement that you havent seen in this genre of game before
6499961 the first thing we wanted to get was the feeling of actually sprinting to get a feeling of speed and momentum in the game
6499962 a lot of the moves you do are parkour moves
6499963 we decided fairly early on in development that we wanted to do a game that was based in an urban environment positioning it away from military and war and the big open spaces of battlefield we started off prototyping in battlefield 2 and we found that one of the things we wanted to do we couldnt which was to move around the city on foot we found that vehicles were quickly abandoned in the narrow city streets people drove them for ten yards jumped out of them again and ducked down an alley or ran up stairs or ran into the subways weve got a very vertical world and found that people wanted to move around that quickly on foot
6499964 but when you play this game for a while it changes the way you look at levels in other firstperson games you stop seeing obstacles and start seeing opportunities i could wall run up there and jump there and do this and that even on a very small rooftop everyone approaches it differently
6499965 but you want to maintain a flow thats where the skill element is introduced coming to the bottom of the zip line you want to time your landing properly so you can continue to maintain that speed and carry on moving whereas if you fail you may stumble slow down or even fall over
6499966 when you play this game it changes the way you look at other firstperson games you stop seeing obstacles and start seeing opportunities
6499967 aside from just considering how this was all possible technically
6499968 we spent a lot of time thinking about what youd be doing with the controller we want to keep control of movement off the face buttons because the second you use a face button you move your thumb off the analogue stick and you lose control of your aiming
6499969 your enemies are powerful and heavily armoured theyre dangerous your pistol isnt going to do much damage to them so what we wanted to do is to infuse movement into the combat firstly in avoiding your enemies the more acrobatically you navigate the world the harder a target you become
6499970 alternatively you can get in close to them and turn their own weapons against them snatching a weapon from them and using this more powerful gun to dispatch the harder enemies we look at these larger weapons as temporary power ups because once you take them youre limiting your mobility but increasing your power its an interesting trade off you cant carry around an enormous assault rifle while youre doing these athletic stunts
6499971 one of the conventions we were interested in breaking was never putting enemies behind you
6499972 other firstperson games often have you moving towards your enemy and clearing the threat we wanted to give this idea of chase the enemies arent there for cannon fodder theyre frightening and powerful
6499973 youre outnumbered theres no doubt that you need to be running
6499974 your character faith has a jason bourne sense of potential escape routes
6499975 we wanted to get that feel into the game seeing the world as a she would see it stripping out everything except that which would be important to her we want the player to move through the world very quickly and we want the player to know what their options are all the things that are important to you will pop out
6499976 i dont want to say that youre a whore but right now your actions and your attitude are very whoreish

6499982 hospice has always placed importance on the spiritual needs of the patients and families they serve and spiritual care is an integral component of the hospice philosophy of care
6499983 a shared concern for spiritual care creates a natural connection among hospices coalitions and faith communities and a common ground for education dialogue and partnership
6499984 these resources from caring connections will help providers respond more effectively to patients and families coping with the serious illness or death of a loved one
