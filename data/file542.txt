5420003 we undertook this research to determine what we could do to change writing achievement and writing instruction in this country
5420004 weve identified 11 strategies as being effective at teaching students how to write and improve their achievement
5420005 writing next effective strategies to improve writing of adolescents in middle and high school
5420006 reading next a vision for action and research in middle and high school literacy
5420007 we have to widen the literacy spotlight to include writing as well as reading increasing students writing abilities increases their literacy abilities which in turn increases the likelihood that they will stay in school and graduate and that means they have a much better chance for future success

5420034 people talk about me and theres nothing i can do about it
5420035 what exactly did that customer rep person right down yesterday when i explained why i was disconnecting these services
5420036 student success is a term you see a lot in the literature i counted thousands of references to it in peer reviewed papers over the past 10 years but it is something that has really defied description
5420037 one of the big conclusions that came out of this delineation is that student success is much more complex than just year to year perseverance or graduation rates
5420038 the first area academic attainment or graduation is the portal to the rest of the measures of success
5420039 if you dont persist and you dont graduate you arent as likely to experience these other benefits you are more likely to see the maximum return on your education if you graduate and persist year to year
5420040 six of the eight domains depend primarily on student course learning this is where faculty come in individual faculty members play a direct and highly significant role in fostering student success
5420041 this is particularly important in aspects of teaching that are distinct from lecturing faculty must be motivated to make professional choices to use pedagogically based tools methods and approaches with their students that go beyond lecturing and these all require effort commitment and focus
5420042 state policymakers can help ensure that faculty are making the professional choices needed to best serve students by having clear performance expectations
5420043 some tools to do this include funding policies linked to student performance state funded faculty development seminars and workshops academic program reviews and more
5420044 libraries nationwide are interested in supporting faculty who can realize the benefits of publishing open access journals
5420045 at iu were especially pleased to help advance one of the universitys top disciplines by partnering locally we are truly helping to disseminate scholarship that will help researchers worldwide
5420046 the costs associated with publishing in the traditional mode are astronomical
5420047 publication of a single research article in museum anthropology can cost thousands of dollars and when published the results will then be available to a small proportion of people worldwide
5420048 if for instance a scholar spends months documenting the work of an elderly woodcarver living in a small american town and then writes about what she learned in a peer reviewed research article i have an obligation as her editor to make it as easy as possible for the schoolchildren of that town or the artists grandchildren to gain access to her writing open access repositories and journals in their varied forms help make this possible

5420069 is ie going to auto update to ie7 and how do you feel about that
5420070 we hear about firefox and opera 9 and decided to wait and steal their good ideas just like we did when we made our first release of dos

5420072 after the 3 4 service packs well wait to see what firefox and opera do then well let you know
5420073 is ie going to auto update to ie7 i think that the first thing really is that we cant really force it on users i do believe that we will offer it through windows update but it wont be an automatic silent update certainly it wont be like you come in one day and suddenly your computers running ie7 rather than ie6 certainly we have to ask the user if they really want it

5420085 if the regulations are that vague that a sophisticated irb could differ from ohrp and the agency after the fact could hold you to their interpretation it suggests the oversight of these issues need to be reconsidered
5420086 in a telling example of how confusing the regulations are
5420087 theres been an awful lot of quality improvement that has been stalled or put on hold trying to understand this irb issue
5420088 the chill sent through the quality improvement field has been very very real
5420089 no one paid too much attention to what we were recommending
5420090 there is agreement between the quality improvement people and the federal regulators that not all qi is research and if its not research theres no reason the federal government should be overseeing it
5420091 the ethics of using quality improvement methods in health care
5420092 for algorithms to be useful decision points need to be straightforward
5420093 those projects that have a more rigorous evaluation or a faculty member who might want to do something scholarly would be submitted to the irb for review
5420094 theres nothing worse than having regulations that are so unclear that people break them unknowingly it creates a chilling environment and thats especially not an environment you want in the quality arena you want people to measure the whole point
5420095 its not justifiable to do any kind of work that will be futile
5420096 its not fair to patients its not fair to staff
5420097 it is important to have this supervision embedded in the people who understand how the organization works otherwise you wont understand which projects are dangerous and which arent
5420098 what looks like an innocuous change could have serious consequences
5420099 it was assumed that normal health care was the best it could be and any kind of research put you at risk
5420100 now we know thats not true normal everyday health care is not safe for patients
5420101 the challenge is to find oversight that is commensurate with the risk that doesnt stall things that allows learning and improvement and yet protects subjects from undue risk
5420102 i dont see us linking the research community with the clinical community and thats sorely needed
5420103 when i look at the advances in biomedical science in the last decade and the limited advances in quality its sobering in part i think our failure to progress is our lack of viewing quality improvement as science
5420104 forty years of research has shown that the idea of a physician as a standalone expert ethically founded does not guarantee best care to a patient
5420105 it is not a question of whether we are going to oversee the ethics of it but how we oversee it
5420106 activities based on existing knowledge about the enduring nature and function of people and their environment rather than to develop new knowledge
5420107 you have to be very clear up front whether you are considering a project research and apply the appropriate criteria
5420108 doesnt mean that it can be done sloppily or without attention to ethical issues
5420109 our irb would look at these and say this isnt research
5420110 a systematic investigation designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge
5420111 systematic data guided activities designed to bring about immediate improvements in health care delivery in particular settings
5420112 given these results it is time to take the next step and implement hospital value based purchasing for the medicare program so that citizens across the nation can benefit from improved safety and quality and get the right care every time
5420113 further knowledge of the basic components effectiveness cost effectiveness and success factors is crucial to determine the value of quality improvement collaboratives
5420114 have improved care and saved many lives at participating hospitals
5420115 can have a robust impact in quality of care for americans seen in primary care practices
5420116 they score but do not support physician work and therefore are perceived by physicians as disempowering
5420117 a fter adjustment for severity of illness and propensity score hospital mortality rates were higher for patients who received ccm than for those who did not
5420118 a necessary complement to comparative clinical effectiveness information for all health care stakeholders
5420119 it is vitally important to keep comparative clinical effectiveness analysis and cost effectiveness analysis separate from each other
5420120 nurses have long served as the last line of defense against medication errors
5420121 the health care system must wait no longer to provide them and all patients with the systematic safety net that they deserve
5420122 n onpayment for complications that are truly not preventable may destroy trust in quality improvement programs reduce access for patients at risk for these complications e g obese patients at increased risk for decubitus ulcers deep venous thrombosis and infections may be shunned reduce the frequency of diagnosis after admission and misinform the public when safety and quality results are publicly reported

5420175 a wide variety of body types are normal depending on ones bone structure metabolism and genetics it is fruitless and misleading to expect everyone to conform to the same weight whether you are naturally muscular chunky twiggy curvy or tiny trying to change your body can be frustrating and even dangerous
5420176 what a paradox that dieting should be such a lucrative industry in a country with such high obesity rates someone is obviously profiting from fat phobia in a big way take a nation of insecure people bombard them with images of impossible beauty standards and they will greet the latest fad with open wallets couldnt those billions of dollars be better spent instead of trying to buy happiness think of all the good that money could do if diverted to cancer research or stamping out hunger
5420177 god i cant believe thats how big i used to be
5420178 too many dieters harm their bodies and psyches by skipping meals purging and popping pills in the quest for skinniness we should eat for nutrition and well being not solely to lose weight amidst all the deprivation and guilt associated with eating we often forget that fresh simple food is a joy in itself

5420380 we see a lot of our customers are splitting the roles of their database administrators and developers
5420381 service level requirements mean databases always have to be up and running and running as fast as they can so in production if there is a slowdown or spike of some sort they can react by profiling that database

5420443 as a boy i had an inclination to do something unique and outstanding one day i just happened to read about a chinese saint who grew his nails and thought i could do that to create a world record
5420444 growing my nails has been a really traumatic experience as i had to take the utmost care in nurturing their growth during the last 48 years for as many years i have used my right hand for all my day to day chores and nobody can believe i have also had to forego a peaceful nights sleep so its against all the odds of daily life including reading writing cycling walking and so on that i have successfully grown my nails

5420461 products such as herbal essences shampoo and olay complete body wash contain comparatively high levels of 1 4 dioxane a chemical that has been characterized as a probable human carcinogen by the epa and banned from personal care products in the european union
5420462 when the european union classified dibutyl phthalate dbp as a reproductive toxicant in 2004 and banned it from use in cosmetics and personal care products p amp g and many other companies were forced to reformulate products predominantly nail polish

5420470 by age 2 children have figured out that other people are a primary source of information about the world and they use social cues such as facial expression and where a person looks or points to gather that information as a result they are more likely to learn from a person on video whom they perceive as a conversational partner
5420471 in our study if a video was not interactive children were much more likely to dismiss the information being conveyed
5420472 there is good evidence from other research that watching shows such as dora the explorer and blues clues in which characters speak directly into the camera and wait for responses can positively impact childrens mental and language development
5420473 our new findings have implications for educational television aimed at toddlers as well as for the use of video images in research with this age group
5420474 as long as video exposure is a small part of infants and toddlers daily activities and those activities include lots of time interacting with family members parents should stop feeling guilty
5420475 whats bad is if the television is always on in the background this disrupts parent child interaction and the quality of childrens play
5420476 the doha round could become the first major multilateral trade talks to fail since the 1930s to prevent a collapse policymakers in the g 8 and key developing countries must resolve global monetary and current account imbalances counter the backlash against globalization and find a way to jolt the talks back to life
5420477 however the developed world is now saying that the rules of the global economy have gone far enough
5420478 international trade investment and migration all collapsed moreover the attempt to resuscitate the world economy after the wars end failed the global economy effectively disintegrated with the onset of the great depression and after that with an even bigger world war in which astonishingly high proportions of production went toward perpetrating destruction global markets were disrupted and disconnected first by economic warfare then by postwar protectionism

5420501 it was a great workout and there were a few guys who i would really like to see again im eager to see if the feelings are mutual
5420502 i was nervous at first but after the warm up everything was great all the participants were open minded and there to have fun i said yes to five girls and am hoping for a positive response i will definitely do this class again
5420503 i found it very interesting the difference in character that you see when a person is in a group fitness setting as opposed to in a bar during the workout you tend to see a more natural personality when the girls started to arrive at jack astors all polished up it was an entirely different dynamic

5420510 i must confess that i have been seduced by the zone diet at this time and have now been on it for a week it dont find it all that dissimilar from atkins though from a health standpoint i like the idea of specifically adding olive oil at meal times i have already been supplementing with high grade fish oil for a month and can tell you that i feel better for it but i find it most interesting that i feel the same way on the zone as i used to on atkins that is i can tell that im very mildly ketotic even though im eating relatively large amounts of vegetable carbs including some fruit this is great because when i feel like this i know im losing fat in fact the scale already shows a 5 pound loss in a week i havent been able to get motivated in a very long time sometimes you need a new diet to get started looks like this modest switch from atkins to zone is going to work for me but as you know the zone is really a low carb diet anyway
5420511 i tell people all the time to find a plan that works for you and then do it for the rest of your life it looks like the zone diet is custom made just for you congratulations i know you will keep at it and reap the rewards of that commitment im proud of you for making it happen for yourself you should be proud too when you see this thing to the end thanks for writing and for reading my blog i really appreciate it
5420512 jimmy i am amazed that after months and months of false starts i just slipped into this one and feel comfortably locked in i dont know where this locked in mode of being comes from but once im there i feel little desire to eat excluded items this phenomenon ought to be studied by physiologists and psychologists alike nonetheless i will continue to read your blog for encouragement and information the information in your blog is incredibly useful for the zone as well as other low carb diets thanks again

5420568 tell me what was your favorite part of school today
5420569 because everyone says that and if you didnt say that i wouldnt have the slightest idea what to say next
5420570 oh ive just been keeping track of the number of times someone tells me that and you are the 100th person who has said that in the last month thats a lot of people who dont have a budget for my product im beginning to wonder if the problem is my product
5420571 well maybe its because most companies are already buying a similar product from another vendor and they dont want to add an additional vendor
5420572 because that means i have successfully overcome all of the other objections you might have tossed out there and am only awaiting the time when the new budget is approved to get an order
5420573 yeah i didnt really think you meant that i was being a little bit flip let me ask you if you did have the budget right now would we be doing business today or is there some other stuff we should be discussing about how my products can help you achieve your goals
5420574 do you have an ice cream budget in your house
5420575 me neither when we want to buy ice cream we just do it and then maybe spend a little bit less on some other grocery item if the ice cream puts us over budget that just makes sense with ice cream but it makes sense with other purchases too let me ask you this if my product really helped you achieve your goals and you were convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt that this was true wouldnt you be able to find the money and then just cut back on some other business expense to avoid going over budget
5420576 this might be a good place to add a sentence about the current debate
5420577 i wanted to find out how mexican schools teach reading and writing especially what teachers and others consider valid or acceptable literacy instruction
5420578 so i observed classes at a local school and interviewed teachers and students over time this expanded to several more schools i also went into the community to see how people make use of reading and writing in their everyday lives
5420579 in mexican classrooms students had more freedom to speak theyre not as closely regulated kids talked a lot more and they talked more loudly there was overlapping speech in the u s this kind of speech would be considered interruptive but the speech was usually task oriented even though it didnt follow the same protocols
5420580 other researchers have documented teacher judgments that such speech is rude or ill mannered they feel as though they have to spend more time teaching politeness
5420581 special education instruction is not helpful in the ways that one would expect
5420582 these are students with cultural differences and what they need to overcome these differences is access to higher vocabulary english in classrooms and the curriculum content in special education classrooms can be simplified and watered down unfortunately this is too often true of instruction in esl classrooms as well
5420583 in some urban areas the numbers can be as high as 70 or 80 percent
5420584 students bring this concept of learning with them but its not a productive strategy in this context someone says describe this using your own words well what does that mean
5420585 our long term goal is to help teachers understand what parents and students prior educational experiences have been is it possible to create more familiarity why dont we let kids talk
5420586 were looking at the things we can do to best support pre service teachers we want to offer them good instructional practices
5420587 the cardinal principle of instruction is to really know your students in order to make instruction understandable typically teachers share a similar background with their students and there are a lot of shared cultural assumptions

5420599 eating fat whatever kind does not make you fat it does not increase blood stream saturated fat eating carbs does make you fat eating carbs does put saturated fat in your blood stream
5420600 eating fat does not make you fat storing fat makes you fat and carbohydrates play a major role in storing fat so the level of dietary carbohydrate is really the most important factor to control because it dictates what happens to fat carbs are dominant and fat is passive when carbohydrates are low fat tends to be burned and when carbohydrates are high dietary fat tends to be stored the same holds true for the atherogenic effects of saturated fat the body handles saturated fat better when carbohydrates are low

5420691 graduation rates are the achilles heel of american higher education recent reports show that we still are a world leader in offering access to higher education but we lag behind other countries in making sure that students graduate on time
5420692 our research seeks to connect the policies that are in place at the institutional level with state level policy to help leaders create a coherent strategy for ensuring student success
5420693 we will study both the state level characteristics and policies that have been shown to be successful in increasing overall graduation rates and institutional policies that can help students achieve their goals
5420694 we hope to show how these two sets of policies can be meaningfully connected to solve this pressing problem
5420695 this project will be helpful in identifying the states that are doing the best to bring about student completions and those doing the worst
5420696 the findings will better inform future policy setting to ensure greater success among the nations college students
5420697 and if getting buzz means spoiling some things ill take buzz any day
5420698 this center will give us hard data that we can use to finally understand the relationship between performance and incentives and will give policymakers real input on how best to invest resources to improve student learning and success
5420699 nashville understands the importance of education and the value of innovative research
5420700 having the national center on performance incentives at vanderbilt means that the lessons learned here in our city are ones that will provide crucial information to educators and policymakers across our country
5420701 i am impressed with the honesty and openness of the researchers on the project and believe that this collaborative work will be worthwhile an incentive is in the eye of the beholder
5420702 this research will help us better define the word as it relates to teaching
5420703 as a national research and development center charged by the federal government with exercising leadership on performance incentives in education our team is committed to a fair and honest evaluation not some predetermined outcome

5420709 tobacco consumption statistics could be misleading in terms of their impact on health status studies suggest that the effect of smoking is often not apparent for many decades
5420710 policymakers in the united states and in other countries have begun to pay greater attention to chronic disease
5420711 it is becoming an increasingly financial burden in the united states particularly as the u s baby boomer population ages
5420712 these two grants will build on the previous work of our researchers
5420713 it means they can continue searching for solutions aimed at preventing birth defects and saving the lives of infants and children
5420714 birth defects are the leading cause of infant mortality and the cause of nearly 70 percent of the anomalies remains unknown
5420715 each proposed cobre supported research project addresses significant unanswered questions in the area of birth defects and may have a significant impact on major biomedical health care issues
5420716 factors such as education among women average per capita income and degree of income inequality explain more of the cross national variation in overall health status than the level of health spending
5420717 in terms of outcomes and satisfaction the united states may have reached the position of diminishing returns for spending on medical care

5420744 after listening to someone who speaks in circles i think our executives appreciated someone who approaches issues linearly first this then that then those on the way back to the office all we could talk about was the differences in what our consultant is doing to what you recommended your approach and philosophy on computer networking was absorbed and appreciated whole heartedly

5420747 we want to see it everywhere but more importantly sic we want this sign to take the world by storm
5420748 we believe that 5 0 5 5 percent growth may still be possible though downside risks abound
5420749 these remain to be the wildcard as analysts are split over the direction of oil prices there is however a risk of a more severe us recession
5420750 we are also wary of a scenario of rising inflation and interest rates coupled with peso depreciation due to unmanaged second round effects of high commodities prices as well as of political maneuvers of the leadership a very unpopular president to stay beyond 2010
5420751 rising inflation and interest rates will likely continue to dampen consumption and private investment this year as foreshadowed by weaker business and consumer confidence reflected in government and private surveys while prolonged weakness in the united states and weakening of other major markets such as japan and the european union will continue to limit demand for the countrys exports
5420752 past monetary easing may also have served to sustain demand with bank lending rising by over 15 percent in may under the central banks new reporting system notably a 22 percent annual increase in household consumption loans in may

5420775 for many mentees a caring and consistent adult presence can make a positive difference in their outlook and aspirations
5420776 is giving students an opportunity to find out for themselves how to live an effective adult life for some this is their first experience with disenfranchised people they learn that if these kids are behind there are a number of factors that have come together to cause that to happen many of them will someday find themselves in positions where they hold the purse strings make decisions or influence others i hope this is knowledge they will pass along

5420780 if you read history you will find that the christians who did most for the present world were precisely those who thought most of the next it is since christians have largely ceased to think of the other world that they have become so ineffective in this
5420781 it was once when i read a silly fairy tale called the three princes of serendip as their highnesses travelled they were always making discoveries by accidents and sagacity of things which they were not in quest of for instance one of them discovered that a camel blind of the right eye had travelled the same road lately because the grass was eaten only on the left side where it was worse than on the right now do you understand serendipity
5420782 it should be recognized that serendipitous discoveries are of significant value in the advancement of science and often present the foundation for important intellectual leaps of understanding
5420783 im a net artist its a cartoon video with the voice of a net artist looking for attention he explains what net art is and the problems he has in order to arrive to people and to be considered as an art maker
5420784 now come to venice meet the art its a honour
5420785 check out the state partys spreadsheet on caucus votes and youll find obama winning nearly everywhere and strongly from the smallest most remote and most republican counties to the larger more competitive population centers
5420786 there was a sense that the candidate cared about utah
5420787 youth turnout was much much higher than at any other time
5420788 he put 10 full time staff in north dakota and they organized a great grassroots campaign
5420789 one of the reasons so many seemingly virtually all active democratic politicians in the state signed on with obama is that theyre hoping for access to that organization and what it entails
5420790 obamas organization right now stands as one of the best that idaho democrats have seen in many years
5420791 instinctively shy away from democratic candidates who reek of the party machine
5420792 its a widely practiced sport in these states to demonize prominent democrats especially east coast liberals and clinton is clearly perceived that way here
5420793 i think people out here are so starved for somebody
5420794 that theyll vote for obama happily rather than endorse the same old same old be they a democrat or a republican
5420795 clearly mrs clinton would have negative downballot effects statewide and sen obama would not have that effect especially in omaha and lincoln the states two largerst cities where most of the registered democrats live
5420796 if clinton gets the nomination every republican in idaho will turn out to vote against her and any other democrats obama wouldnt be that kind of a lightning rod
5420797 but thats fine tomorrow isnt so far away and at least it gives me a bit of extra time to spend with you my faithful readers

5420805 being predictable is a big benefit for commercial adoption and were very focused on having as many companies building products on software coming out of the eclipse project as possible
5420806 people not just using the platform but a range of eclipse based products so interdependencies and version compatibility are issues this tradition of releasing a group of products and technologies on the same day every year allows companies to make their product plans with a high degree of confidence
5420807 being part of the release train can help a project grow its community and mature its development and other processes
5420808 for many projects the release train has become almost a rite of passage a lot of projects view it as a way of signaling their maturity and readiness to become part of the broader eclipse platform

5420845 food choice alone does not make a person healthy or unhealthy
5420846 eliminating completely or over emphasizing the importance of a certain food

5421232 thank you so much for writing to me today it took a lot of guts to approach someone you dont even know about a problem like this being overweight isnt any fun at all and i certainly will be praying for you to find a way to overcome this lifelong struggle as i did when youve been fat its hard to think theres any other way out there or that youve got any hope of being anything but that fat person that you are today thats the way i felt when i allowed my weight to get up over 400 pounds when you reach this point life pretty much sucks you feel like everythings fine but you know somethings wrong you want to be thin like everyone else and you are tired of people whispering behind your back about you theyd never say it to your face unless its a 6th grade kid but people can be very hurtful so what do you do do you just give up thinking nothing will work do you just resign to the fact that you were destined to be fat and thats the way god wants you to stay for the rest of your life if that was my mentality then i would have never lost over 180 pounds and kept it off for good while i lost my weight on the low carb lifestyle note that i didnt call it a diet i encourage people to find something anything that can help them lose the weight and lose it for good this time if you cant stick with the plan then you need to find one that you can stick with also exercise has to become a part of your life as dreaded as that sounds to you right now believe me you will be craving exercise very soon you will i wrote a book about my experience and i encourage you to read it if for no other reason than to be inspired by someone who has overcome i poured my heart and soul out in that book so that others would be motivated to do the same as i did of course you can also browse around my blog at livinlavidalowcarb com where i write columns encouraging and educating people about healthy living principles diet nutrition and of course low carb thank you again for writing to me today and i want you to feel comfortable enough to write me anytime you are a special gift from god and i dont want you to ever forget that regardless of how much you weigh you are precious in his sight because he created you for a purpose that you may not even realize yet never let go of that fact as you travel down this journey of life the lords not finished with you yet in fact hes just getting started you can do it i believe in you now go for it

5421355 so why are we employing children why arent their parents in these jobs instead
5421356 because the children they can be hired and exploited much more cheaply in india we must come to a place where child labor is not acceptable

5421439 many road signs are only put up so that we are covered for insurance purposes and not necessarily because they provide the driver with useful information
5421440 there were about 50 accidents a year at the town s main intersection before the change but now we haven t seen any that is certainly a good sign that the new concept works well

5421453 he has the qualities we expect of our leaders and is the kind of leader our soldiers deserve
5421454 i can t do much about it i m being optimistic about everything taking it with a smile having a good attitude about it disappointed that i didn t get my one shot but that s ok because when i went to the academy i initially went to the academy to be an officer
5421455 clearly we never intended to violate the department of defense policy
5421456 but after review we found what we consider active duty service the department is not considering active duty service

5421460 content has always been a big part of the livecycle workflow
5421461 the update gives our customers the ability to deliver content rich engagement applications whether its a form in process a welcome packet product information or marketing info faster through a fully integrated set of content services
5421462 it can be designed right into an application just as all of the other solution components
5421463 it allows our customers to have the content repository element right there ready to go
5421464 the creation assembly distribution and archival of adobe pdf files from a wide range of business applications and formats
5421465 and weve noticed some trends in their usage of it weve captured a lot of the learning from both management and coding standpoints and weve developed application elements that can be downloaded for free theyre not just samples or templates but actual elements of code that our customers can deploy
5421466 someone fills out a form submits it and that kicks off a workflow environment
5421467 i would like to have seen more of an emphasis on helping organizations really understand how their it teams need to be structured to take the best advantage of livecycle here they are with an enterprise solution but its not always obvious who in the enterprise should be developing applications on top of it what kinds of roles and what kinds of skills are needed so i quite like the solution accelerators part of which looks at the staffing question its something that was needed
5421468 while microsofts announcement of its intention to provide framework support for entity architectures was received with enthusiasm the entity framework itself has consistently proved to be cause for significant concern
5421469 inordinate focus on the data aspect of entities leads to degraded entity architectures excess code is needed to deal with lack of lazy loading the shared canonical model contradicts software best practices a lack of persistence ignorance causes business logic to be harder to read write and modify causing development and maintenance costs to increase at an exaggerated rate and excessive merge conflicts with source control in team environments
5421470 the choices on these features were heavily considered but we had to deal with the tension between trying to add more features verses trying to stay true to our initial goal which was to lay the core foundation for a multiple release strategy for building out a broader data platform offering
5421471 we are determined to address this particular developer community in earnest while still furthering the investment in the overall data platform
5421472 the concerns we have heard are from a very vocal subgroup
5421473 while we certainly take them seriously and are planning on addressing many of their concerns specifically around persistence ignorance in the next release we have a large number of customers who see value in the entity framework as it is in version 1
5421474 on the whole i consider the no confidence manifesto to be doctrinaire and an example of attempts to enforce political correctness in software architecture id wager that ef would perform more than adequately in 80 percent or more of the applications that require o rm tools
5421475 one thing is clear from both the community complaints and microsofts response entity framework is a v1 product that may not yet be ready for industrial use

5421477 consumer spending on software is at record levels and the game business seems to actually benefit from a recession because games are a relatively cheap form of home entertainment
5421478 the wii does not appear to be a fad and it has the chance to be one of the best selling systems of all time
5421479 with multiple platforms establishing healthy installed bases there is a growing need to look at potential sales on a given platform based on not just aggregate hardware sales but also game type
5421480 the wii not only has unique features and a broad demographic appeal but nintendo is dominant as a software publisher for many third party publishers this means they will have much greater success on the xbox 360 and playstation 3 even if wii sales continue to be strong

5421489 we believe that students are capable of much more rigorous and interesting learning but it takes careful thought and research plus sustained hard work and persistence with the politics of schooling to make it happen
5421490 these include the usual forms of arithmetic but also child appropriate forms of geometry data modeling uncertainty and early algebra
5421491 science education is designed to be cumulative so that important ideas learned at one grade are lifted into the next and given enhanced mathematical and scientific power thats why we emphasize modeling as the heart of science constructing and revising models of the world including mathematical models is a powerful way of describing and testing scientific ideas important elements of modeling such as drawing diagramming mapping representing and data modeling are within reach even of young students
5421492 because the forms of mathematics we emphasize are not typically taught in elementary grades
5421493 we designed instruments to assess student achievement the achievement items assessed five related strands of mathematics number geometry measure early algebra and data modeling and statistics
5421494 performance of participating students compared very favorably to national levels of performance for all naep items

5421505 people were not born to be slaves even if those slaves were dressed in gold and ate at the tables of their masters there was a divine principle underlying the situation human beings had been created free and should therefore move in the direction of freedom the united states had tried to make young puerto ricans forget their language and culture to make them speak english and think of themselves as north americans they wanted to buy puerto ricans with banal things the united states gave puerto rico nothing exploiting the territory 24 hours a day while it was claimed that puerto rico could not survive without the united states puerto rican heads might be bowed but they were a people who would rise from their knees

5421517 ill be following up my alixe review with reviews of other lightweight and small footprint linux distributions including vector linux light when its released
5421518 this particular user has his own criteria for using small livecd type distros such as puppy can be put on a 200mb mini cd and on a 128mb pendrive small for portable use can run on low end hardware
5421519 also how do you find vector linux 5 9 unstable also how do you find vector linux 5 9 unstable you claim simplymepis is more stable which implies there must be some instability in vl i havent encountered any id love to know what makes it unstable if noting else it would be something to report to the developers to be fixed

5421529 effective early intervention during the preschool years for children at highest risk for school failure may improve their chances of learning to read and to learn from reading in the early elementary school years
5421530 bringing together the big three curriculum linguistic content and teaching strategy in a single intervention is the best we can do both conceptually and practically in teaching young children
5421531 were going to implement a curriculum that i helped to write with judy schickedanz called opening the world of learning owl
5421532 it provides a lot of guidance to teachers in ways that help children build their knowledge of the world and their vocabulary as well as basic literacy skills
5421533 ann has been developing this over a number of years and shes used it for children with significant language delays or behavior problems as well as children with autism and with down syndrome well be targeting the lowest children in these classrooms in a very focused way that we think can have major effects on their language and early literacy development
5421534 prior to this i did a descriptive study where we followed low income children from age three up into middle school
5421535 we observed their experiences in homes and classrooms and found that the experiences in the classrooms accounted for as much variation in outcomes in kindergarten and then fourth and seventh grade as did our measures of the home background people would never have expected that the preschool quality measures could match the impact of the parents
5421536 a large number of registrations from international publishers and developers are arriving at the moment
5421537 the growing foreign participation underlines the status now enjoyed by germany as the most important european trade show venue for computer and video games
5421538 the games convention is synonymous with the opportunities offered by the leipzig venue within the shortest possible time this trade show has developed from a national into an international benchmark fair with numerous foreign customers we have many regulars for the gc with groups from individual companies continuing to grow over time our guests feel very comfortable here and they show us that they appreciate the conditions available in leipzig
5421539 thanks to wide ranging cooperation we have adequate hotel availability and can find rooms at short notice if required
5421540 the city is flexible in its reaction to growing international event business so that we are ideally equipped for the future
5421541 from dan armano will you continue the development of delphi for php
5421542 from brazil what can codegear community members expect from embarcadero in terms of investment in the ide products
5421543 from brazil are there any plans to include er studio in delphi
5421544 from brad i havent heard any news about what jim douglas status will be post merger hopefully he will still be in the picture for awhile
5421545 from serge i know that the ibm as 400 market is not a target for embarcadero today i would like to know if embarcadero will consider this market and will continue the efforts of codegear in the system i modernization market with delphi 400
5421546 from richard winston codegear appears to be focusing on independent software vendors and small teams borlands alm business appears to be focused on large team efforts and so is a mismatch for codegears emphasis what sort of customer does embarcadero focus on and how does that make embarcadero a better fit with codegear than codegear was with borland
5421547 from jose araujo many brazilian delphi developers are thinking that delphi is over what can you tell the delphi community to make them feel that delphi has a future
5421548 from didier gasser morlay delphi has always been database agnostic allowing connection to closed and open source databases either directly or via 3rd party components will embarcadero products embark pun intended on the support of the open source postgresql mysql firebird to name a few boat
5421549 from m th embarcadero is a strong player in data designing area codegear is a strong player in providing tools in data processing using programming language elements do you have plans to provide solutions in data visualization business intelligence area i think about olap data cubes data mining drill down features also
5421550 from m th how do you see the communitys role in the shaping process of your products
5421551 from patrick moloney please say something about the plans or commitment for interbase or lack thereof
5421552 from brazil does embarcadero plan to make changes to the product road maps putting out more information and more aggressive plans
5421553 from brazil what the future of c considering that in the last few years codegear didnt have as high a priority for this product
5421554 from brazil when the acquisition is completed who will take care of business here in brazil since embarcadero does not a local office here
5421555 does the buy out see any changes to the plans for the next release of the studio product
5421556 id like to know what will happen to codegears partners and also about the certifications for delphi and other tools
5421557 from several is there any relationship to the value of the acquisition 23m 7m receivables and what embarcadero and codegear will be able to accomplish together
5421558 from david boventer are you going to be active within the micro isv community and continue the support of the codegear ide at conferences such as the sic taking place in july in the us and the european software conference taking place in november in berlin germany
5421559 from m th are you considering synchronizing the metadata changes between actual database schema and its representation in the programming language
5421560 will cg move to sf from current location or would here be a new location altogether
5421561 are your planing to develop some new data access technologies in codegear ides
5421562 does the platform independent streak mean we may see a return of delphi for linux
5421563 will the ide products lose the codegear brand and take on the embarcadero brand it took a lot of effort to establish the codegear brand
5421564 are there any plans about changing partnership programs in any way
5421565 will support for interbase 2007 and other later versions and blackfish be added to er studio
5421566 are there any plans to make delphi and other codegear products more visible in the specialized press especially in europe
5421567 so far i only found references to interbase 4 on embarcaderos product spec pages
5421568 after several years of uncertainty time is of essence do you set yourself a time limit to announce the plans post finalization of the acquisition
5421569 usually adding men to a project produces a delay for a while how do you see the cooperation between codegear amp embarcadero teams in this regard
5421570 latin america is a large market with a lot of opportunities and future for all of your products we want to know what about the plans of embarcadero to stay and step forward in this area
5421571 is there any plans for future development of ado and bde technologies
5421572 from francoise pascal will the new company offer language packages for its ide software as borland and codegear did in the past for the great pleasure of german french and japanese developers
5421573 delphi will continue to be improved also on non database field i mean that it will have a 64bit platform and maybe multi platform development for linux mac or embarcadero will focus the development on the database field
5421574 documentation level by level step by step tutorials to consolidate the use the tools in the developers community around the world are they coming
5421575 thanks for taking the time to talk to the community
5421576 delphi has to compete with visual studios competitive price point will embarcadero change either lower or raise the price point of the codegear ide tools
5421577 how do you think to tackle the suddenly growth of a community with 3 2 mio users with a different history mindset etc will you try to leverage their knowledge
5421578 i dont know what youve done to the sound but its gone from the unusable mush i have had in past interwise conferences to todays
5421579 the livin la vida low carb show with jimmy moore
5421580 i received my shipment yesterday and i have to say wow fabulous delicious remarkable

5421582 i still cant believe how fantastic these chocoperfection chocolate bars really are i ate 4 of them last week and lost 2 pounds yeah thank you thank you thank you from the bottom of my heart for telling us about this amazing product
5421583 for every study that showed that shareholder activists had a negative impact on share price there was one to show they improved it

5421586 why he was firing at anything if he didnt know where all the members of the hunting party were
5421587 people talk about the windows tax dude you just paid a 350 linux tax by not going mainstream in your hardware
5421588 in case you hadnt noticed most bloggers dont make a lot of money from their blogging efforts thus samples of your product t shirts tickets to the stanley cup finals etc can go a long way im not saying you can buy bloggers but you can make them happy pretty easily dollar for dollar schwag for bloggers is one of the best marketing investments
5421589 although many people have made good livings sucking up to get ahead just look at the politicians i cant help but wonder if guy hadnt ever worked for apple or wrote a book would we be reading his blog today
5421590 lets be honest the real reason why they are writing about making your blog successful is because they know that is what we want to read and they are padding their posts with search engine friendly keywords
5421591 but im not sure what your point it blogging should be for people who havent done anything you wouldnt read jack welchs book if he wasnt ceo of ge you wouldnt watch steve jobs keynote if he wasnt ceo of apple
5421592 i have been waiting for the release of ubuntu 8 04 because i am using ubuntu 6 06 on my company laptop and we have to install exclusively long term support releases
5421593 ubuntu was the first gnu linux distribution to ship gnash and although gnash runs on dozens of other distributions it usually runs best on ubuntu
5421594 gnash supports many swf v7 features and actionscript 2 classes with growing support for swf v8 and v9 now all we need to do is increase our funding so we can get as close to 100 compatible as possible in a reasonable amount of time
5421595 for me as a kubuntu user the big thing has to be kde 4 since kde 4 0 2 is far more usable than the initial kde 4 0 release i hope more users will give it a try i am also impressed by the inclusion of wubi no more excuses windows users a major turning point i think for ubuntu is bulletproof x this is new functionality in the x windows system which makes it possible to match software to varied user hardware and gracefully find the highest common denominator if there are hardware or software complications theres nothing more discouraging than having a blank screen if youve no display and no other pc how can you find out how to fix it i know ive been there so hopefully bulletproof x will make that a thing of the past i dont think the release of hardy will cause any major changes in the pc industry but as ubuntu and linux start to become easier to use and gain the same features as windows therell be less and less excuses not to at least give ubuntu a try
5421596 the training we provide is for both the general public who are invited and for people to whom mr king is giving a computer most of the people we teach have some experience with computers but even those who dont have found the experience to be positive and the introduction to ubuntu to be a good first step into learning how to use a computer all students who participate in the training are encouraged to train others and pass on what theyve learned
5421597 about 25 000 worth of high tech equipment and supplies including a laser cutter a vinyl cutter normally for making signs but used here to cut copper for circuits and a 3 d milling machine to make circuit boards all connected to linux based computers loaded with open source design and manufacturing software
5421598 everyone has so far taken very well to ubuntu and what it provides to the average user some are happy to rid themselves of viruses and crashes that other oss seem to be riddled with others are excited to be taking part in something new and interesting they see more possibilities to how we use computers as for 8 04 ive been running it since alpha 3 it has many new improvements and more importantly stability i think ubuntu has come a long way and hardy heron will certainly be proof of that progress
5421599 if you had grown up in my family youd experience highs and lows too theres nothing wrong with me other than being born a neal
5421600 the recent popular demonstrations in several arab countries including egypt saudi arabia oman and jordan in support of the palestinian intifada demonstrate the changing nature of activism of the arab street
5421601 what events in france have done is discredit the liberal recipe so badly that even those who are not prepared to admit that american policy may have been right must now root around for an alternative theory

5421613 illegal immigrant workers in the united states are now providing the system with a subsidy of as much as
5421614 the fact is that illegals are paying into the system but never getting any of the money back this helps the social security administration stay solvent shhh perhaps another day this post is not about ss reform
5421615 starting in the late 1980s the social security administration received a flood of w 2 earnings reports with incorrect sometimes simply fictitious social security numbers it stashed them in what it calls the earnings suspense file in the hope that someday it would figure out whom they belonged to the file has been mushrooming ever since 189 billion worth of wages ended up recorded in the suspense file over the 1990s two and a half times the amount of the 1980s in the current decade the file is growing on average by more than 50 billion a year generating 6 billion to 7 billion in social security tax revenue and about 1 5 billion in medicare taxes the mismatched fit like a glove on illegal immigrants known geographic distribution and the patchwork of jobs they typically hold an audit found that more than half of the 100 employers filing the most earnings reports with false social security numbers from 1997 through 2001 came from just three states california texas and illinois

5421629 this study provides the first direct evidence that reducing tor function could be clinically beneficial to counter insulin resistance metabolic syndrome and diabetes we believe further studies on fruit flies are invaluable to discovering more details about this pathway
5421630 make a list of the features of metabolic syndrome then make a list of the things that carbohydrate restriction is good at fixing theyre the same list somehow we never really noticed that we know the cause of metabolic syndrome is often linked to disruption of insulin thus the key to treating metabolic syndrome is to control insulin and carbohydrates are the major stimulus for insulin
5421631 the most obvious factor in the obesity epidemic is the drastic increase in carbohydrate consumption in recent years and the decrease in fat consumption so the story is consistent i think people have learned the value of reducing carbohydrates during the media popularization of low carb diets but they are still making it hard for themselves by also trying to reduce fat when fat seems to be much less important a factor than carbohydrates the bottom line is that if you reduce carbohydrates you can be less concerned about your fat intake and that often makes it much easier to stick to a beneficial new diet or lifestyle change

5421647 if you read the blog headline or the comments this is mostly portrayed as linux vs windows in reality that just isnt true
5421648 there are many situations where windows or commercial proprietary unix really and truly is the best fit
5421649 why is microsoft so threatened by linux could it be that linux is in most cases a better server product than windows
5421650 when the migration costs are exorbitant training costs software porting new licenses for commercial software that cant easily be replaced by floss equivalents and the cost of testing and deploying new code are all issues that can work in microsofts favor in such situations if a customer is seriously interested in moving away from windows i recommend doing so when hardware and or software need to be refreshed anyway to mitigate some of the costs
5421651 the second situation which applies equally to the server and the desktop is when a very specialized piece of software is needed for the business and its only available for windows to use a desktop example there still isnt an adequate replacement for autocad that runs on linux this scenario is becoming less and less common but it still does exist more so in the business world than on the consumer desktop we discussed in the comments on my previous article the best use for windows in the corporate server room the only really good use i can think of is as a specialized applications server
5421652 the third scenario is when a business has a customer who demands windows and not fulfilling that demand will cost the company a valuable customer in those scenarios a company can try and sell a linux solution by pointing out advantages over windows if the customer isnt buying then you have to weigh the cost of losing that customer its often many customers not just one in the end the business has no choice but to satisfy customer demand even if the customers are making a poor or uneducated choice money talks
5421653 its not surprising the linux build on an eee won that sort of contest by all accounts xandros has been heavily tweaked for the diminutive machine whereas windows xp hasnt or at least not to the same level

5421691 chaos and confusion and anything but an effective counterinsurgency strategy
5421692 there are also some forces that can be made from the tribes or from local areas that could be attached to the iraqi military forces that can complement or supplement or add to the existing more formal forces
5421693 the issue is getting them to fight insurgents outside their tribal area and for us to be aware of their hidden agendas so far the tribal engagement strategy from a military standpoint has not done what it was advertised to do

5421737 we believe the seabird deaths the scientists recorded might be just the tip of the iceberg
5421738 it suggests that around 18 000 seabirds may be killed annually in this fishery alone

5421740 the impact of this one local fishery has very widespread geographical repercussions

5421803 in a way i sympathise with the extremist religious groups claiming that homosexuality will destroy our countries and governments the long term effect of homosexuals is yet to be seen the natural vs unnatural argument is one that should be rested and the real questions that should be asked is if homosexuality can be reduced by ensuring healthier foetus development and child upbringing if it should be reduced that is if we can make small adjustments to developing babies to prevent them from going through the problems of gender identity and finally if all women really are lesbians or bisexuals

5422078 well you can tell by the way i use my walk
5422079 over the past decade or so we have seen an unprecedented rise in the choice of operating system at the cost of our own native operating systems
5422080 the effect of other operating systems on the software industry in the uk has been devastating annually the cost of damage runs into the millions of pounds and its about time something was done these foreign pieces of software erode our own sales leaving developers vulnerable to unemployment it could take hundreds of years for the software trade to regenerate
5422081 history is replete with examples of our own national treasures been lost risc os on the acorn archimedes was displaced by its american cousins and frankly i am no longer willing to tolerate these events
5422082 this would mean nationalising software patents and we never nationalise anything anymore well usually
5422083 this is another example of government stupidity blocking such a specific type of download is very hard or to put it another way this will likely become very simple to circumvent
5422084 for a government that supposedly promotes free trade this scheme is a complete contradiction of what has gone before this project is bound to cost vast quantities of money for very little benefit if any
5422085 i think youll find this to be totally in line with past government behaviour after all its liable to cost vast quantities of money for very little benefit if any
5422086 i wonder why its just linux that is being stopped surely its easier to prevent sales of operating systems that come in a box
5422087 we really need the public to get out of the mindset that these foreign pieces of software are stealing jobs from our workers they are in fact a huge boon to our economy and help to keep prices down across markets by being cheaper and more efficient than many native implementations
5422088 why didnt clinton take care of bin laden when he had the chance
5422089 no why should i have to ive got an assistant to know that for me
5422090 last time i saw him he was headed for the third cave on the left just over the mountain there
5422091 this event is one of the earliest instances of using twitter to transfer an event as social and active as a wine tasting into online realms the end result a resounding success when you have a social drink which is best enjoyed sharing experiences with friends it works perfectly with online communication tools
5422092 its a struggle for us watching you there isnt a future for you here
5422093 youre too strict you dont go off the path you dont play you would do well in forum or maybe even lab i looked at your notebook youre a thinker im sorry but you cant be in atelier
5422094 the enterprise architects and the software architects have to get together and stop fighting each other
5422095 we want this to be a really special event one that the people lucky enough to be there will talk about for a long time we can assure everyone that the money raised will be put to an extremely worthwhile use
5422096 this gig is for a good cause and one we are happy to give our full support

5422107 according to government estimates this legislation would result in average savings of 820 a year for federal annuitants with increases in healthcare premiums far surpassing increases in cost of living adjustments this legislation would help balance the books for federal and military retirees

5422136 b2evo index php tech php 2008 03 07 interesting paper from martin fowler abo
5422137 if you wait for people to come to you youll only get small problems you must go find them the big problems are the ones people dont realize they have in the first place
5422138 duodecad tag the idea of this tag is to write a list of the top twelve it may be more or less than a dozen blogs you like most they can also be the most recent blogs you have visited or just your friends blogs you also write some brief about them and they are supposed to do the same thing too
5422139 the only excuse you have for not calling me is that youre dead if youre dead and reading this r i p if youre alive and reading this im going to kill you
5422140 because i missed you so much im back in ny i just got here i couldnt take it anymore i was so depressed

5422146 george stephanopoulous attempted to use the article to cross examine donald rumsfeld on sunday morning
5422147 so is there a third way that will allow democrats to both criticize the war and be seen as hawkish
5422148 the big jihad the important one is the work on the self and in your own immediate environment your social world natural on a large scale however we can talk about a transhistorical revolution a revolution that never goes away its always there in some form or another even now thats what i mean by jihad
5422149 it wasnt really a very serious decision its just something i did a piece of writing and i thought it was funny and that maybe some of this ideas were kind of dangerous and maybe i shouldnt be so quick to identify myself right away as the author then i also thought that creating a persona would spill some mystery around some of the ideas that it might be attractive i didnt have no idea how attractive i wasnt trying to create a guru or a leader i never wanted to be a star but some people insist that i am i really dont i think that fame is a horrible think actually i was trying to avoid being famous by being hakim bey that was how stupid i was
5422150 i got interested in the renegados they were westerners christians who were captured by the islamic pirates in the mediterranean and they voluntary switched side and became muslims basically there are writings about their crimes their series of crimes but there were never any intentionality given to this people
5422151 the political structures that the pirates invented for themselves were radically democratic there are articles under which people signed up on the ship to go on a course and these articles are radically democratic documents the captain was elected and if they didnt like him they de elected him the captain gets like one and a half shares and everyone else get one share so the captain is not getting 40 times as much or 100 times as much he is only getting maybe twice as much
5422152 i dont think i have invented it i noticed that these things existed i didnt invent it all i was doing was noticing that the human being have a tendency to come together to enjoy freedom even just for a short time rather than just live life in misery on their needs that is a natural human thing i just tried to notice it and put a label on it a good dinner party is a taz because nobody tells you how to behave there is no king of the dinner party there is no senate there is no police marcel duchamp said once youre lucky if you have one or two original ideas in all your life time and i guess that was mine i think on that slogan because in some way it have become out of my control
5422153 if you have to retreat make sure its not a random road not everybody washing out just like chickens with their heads cut off you have to retreat in orderly fashion towards sources of logistical support meaning supplies and munitions and more reinforcements so when youre retreating i think invisibility is a very good method its a tactic in self if youre guerrilla army i think we are to sort of consider ourselves on some level reduced to guerrilla tactics because thats the best we can afford
5422154 they can harass you until you have spend all your money it doesnt cost them anything thats what they do its their job they do it all the time everyday we know theyre going around knocking on the doors of people now who are planning to go to new york and how do they know that these people are planning to go to new york they found their names on the internet wow cool
5422155 without music life would be a mistake as nietzsche said and this is of course much more true for a revolutionary life than for the stupid life of a capitalist squirrel i understand that there is some young musicians that refused to record and i found that very interesting very hopeful i hope to see much more of that because i think what music can do is actually shape the taz but in order to do that it has to be physical it has to be presential and it has to be for me not for the market for us music would be the very form that the revolt im thinking of will take
5422156 most of my friends think that it will change things that its a very important movie farenheit 9 11 that michael moore is great that its a miracle that his left wing voice is still being heard i dont know it seems to me that there is a market composed of left wing liberals and they need their tv channels their products their movies their music they need their own kind of green car or whatever their green cell phone these things take energy away and that is what i find disturbing about them they make people feel satisfied with themselves instead of being dissatisfied with reality
5422157 i think it would be much more interesting not to have demonstrations against the big political party conventions it would be better if nobody showed up at all they could just say all these people are so boring and stupid and irrelevant that is not worth protest against them its a waste of energy you have all these people putting all this time organizing their passion putting even their bodies in danger in some cases all to burn up of a kind of anger so that doesnt exist anymore well i think it would be much better if we just stayed home and got angrier and angrier and angrier until we got angry enough to do something real
5422158 i am looking at a lot of people alone in their rooms in front of a screen and a typewriter this is the revolution that we were waiting for sorry no thats not a revolution its counterrevolutionary in five years many people will agree right now almost nobody believes me i make this as a prediction
5422159 i feel so helpless and hopeless right now in the situation of the world today i frankly dont see that these ideas have very much possible influence over a situation involving millions and millions of people and trillions and trillions of dollars there are countries of the size of planets and corporations of the size of countries i mean where in a world that is organize on those principles are any of these ideas these sweet ideas of poetic revolution suppose to take us what meaning can this ideas possible have to a leper in bombay well i have to leave that as a question
5422160 la gran jihad la importante es el trabajo contigo mismo y en tu entorno inmediato tu mundo social natural de todas formas a gran escala podemos hablar de una revoluci n transhist rica una revoluci n que nunca desaparece siempre est ah de una manera u otra incluso ahora eso es lo que yo quiero decir con jihad
5422161 la verdad es que no fue una decisi n seria simplemente fue algo que hice algo que escrib y pens que era entretenido y que quiz s algunas de las ideas eran un tanto peligrosas y no deb a identificarme enseguida como su autor entonces pens que crear un personaje a adir a cierto misterio a esas ideas que pod a ser algo atractivo no ten a ni idea de cu nto no estaba intentando crear un gur ni un l der nunca he querido ser una estrella pero alguna gente insiste en que lo soy no lo soy creo que la fama es una cosa horrible en realidad estaba evitando ser famoso siendo hakim bey fui as de est pido
5422162 me interes por los renegados que eran cristianos occidentales capturados por piratas isl micos en el mediterr neo y cambiaban de lado voluntariamente y se hac an musulmanes b sicamente hay escritos sobre sus cr menes su cr menes en serie pero nunca se ha dado una intenci n a esa gente
5422163 las estructuras pol ticas que se inventaron los piratas para s mismos eran radicalmente democr ticas
5422164 no creo que yo me haya inventado nada simplemente me fij en que exist an esas cosas lo nico que estaba haciendo era se alar que el ser humano tiende a agruparse para disfrutar de la libertad incluso aunque sea durante poco tiempo en lugar de vivir una vida miserable basada en sus propias necesidades es una cosa natural de los humanos yo s lo la se al y le puse un nombre una buena reuni n para cenar es una taz porque nadie te dice c mo tienes que comportarte no hay un rey de la cena ni senado ni polic a marcel duchamp dijo una vez tendr s suerte si tienes una o dos ideas originales en toda tu vida y supongo que esa fue la m a creo en esa frase porque en cierto sentido se me ha ido de las manos
5422165 si quieres quejarte por algo aseg rate de no hacerlo aleatoriamente
5422166 pueden acosarte hasta que te hayas gastado todo el dinero no les cuesta nada eso es lo que hacen es su trabajo lo hacen todo el rato todos los d as sabemos que est n llamando a las puertas de gente que esta planeando ir a nueva york y c mo saben que van a ir a nueva york encuentran sus nombres en internet vaya qu listos
5422167 sin m sica la vida ser a un error como dijo nietzsche y eso es mucho m s cierto en la vida de un revolucionario que en la vida est pida de un tibur n capitalista he escuchado que algunos m sicos j venes se est n negando a trabajar para discogr ficas y me parece muy interesante muy esperanzador espero ver m s cosas as porque creo que la m sica es lo que da forma a la taz pero para hacerlo tiene que ser f sico presencial y tiene que ser para m no para el mercado la m sica ser la forma concreta que tomar la revoluci n en la que pienso
5422168 la mayor a de mis amigos creen que cambiar las cosas que es una pel cula muy importante farenheit 9 11 que michael moore es magn fico que es un milagro que esa voz de la izquierda se siga escuchando no s a m me parece que hay un mercado compuesto por liberales de izquierda que necesitan sus canales de tv sus productos sus pel culas su m sica necesitan su propio coche ecol gico o lo que sea su m vil ecol gico esas cosas drenan la energ a y eso es lo que me preocupa hacen que la gente se sienta satisfecha consigo misma en lugar de sentirse insatisfecha con la realidad
5422169 creo que ser a mucho m s interesante que no hubiese manifestaciones contra las grandes convenciones de los partidos ser a mejor que no fuese nadie podr an decir simplemente toda esa gente es tan aburrida y est pida e irrelevante que no vale la pena protestar contra ellos es una p rdida de energ a toda esa gente dedica tiempo a organizarlo dedican su pasi n incluso ponen su vida en peligro en algunos casos todo para quemar la ira para que desaparezca bueno creo que ser a mucho mejor que se quedasen en casa y se enfadasen m s y m s hasta que estuviesen los suficientemente enfadados como para hacer algo de verdad
5422170 veo a mucha gente sola en sus habitaciones delante de la pantalla o de la m quina de escribir esa es la revoluci n que esperamos perd n no eso no es una revoluci n eso es contrarrevolucionario dentro de cinco a os mucha gente estar de acuerdo ahora casi nadie me cree es una predicci n
5422171 imaginemos que durante los dos pr ximos a os escuchamos en las noticias que ha habido otro golpe de estado en ee uu y que los republicanos vuelven a estar en el poder porque han sido elegidos o porque han jugado con los ordenadores que es una posibilidad la gente ya lleva hablando de eso 20 a os o porque roban el poder de verdad creo que eso ltimo ser a lo mejor as ser a un golpe de estado de verdad y la ira iba a saltar realmente se supone que no tenemos que desear que gane bush es el demonio mis amigos me dicen que yo soy el demonio por pensar as no es que vaya a votar a los republicanos s lo digo que si pasa eso tenemos que estar preparados mi plan es empezar a hablar inmediatamente de secesi n y ver si eso nos lleva a alguna parte
5422172 me siento tan desamparado y desesperanzado con al situaci n actual del mundo francamente no creo que estas ideas puedan tener mucha influencia sobre una situaci n que implica a millones y millones de personas y trillones y trillones de d lares hay pa ses del tama o de planetas y empresas del tama o de pa ses quiero decir a d nde van a llevarnos esas ideas dulces de la revoluci n po tica en un mundo organizado sobre esos principios qu significado pueden tener esas ideas para un leproso de bombay bueno tengo que dejarlo como pregunta

5422185 this album is about feeling and i wanted to hear something that makes me feel good that has been the train of thought throughout this record and kens been really great with that

5422235 the counter culture which promoted pride in ones body earthmother ism a return to unfettered undressed nature etc and to some degree feminism a womans right to do as she wishes with her body
5422236 here on the beach the rules are supposed to be different the bleached light the proximity to raw nature puts everything at a remove there is none of the furtive dimness or spangled artificiality that signals sleaze nakedness here becomes natural healthy liberating it is to be regarded as sensual not sexual
5422237 to admire compare perhaps despair breasts in their infinite variety their moulded suspended curved beaty are extremely watchable
5422238 another reason for some women i suspect is shame and by that i mean womens fear that their bodies are not good enough for public display
5422239 the topic of how far you can wear your cossies from the beach has been canvassed by others

5422248 we all recognize now that we need to interoperate at the level of data formats and protocols and not on programming models and data types that are specific to a particular programming environment
5422249 thats the core design of the web services standards and thats what were exploiting here
5422250 we took the windows communication foundation code out of the box that comes with vista windows server 2008 the net 3 5 framework and used that with our shipping releases of code
5422251 we built an application showing these things talking to each other and we worked with microsoft to configure the security certificates and so forth but didnt do any hand coding or tweaking to get a demo to work it was out of the box code
5422252 i m born here but i discover something new every day

5422259 consider all the people you see walking down the street while talking into their phones you cant do that with an iphone
5422260 its not even clear that nokia sees competing directly with apple as its top priority
5422261 thats what theyll be saying i am baffled no one cares
5422262 when tim came to me with the idea of creating a ripleys believe it or not book on amusement parks rides and attractions it didnt take me long to agree

5422271 weve uncovered a scandal involving powerful forces in the japanese government that benefit from whaling and its not surprising they are striking back what is surprising is that these activists who are innocent of any crime would be arrested for returning whale meat that was stolen from japanese taxpayers in whose interest were these arrests made because it would appear to us that this is an intimidation tactic by the government agencies responsible for a scandal
5422272 the whaling program in the southern ocean whale sanctuary is funded by the japanese taxpayers including the greenpeace activists who have been arrested and they have a right to know who is profiting from their money
5422273 the japanese whaling program has been shamed internationally for its lack of scientific credibility now it is being shamed at home as well for trying to hide the corruption and now for taking revenge on those who have exposed it the greenpeace activists should be immediately released
5422274 id vote for labor but thats just what the terrorists want

5422369 this omission seriously jeopardizes established and promising research projects that have clear and compelling application to our armed forces as well as pioneering research for all cancers
5422370 a cancer research program designed for application to military and national security needs would invariably include a strong blood cancer research foundation
5422371 dod research on blood cancers addresses the importance of preparing for civilian and military exposure to the weapons being developed by several hostile nations and to aid in the march to more effective treatment for all who suffer from these diseases we believe that building on the foundation congress initiated over the past six years should not be abandoned and would both significantly strengthen the cdmrp and accelerate the development of all cancer treatments
5422372 through this collaboration we hope to increase the awareness of plug in hybrids demonstrate the viability of the technology and evaluate performance parameters
5422373 we believe plug in hybrid technology could play an important role in further reducing our fleet costs while addressing environmental concerns
5422374 plug in hybrid technology offers real advantages in a number of areas
5422375 in addition to higher mileage in the face of rising gasoline prices plug in hybrids produce much lower emissions and can help our nation achieve greater energy security while providing the overall performance drivers expect
5422376 this is really just the start for what we hope will be the broader use of plug in hybrids
5422377 through this collaboration with coca cola and other duke energy initiatives there will be more than a dozen plug in hybrids operating in the charlotte region in early 2008
5422378 as more people begin to see the advantages of plug in hybrids we believe market demand will increase which will encourage automakers to move forward with their plans to produce plug in hybrids commercially

5422627 you should take a day at least to read the next one give yourself time to absorb what you just read to think about it maybe even discuss it with someone whos read it too
5422628 reading a book is like making love the experience should be savored
5422629 i didnt say fucking i said making love theres a difference you know boinking and making love are two totally different things boinking is like grabbing a burger at mickey ds as opposed to a home cooked meal when youre hungry it takes care of the
5422630 okay check it out youre attracted to the book by its subject the author or maybe even the art work on the cover for whatever reason that book calls to you youre initially attracted to a man by
5422631 okay so when youre attracted to a guy what do you do you check him out from all angles inside and out to see if hes someone worth spending time with you do the same with a book you hold it in your hands caressing it studying the front cover checking out the back pausing to read the synopsis blurbs from other authors and reviewers about the book all of it meant to draw you to the book to encourage you to take the book home with you just like a mans flirting and courtship is done in hopes that youre going to take him home with you eventually you flip open the book glance at the type and size of font used in the book maybe if youre like me and touch is very important so you rub your finger tips along the paper to feel the quality of the paper youre getting to know your book like you would a lover before taking him into your body
5422632 were talking about books and how she thinks theyre like lovers
5422633 the first few chapters are foreplay and as it goes on you really get into what youre doing youre starting to lose yourself in the book the outside world is forgotten all your attention is focused on whats in front of you you fly you soar your pulse accelerates and your heart beats faster it all depends on whats in the book you take your sweet time with it you dont want it too end to quickly then finally you finish the book thats your climax the last thing you see before you close the book is the authors picture and you smile maybe you even stop and read the little blurb about him her thats like the last the deep kiss you give your lover before collapsing after the love making is over a thank you for the orgasms for the time spent worshipping your body after you close your book you lay it your lap and you just sit back and let the experience wash over you totally satisfied that the time was well spent and looking forward to it again when youre done making love you just dont hop out of his bed and into someone elses do you na man you lay back in the arms of your lover and revel in what just happened you may be a little sore a little tired but its all good and you feel peaceful reading a book for me anyway is the same way i like to give it some time before i move onto another book because if the last book was any good its going to stay with me for a bit just like a good love making session the memory and feelings still linger long after the act is done
5422634 mmm this is really good anyway thats the way its for me

5422688 once upon a time in the kingdom of new york
5422689 ive become a dad that blows me away some days because not only would i not really have predicted it i also couldnt have known how much it would become my identity or that id be ok with it when it did but when i try to conjure up a picture of my life and my sense of purpose right now im a dad and a husband but with young kids even that role is secondary seven years ago it was all about me but now it seems im defining myself most by my relationship to those i love you asked about life for us these days it is a good life my only real criticism is that it is too myopic too inward focused but i think that may be partly due to this life stage when it really is about creating the foundation for our family over the next couple of decades my hope is that we expand our sphere of influence and experience as the kids get older rather than just plodding onto the treadmill of consumption and endless soccer practices

5422696 he must be so old ive never seen anyone suffering like that oh will cant we let him out
5422697 we can help you hide at least come on we wont hurt you
5422698 the man picked up a kitchen knife and slashed himself across the wrist and groin areas before running back into the restaurant where he continued to stab himself
5422699 this happened in a matter of seconds and was obviously extremely frightening and distressing for the many customers and staff in the restaurant at the time
5422700 we had a somewhat mixed reaction from other tube travellers some people were surprised others liked it and others were appalled

5422703 my card from the queen came this morning i think i saw her deliver it on her bicycle
5422704 amazon web services provide highly reliable and elastic computing and storage resources creating a compelling cost effective deployment alternative for data integration infrastructures that have been architected with the web in mind
5422705 this creates a big design and architectural shift for a lot of developers to move from the model of writing programs that are single threaded programs to a system thats distributed and multithreaded
5422706 i think more so than learning a particular set of apis which are relatively easy or the kind of installation and management tools which frankly arent that complicated the big shift is in how developers architect these systems and thats where weve seen the big learning curve
5422707 these companies spent a lot of research and development money theyre naturally going to be upset
5422708 were a microsoft partner focused on high performance computing particularly in the financial services market and weve had a positive and successful relationship with them over the past year
5422709 the steps they take over the next year will determine whether it has an effect on the market
5422710 if microsoft should elect to make distributed caching available as its own standalone sku free of charge that does undermine the market for products of this type that are coming from vendors that have worked for years to develop and evangelize this market that has a negative effect on investment for new microsoft related technologies
5422711 microsoft has validated the importance of this technology for driving scalability of server farms and compute grids
5422712 i think the velocity api may become a de facto standard as the lowest common denominator api that everybody will support
5422713 in addition i think vendors like ourselves and our competitors will add value i know that well add value beyond those apis
5422714 managing data in memory is very core to what we do because of the performance advantages of in memory data management but its really a subset were not a caching vendor so to speak

5422720 there are laboratory studies that show treatments are very effective with youth who have mental health concerns but when we look in the real treatment world we are hard pressed to identify services that are effective
5422721 the ptpb offers a revolutionary opportunity to improve mental health services mental health professionals need to know if they are succeeding during treatment and if they are not they need to know what to change the ptpb gives them that information
5422722 providers of childrens mental health services have long expressed their frustration to the research community at the lack of a comprehensive feasible and scientifically developed set of measures for assessing process and outcome existing measures have been too time consuming too limited in the domains and perspectives assessed too costly or insufficient with regard to scientific validity
5422723 the ptpb is the first comprehensive set of measures that can be used routinely to assess process and outcomes of treatment services across multiple domains and perspectives and it meets the highest level of scientific rigor this is a landmark contribution to childrens mental health services and research
5422724 therapy isnt carpentry you cant just look at your work and determine if youve met your goals you cant get accurate feedback from the task itself so you need to collect feedback in a systematic way
5422725 use of the ptpb will provide feedback that is hard to disregard and will also insert some accountability for producing results into the mental health system that currently is not there
5422726 after years of trying to find a clinical measurement system that was both practical and valid the ptpb is both of those and more
5422727 our clinicians are getting information they are able to use to inform and enhance treatment

5422729 i feel really sorry for him having been forced into taking this step a fter having listened to more than a few soundbites of rev wrights sermons ive come to the conclusion that he is definitely not the racist devil the right tries to portray him as
5422730 i cant read his mind and i dont know his true intentions but he is a politician and based on that i will always question his motives
5422731 i hope we dont have people who will cut off their noses to spite their face obama did win with very little negative campaigning if we can keep the nations health in focus we will be okay
5422732 as an african american i would be remiss if i didnt say thanks to all americans for making what i thought impossible a reality when this all started i said that whites would never vote for a black man there is no one happier today to be so wrong about this feelings
5422733 hes not a black man hes a black man and a white man half of each last time i checked i too think its wonderful that some americans at least half i would hope are blind to race when it comes to choosing someone on their merits
5422734 this is abhorrent news for the retreat and surrender caucus that only a year ago said we were losing not only in iraq but the war on terror as well
5422735 so bush ignores american polls about him but wants you to step in line to declare victory over damascus and tehran polls about bin laden im sure they were properly monitored
5422736 according to some reports bin ladin is not only losing bin ladin is dead
5422737 granted he looks like hes been using grecian formula 44 on his beard but this is very common in the islamic world a full dark beard shows vitality apparently even if it is color by clairol
5422738 for the last several years that has been iraq and there are a whole lot less of them alive now
5422739 theres a new one born every minute who will not mind losing his life to the cause of nutcases like al zawahiri and bin laden we have turned those two clowns into heroes instead of prisoners
5422740 maybe obama will be grateful that he will have another distraction that way if he sticks his foot in his mouth it wont be reported on too much tonight
5422741 so after 8 years of listening to bush shredding grammar and the english language beyond all recognition cons suddenly want a president who can competently speak extemporaneously
5422742 five months from now i will be laughing my ass off at comments like yours what do kennedy nixon clinton daddy bush clinton dole and obama mccain have in common a young vibrant orator versus an anal retentive republican
5422743 this obviously sounds like a man who is confident relaxed experienced is intelligent has integrity has solutions that hes ready to implement and most importantly has been ready and able to assume the white house for quite some time now

5422821 ultimately as fortuny suggests trolling will stop only when its audience stops taking trolls seriously
5422822 thats wrong and we will condemn it when it occurs among us and discourage it
5422823 the solution to trolls is to stop taking them seriously
5422824 not to take it seriously by force and refashioning the internet into a totalitarian space in which only the boot on face has any validity this simply has to be resisted to say that victims of trolling need to shrug off cyber bullying and harassment is to capitulate to their evil

5422916 we expect our involvement with limo to advance these principles
5422917 this collaboration offers further concrete evidence that limo is positioned at the heart of the rapidly emerging industry wide trend to secure the benefits of openness and choice in technology
5422918 with an abundance of combined yet very different experiences and a shared commitment to medical education clinical investigation and the effort to connect patients to the very best treatments enh and the university of chicago medical center will usher in a new generation of healthcare on the north shore and beyond
5422919 the partnership takes our medical school one with a top national reputation and highly ranked programs and makes the educational experience that much stronger
5422920 both organizations have many similarities across their missions of teaching and research but we also have a variety of differences in our enterprise strategies that actually complement rather than compete with one another
5422921 health care takes place in a variety of different settings
5422922 medical schools achieve a diversity of settings by linking up with affiliates in addition to their own teaching hospitals to give students a richer variety of patient care experiences that kind of broad educational exposure is incredibly robust
5422923 one of the most important elements is the quality and excellence of the physician faculty
5422924 and enhs physician faculty are among the very best in the country
5422925 enh will oversee an expanding program to establish a health initiative in lake county il that parallels ucmcs efforts on the south side of chicago in order to improve access to quality health care in underserved areas
5422926 this was as much an outgrowth of individual teams making the decisions that made the most sense for the applications they were trying to build as anything
5422927 typically theres some sort of legacy environment mainframes and now this slew of dynamic scripting languages for web development php python ruby on rails so theres quite a bit of heterogeneity in the enterprise now
5422928 a lot of developers will have more than one language under their belts
5422929 its not uncommon but the truth is that software developers tend to be the most productive in one environment
5422930 in some cases i see these heterogeneous shops pushing their net developers toward c as opposed to vb net because its the most like java and the hope is that it will make it easier for them to transfer skills in practice though its not so much the languages that create a learning curve as the frameworks
5422931 java is largely an open source driven world and net is largely not
5422932 as much as some of us dream of a world where all the computing systems are homogeneous
5422933 the world has been is and will be running heterogeneous systems and services
5422934 the most important thing to keep in mind is that very few companies will settle on a single technology platform
5422935 therefore anything that can facilitate interoperability is very valuable the key value of tools like jnbridge and cocobase is their ability to broaden the audience for both languages so that one set of skills can play in another environment
5422936 once you layer new models such as sharepoint and ria development onto existing apps were moving toward a place where multilanguage development is going to be increasingly common
5422937 crossing the language gap will become more of an issue
5422938 bob beck was a remarkable guy who ultimately changed the way we see things that are invisible to light
5422939 he provided much of the foundation for the detection and processing of radiologic signals his work still serves as the basis for the design for many modern systems
5422940 in many ways bob set the stage for the emergence of nuclear medicine
5422941 he brought much needed rigor to the field of imaging systems in those days you almost never saw an equation in the journal of nuclear medicine but one of bobs first papers had about 50
5422942 to this day many nuclear imaging systems are based on his ideas and calculations on how collimators the devices that select and screen the raw data for single photon images perform
5422943 from high school days bob was pointed to a career in physics
5422944 but he was deeply troubled by the moral issues raised by the role of physics in the atomic bomb project
5422945 his vision and passion for nuclear medicine and imaging science have inspired our own life long commitment to research in these areas

5422961 while on a personal level i liked each of the leaders there from xpf and enjoyed interacting with them i was puzzled at the somewhat cavalier way they seemed to dismiss some of the teams concerns for example we were very proud of the fact that our team had managed to get some surplus company fuel tanks when i asked about it without much thought i was told youll have to get a ruling on that also when i asked something about our camera design a design we had worked very hard on i was told that the way we were doing it would not be allowed huh do they know how hard we have worked on this
5422962 i inwardly cringed at their responses to some of the other teams concerns they all had concerns regarding the media aspects of the rules that i did not feel were adequately addressed and maybe even more important even adequately appreciated the cumulative effect coming from the xpf leadership was one of discouragement rather than encouragement

5423055 when am i supposed to start having all these devastating problems with my heart kidneys liver and whatever else
5423056 there have been no long term studies showing low carb is safe
5423057 the way americans are going low fat is very unhealthy they have a very high glycemic load theyre taking sugar theyre taking white bread theyre taking white rice and pasta that certainly isnt the answer
5423058 doesnt mean that you should load your plate with steak and bacon
5423059 the adverse effects of animal products might be counterbalanced by reducing refined carbohydrates

5423069 since i still go back and forth quite a bit i can easily say that the two biggest benefits of static languages for me in net is the compiler crutch to catch my syntax errors and the rich rich discoverability i think the latter could maybe be addressed with dynamic languages and really smart development environments but were not there yet
5423070 but what would be really cool imho is if we could more easily switch and access dynamic language code right from within static code for those few operations when dynamic code is just easier the easy ability to define say a ruby code block and just execute it inline or via some stringbased mechanism would really allow bringing the richness of dynamic code to static languages the dlr almost has this but it stops just a little short of making this code more genericly callable

5423092 if a faction consists of less than a majority relief is supplied by the republican principle which enables the majority to defeat its sinister views by regular vote it may clog the administration it may convulse the society but it will be unable to execute and mask its violence under the forms of the constitution when a majority is included in a faction the form of popular government on the other hand enables it to sacrifice to its ruling passion or interest both the public good and the rights of other citizens to secure the public good and private rights against the danger of such a faction and at the same time to preserve the spirit and the form of popular government is then the great object to which our inquiries are directed let me add that it is the great desideratum by which this form of government can be rescued from the opprobrium under which it has so long labored and be recommended to the esteem and adoption of mankind by what means is this object attainable evidently by one of two only either the existence of the same passion or interest in a majority at the same time must be prevented or the majority having such coexistent passion or interest must be rendered by their number and local situation unable to concert and carry into effect schemes of oppression if the impulse and the opportunity be suffered to coincide we well know that neither moral nor religious motives can be relied on as an adequate control they are not found to be such on the injustice and violence of individuals and lose their efficacy in proportion to the number combined together that is in proportion as their efficacy becomes needful from this view of the subject it may be concluded that a pure democracy by which i mean a society consisting of a small number of citizens who assemble and administer the government in person can admit of no cure for the mischiefs of faction a common passion or interest will in almost every case be felt by a majority of the whole a communication and concert result from the form of government itself and there is nothing to check the inducements to sacrifice the weaker party or an obnoxious individual hence it is that such democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths theoretic politicians who have patronized this species of government have erroneously supposed that by reducing mankind to a perfect equality in their political rights they would at the same time be perfectly equalized and assimilated in their possessions their opinions and their passions

5423115 why would it matter if we put the wrong date in
5423116 if we could build web serving and database engines that were foolproof against sql injection we most definitely would
5423117 im not even sure thats feasible were getting the word out to developers that theres this problem thats part of web development
5423118 what we want to do for the industry and especially for developers on our platform is to say ok these are the things we really encourage you to do to avoid having these classes of vulnerabilities in your web sites
5423119 they get rewarded for features and speed so its no wonder they havent been focusing on this but i do believe that given the chance and the know how developers want to do the right thing
5423120 if we could build web serving and database engines that were foolproof against sql injection we most definitely would
5423121 security is now seen as an attribute of good quality code
5423122 but its not easy to build secure software and developers need help we havent found the perfect security development solution yet and personally i dont think we ever will but we can still make the process of building secure code easier for anyone developing on our platforms
5423123 the jury is out on whether developers outside the company building software for the microsoft platform will want to adopt the sdl specifications
5423124 theyve tried to make the sdl 3 2 the current iteration sort of a generic version of what theyve done internally with the microsoft specific pieces stripped out that will help but it remains to be seen how developers will respond
5423125 were working to get more information more tools and more training to outside developers
5423126 for the development community were still feeling our way to a strategy that will work but weve done a lot
5423127 application security is a very serious business today and we need to teach coders about building secure software while were teaching them to code
5423128 id like to see this stuff become part of a real computer science curriculum
5423129 first look at the sdl material and think about what it takes to make your code secure for the environment its operating in thats a fundamental the bad guys arent going away and they arent getting dumber so implement the sdl or something like it as you build code
5423130 second as youre building applications use platform services wherever you can in other words try to use the underlying system mechanisms because it seems to me that as end to end trust microsofts proposed system for securing web apps and services materializes in software over time were likely to integrate it with system facilities and other vendors will too so if youve written to the platform apis youre more likely to wind up with code thats compatible with the way things are going

5423207 weve now found that increasing the protein content of the diet augments the bodys own pyy helping to reduce hunger and aid weight loss
5423208 one potential weight loss strategy is therefore to increase the satiating power of the diet and promote weight loss through the addition of dietary protein harnessing our own satiety system

5423274 previous studies determined the maximal radiotherapy doses for single organs
5423275 but this technique has not been tested for simultaneous use on multiple organs so we designed a dose escalation trial to determine the optimal dose starting with fairly low levels and increasing the dose in later groups of patients
5423276 we have seen improved response rates with higher radiation doses without an increase in side effects yet

5423354 as one of our own alumni bill eckhardt possesses a deep appreciation for the universitys long standing multi disciplinary approach that fosters work across the boundaries of science
5423355 his gift will have a galvanizing impact on the ability of our scientists to carry out their most innovative work
5423356 we are in a time of revolutionary change in science and technology that is fundamentally altering how we understand our world the university of chicago will invest heavily to provide agenda setting leadership in fields that are on the cusp of discovery
5423357 the tremendous generosity of bill eckhardt will make a major impact on the great science done at the university
5423358 we can expect some of the most fundamental discoveries of the future to take place in the eckhardt research institutes building just as they have taken place in the research institutes since the time of enrico fermi the list of individuals who have occupied this building reads like a whos who of 20th century science and we anticipate will be the home of the leading scientists of the next century

5423366 the attitude toward open source has definitely changed in the recent past more companies are taking open source solutions seriously for mission critical situations sun might be poised to take advantage of that change
5423367 open source is core to our strategy of increasing our market penetration
5423368 it allows us to reach developers and companies that would never have thought of it before its about acquiring new customers while providing the same advantages to our existing customers its one of the big reasons we went down the open source path

5423371 discussions with microsoft regarding a potential transaction whether for an acquisition of all of yahoo or a partial acquisition have concluded
5423372 microsoft representatives stated unequivocally that microsoft is not interested in pursuing an acquisition of all of yahoo even at the price range it had previously suggested
5423373 such a transaction would not be consistent with the companys view of the converging search and display marketplaces
5423374 would leave the company without an independent search business that it views as critical to its strategic future
5423375 as stated on may 3 and reiterated on may 18 microsoft was not interested in rebidding for all of yahoo our alternative transaction remains available for discussion

5423397 interoperability is a critical issue for the commission and usage of well established open standards is a key factor to achieve and endorse it
5423398 the commission must do its part it must not rely on one vendor it must not accept closed standards and it must refuse to become locked into a particular technology jeopardizing maintenance of full control over the information in its possession
5423399 the truth is theyll probably love voting for him obama but after what they feel has been done to them the way in which they were written off marginalized and resented their hopes mocked and their history making ambitions dismissed as retrograde identity politicking damned if theyre going to be nice girls about it

5423406 count all the votes including all the votes from michigan florida and both the texas and washington state caucuses and primaries
5423407 but as recent weeks have made clear barack obama is the most split personality politician in the country today on the one hand there is dr barack the high minded niebuhr quoting speechifier who spent this past winter thrilling the scarlett johansson set and feeling the fierce urgency of now but then on the other side theres fast eddie obama the promise breaking tough minded chicago pol whod throw you under the truck for votes this guy is the whole chicago package an idealistic lakefront liberal fronting a sharp elbowed machine operator hes the only politician of our lifetime who is underestimated because hes too intelligent he speaks so calmly and polysyllabically that people fail to appreciate the machiavellian ambition inside but hes been giving us an education for anybody who cares to pay attention just try to imagine mister rogers playing the agent ari in entourage and it all falls into place

5423414 great podcast as usual i loved your message to restauranteurs they are only hurting themselves by ignoring low carbers cause we arent going anywhere keep up the great work jimmy
5423415 another well done show this episode was very meaty no pun intended and presented very well i am so glad to hear that low carb meus are still out there and that the consumer is being heard
5423416 i just listened to your latest podcast and the main thing that occurred to me is the fact that each podcast is getting better and better you are learning and improving with each one this one had a very professional quality feel about it and i was impressed what i liked most about the podcast is finding out that half of the survey participants whether they realize it or not are trying to follow at least some of the bullet point items of low carb like reducing or eliminating sugar and other unhealthy carbs i wonder how many of those people would then turn around and say that low carb is an unhealthy fad diet
5423417 i look forward to these podcasts new info about low carb that i would not be aware of if it wasnt for jimmys research he is truly a great teacher of the lifestyle
5423418 excellent show this week and congratulations on landing chocoperfection as a sponsor thanks for pointing out the results of those surveys i get frustrated when restaurants and grocery stores stop carrying low carb friendly items because the low carb craze is over keep up the good work
5423419 jimmy i love your podcasts what i liked most about the podcast is the affirmation that the low carb way of life is not just a fad or a even a diet it truly is a way of life that has allowed me to lose almost 50 pounds in 6 months i still have about 30 pounds to go but i know ill get there if im steadfast and unwavering in my determination to succeed i cant tell you what i liked least about the podcast because there wasnt anything that i didnt like it was informative and entertaining and i appreciate you taking the time and making the effort to produce a podcast that inspires and motivates those of us who are livin la vida low carb

5423447 obama didnt get popular votes from all the caucus states
5423448 obama moves dnc operations to chicago in a major shakeup at the democratic national committee and a departure from tradition large parts of the committees operations are relocating to chicago to be fully integrated with the obama campaign the dncs political department housed in washington d c will be dramatically rebuilt with staffers offered a choice of moving to chicago joining state operations or staying in washington dnc spokeswoman karen finney said but the power will clearly be shifting to a centralized chicago hub the dncs key role in coordinating political operations with state parties is expected to largely be taken over and overseen by obamas senior staff in chicago state party officials said but here was the killer people familiar with the plan said that state party staffers paid for under howard deans 50 state program would be shifted to working for the presidential campaign at least in targeted battleground states thats not why i sent the money in thats not what howard dean said when he asked for the money was for 50 state organizing to build party the obama campaign is taking over the party and looting all available funds to further the ambitions of the one including money raised for a completely different purpose my goddamn money

5423559 my heart began to beat so fast that i feared it might burst through my sterum
5423560 it was a beautiful home i spent my days raising my son it was all very nice
5423561 i couldnt have done the things i did any other way robbing banks allowed me to do those things i wasnt smart enough and was too lazy to do it any other way

5423869 every addictive drug used by people is also self administered by rats and monkeys if we arrange matters so that when an animal presses a lever it gets a shot of heroin into a vein that animal will press the lever repeatedly to the exclusion of other activities food sex etc it will become a heroin addict
5423870 but humans are unfortunately more intelligent than rats and may want to do drugs for other reasons perhaps to escape from their real life problems
5423871 whats even more amazing is the most damaging and socially harmful drug of all alcohol is legal

5423883 a song that became a classic without ever having been a hit
5423884 the australian democrats have long called for 14 weeks paid maternity leave to be introduced as a basic minimum standard for all working women we recognise this is a start even a baby step and should be increased in the future
5423885 a longer period of leave at a higher level of payment is desirable and reflects pml schemes in some other industrialised nations
5423886 however my most immediate concern is to ensure that the nearly two thirds of working women who have no access to paid maternity leave are able to receive a basic safety net entitlement
5423887 women should not be forced to return to work only weeks after having a baby due to a lack of leave entitlements or financial reasons
5423888 the international labour organisation recommends a 14 week scheme of paid maternity leave for this purpose and my bill is based on this recommendation
5423889 for six and a half years i have campaigned for this basic minimum standard of paid maternity leave without support from either major party so i am well aware of the political realities at work here any higher payment or longer period of leave would be wonderful but our priority must be ensuring all women have access to at least 14 weeks paid maternity leave
5423890 we are here to do a show tonight this is where we are supposed to set up and play
5423891 i dont think so one of the dorms burnt down and this is what we are using to house the students affected
5423892 wir haben einen ganz klaren regierungsauftrag erhalten allerdings von relativ wenig w hlern 0 3 prozent sobald die endg ltigen zahlen vorliegen werden wir in aller ruhe die situation analysieren wie sich aber jetzt schon abzeichnet konnten wir unser gutes ergebnis von 2005 halten oder sogar leicht ausbauen ich danke dem landesverband hamburg und unserem spitzenkandidaten heinz strunk ganz herzlich f r den aufopferungsvollen und erfolgreichen wahlkampf ich selbst mu einen schwerwiegenden fehler einr umen es hat in den letzten tagen eine diskussion gegeben die irritationen ausgel st hat vielleicht waren meine u erungen deutschland werde auch am liechtenstein verteidigt sowie die forderung deutsche kampftruppen nicht nur in den s den dieses verkommenen zwergstaates zu schicken so kurz vor der wahl nicht wirklich hilfreich ich bedauere dies

5423898 we created the comodo forum hoping it would evolve into a strong knit community that consisted of both our customers and others interested in online security
5423899 it now attracts a diverse community including some of the brightest minds in our industry i am deeply gratified to see how community members actively support each other to help manage the every day issues people have in staying safe online this level of passionate commitment has become an integral part of comodos approach to our development across our entire business
5423900 by partnering with opera we are able to provide our customers with a true web browser which is fast robust and keeps our delivery costs under control

5423906 we have employees in fifteen countries around the world worldcom provides a simple cost effective solution for them to access our corporate information
5423907 they at amp t were torpedoed by their own marketing message
5423908 worldcoms just too good to be part of the computer industry instead of finding ways to blame the customer worldcom always responds and rapidly to investigate what needs to be done by whom and when they are an example for other companies to follow although i have doubts that large corporations will ever be able to match their dedication to customer service
5423909 the lotus notes technical discussion forums on worldcom have saved us a lot of headaches reading the forums on a regular basis has helped us to avert countless problems

5423927 a worldwide community of photographers provided valuable insight and feedback as part of the lightroom 2 public beta program ultimately helping us deliver a better product
5423928 weve considered their requests which helped us develop useful features that make it easier than ever for our customers to quickly refine enhance and present brilliant photographs
5423929 one of the big reasons why lightroom has become such a phenomenon among serious photographers is that adobe built it with the input of a very vocal user community
5423930 adobe really listens to the issues and challenges todays photographers face and theyve built a complete solution that not only meets the needs of photographers it really feels like it was made just for us the enhancements to lightroom 2 combined with the power of photoshop give photographers the ultimate freedom to produce professional images quickly

5423939 for example one of the things our market cares a lot about are social security numbers
5423940 we can secure where those go and which services are doing what with that kind of personal identity information through servicenet as the gateway for web service level requests and for https requests both inside the firewall and outside the firewall
5423941 we were moving down the path of leveraging the esb layer of our stack and looking to enforce the usual layered security model that includes all of the certificates and authentication
5423942 so we were moving down the path of having to individually secure authenticate and test a host of those services and trying to create a web services governance model internally that was proving to be potentially rather costly rather burdensome across a distributed developer base
5423943 we historically come from a microsoft vb sql web 1 0 world
5423944 now were migrating very rapidly to a web 2 0 world with an open source soa environment that features jboss app server bpm from lombardi software inc for a rules engine we like jrules from ilog inc were implementing our user interface in lazlo systems inc openlazlo using dhtml as a presentation layer we connect that layer to the backend through a set of restful web services that will pass through the servicenet gateway and have pretty fine grained security policy applied
5423945 in that environment youve got centrally evaluated rules youve got orchestrated business processes and youve got a ui layer thats very dynamic and driven by that orchestrated business process
5423946 were talking about hundreds or thousands of web services communicating in a restful state between the front and back end we see a tremendous advantage in being able to funnel those through servicenet in terms of very uniformly very predictably applying fine grained security policies
5423947 one it gives you the performance and scale the way networking devices do the other thing is the policy model is all declarative so you can have operations folks go out and make changes to the policy while a system is running if sterlings business folks want to go out and change a policy they dont have to go back to the developers to reprogram it and re compile it it happens on the fly both the performance as well as the policy model are a direct result of applying networking principles to the middleware concept
5423948 plugging in the servicenet capability relieved our developers from spending dramatic amounts of time on the web service security modeling side
5423949 we were able to just focus on proper security modeling using the graphical tools from the servicenet suite
5423950 for example one of the things our market cares a lot about are social security numbers
5423951 we can secure where those go and which services are doing what with that kind of personal identity information through servicenet as the gateway for web service level requests and for https requests both inside the firewall and outside the firewall

5423987 vreau sa vad paharele in aer cine nu bea cu noi e un fraier
5423988 eu cred si sustin cu argumente aceasta afirmatie in cartea mea ca dincolo de holocaustul impotriva evreilor a existat si un holocaust rosu caruia i au cazut victime circa 313 milioane de oameni comunismul a asasinat numai din romania circa 2 8 milioane de oameni in cartea mea pun in relatie directa comunismul si masoneria internationala cititi o si va veti convinge
5423989 exista chiar un caz celebru al unui mare istoric german actual helmuth von mollte care spune ca n ar fi existat fascismul fara procesiunea comunismului ca fascismul a fost o contrareactie la comunizarea europei
5423990 hitler spre deosebire de stalin a dus la nceput o politica economica benefica pentru germania a rezolvat problema celor sapte milioane de someri a restabilit putin demnitatea poporului german foarte umilit prin pacea de la versailles a creat locuri de munca a facut autostrazi o masina pentru popor volkswagen etc manipularea multimii prin doctrina alaturi de acoperirea monstruozitatii ma refer la lagare la aushcwitz si celelalte i au creat o oarecare popularitate legitima ce popularitate aveau lenin sau stalin care au provocat o ntreaga tragedie
5423991 nu exista america fara masoni este statul masonic ideal n nici un alt stat din lume lojile masonice nu exercita o influenta mai mare n tot ce se numeste viata politica economica financiara sociala n calatoriile mele prin toata lumea nu am vazut nici un oras n care n centrul localitatii sa fie temple masonice de rit scotian etalate precum catedralele n europa crestina am vazut la intrarea n orasul sedona din arizona pe o placa de lemn ziua si locul unde au loc ntrunirile lojii
5423992 am facut comunismul sic fiindca este foarte apropiat de ideologia masoneriei care tinde spre un guvern mondial si un stat masonic unic iar pasii catre acest stat masonic unic sunt statele unite ale americii si statele unite ale europei iar ce va urma este un guvern mondial cu dependinta politica socialista sau comunista conform ritualurilor masonice prin urmare ne ndreptam spre un guvern mondial care nu va avea alaturi biserica n calitate de sfatuitor ne ndreptam catre un stat care tinde catre distrugerea natiunilor a familiei si a religiei

5424071 i became fascinated with the culture after visiting vietnam for a conference and after adopting my daughters
5424072 i wanted to combine my personal and professional interests and the need for research based mental health services in vietnam gave me the perfect opportunity
5424073 our ultimate goal is to permanently increase research capacity in vietnam to develop culturally appropriate research based treatments for childrens mental health problems
5424074 our work with our vietnamese colleagues will increase their ability to plan design and conduct intervention trials to evaluate these treatments and to share their results to improve mental health services
5424075 the stigma associated with mental health concerns in vietnam is even greater than in western countries
5424076 we are hoping to help people understand that mental health problems can result from ones life circumstances and that the habits you develop about what you think affects what you do and feel were also starting a dialogue that moves away from characterizing issues such as drug abuse as social evils and frames them more as mental health problems
5424077 most clinicians in vietnam have little or no training people have good trying to address a social need but they are setting up clinics with no training and no basis for judging their effectiveness
5424078 as a result some treatments likely are completely lacking in efficacy the governmental drug addiction treatment system for example has been estimated to have a 90 to 100 percent failure rate
5424079 the people we train will be remembered one day as the forefathers and mothers of vietnamese clinical psychology
5424080 it is a tremendous opportunity for these individuals and for vanderbilt to have a lasting positive impact on global health
5424081 with their barbed wire topped walls these camps bear an uncanny resemblance to prisons
5424082 we were approached by local authorities to set up a drug treatment program in collaboration with the danang psychiatric hospital
5424083 almost all of the research on drug abuse and prevention has been conducted in western countries yet much of the worlds drug addiction problem exists in collectivist countries where there are quite different challenges
5424084 in vietnam young adults stay with their parents until they marry usually around age 25 and they are still under their parents authority culturally one of the discipline techniques parents use is shame and the threat of humiliation which can inadvertently lead to an increase in drug use
5424085 young people also often have unrealistic expectations they come back from the camps expecting their families to unconditionally welcome and trust them which is not realistic given the cultural embarrassment the family has experienced both sides need help balancing their expectations and that is one of the things our program is working to do
5424086 the collaborative relationships with the vietnamese researchers will give us long term opportunities to share and learn perspective on human behavior from a significantly different culture
5424087 as members of the most affluent and most privileged country in history we feel we have a moral imperative to assist in reversing the brain drain in mental health resources
5424088 the world health organization has reported the inequity in the distribution of mental health resources in the world is unfathomably large and as a faculty member at vanderbilt it is both an honor and a moral imperative to try to help address this inequity

5424094 dwindling water supplies looms as a major disaster on our nations horizon
5424095 in an effort to protect the country from an impending water scarcity crisis the committee has begun to search out ways for the federal government to spur new technological innovations in water research and development
5424096 many experts are starting to see water as the new oil in terms of what a precious commodity it is the key to avoiding future scarcity is more efficient use reuse and distribution we need the best minds tackling this challenge and then we need to ensure the information is readily available to the public

5424107 the cause of rising gas prices is another debate but one thing we all agree on is that we must take action to help reduce the cost of transportation for families across the country
5424108 we can reduce fuel consumption and promote sustainability through changes to the transportation infrastructure
5424109 the committee on science and technology plans to play an important role in defining our transportation research priorities for the future
5424110 sustainability and energy efficiency are no longer just buzzwords in the transportation community they are crucial components of a working national transportation infrastructure building more roads is not the answer we must use our resources carefully and wisely and that requires a commitment to reducing the creation of new materials and cutting fuel use

5424180 i have nothing to say against scoring system or gojans strategy i guess i would have done the same and protected the lead had i been in his place
5424181 boxing may be a four round game but fortunes are made in the first two rounds and once you manage to take a lead its all about protecting the lead gojan didnt do anything wrong

5424189 i believe firmly that the anglican communion is going to continue by gods grace and divine providence but we do have problems
5424190 what we sought to do was find a mechanism that would redefine the basic tenets of anglicanism and call the members of the communion across the world to rally around who we are and what we stand for
5424191 we have no legal framework no magisterium that says you have had your discussion this is it
5424192 did not even think about going a legalistic or contract route
5424193 our covenant is founded on a principle of mutual cooperation we see it as a pilgrimage and all anglicans are on this pilgrimage we are seeking a mechanism to ease this pilgrimage
5424194 we are trying to reflect the views of bishops and provinces rather than the views of the covenant design group
5424195 you do not fear friends but in order to become friends we all need to get out of our boundaries our safe zones and explore the wider world out there we often look at things or people beyond ourselves as threatening as enemies when we do travel to other countries or cultures we often find that those people have the same needs and aspirations as we do and we become friends

5424208 harmful algal blooms can cause a tremendous amount of damage through the production of toxins and by reducing oxygen in the water many of our coastal areas and the great lakes are experiencing the impacts of these blooms these impacts include alteration of the oceans food web human illnesses and economic losses to coastal communities and commercial fisheries
5424209 the research and response needs for the u s have grown since the last reauthorization of the harmful algal bloom and hypoxia research and control act in 2004 there has been an increase in the number frequency and type of habs in recent years
5424210 we need to use the advances in our understanding of these blooms to better predict their occurrence and prevent them if possible fishery and beach closures are very costly events that can devastate the economies of coastal communities

5424232 to tell the truth i suspect that readers who can compare translations and originals actually tend to be worse judges of the quality of a translation than people who are unable to read the original

5424247 the pursuit of freedom as defined in an age of consumerism has induced a condition of dependence on imported goods on imported oil and on credit the chief desire of the american people is that nothing should disrupt their access to these goods that oil and that credit the chief aim of the u s government is to satisfy that desire which it does in part of through the distribution of largesse here at home and in part through the pursuit of imperial ambitions abroad
5424248 weve spent so many resources and so much attention on iraq that weve lost sight of future threats down the road the current conflict between russia and georgia is a perfect example

5424257 ok im not sure will have to ask my boss
5424258 its all contingent on the census because essentially when you have new data presuming they dont change the parameters for urbanized areas areas that have grown can be added into those urbanized areas
5424259 the urbanized area that darlington county is a member of falls short of the city of darlington
5424260 im not sure but essentially with the city of darlington what could happen is the s c department of health and environmental control can say that darlington touches a portion of a ms4 and if the citys population increases decide to add it to the ms4 because of that closeness to the boundary
5424261 the federal government doesnt want the epa or dhec taking care of everyones problems they want jurisdictions taking care of the problems theyve created
5424262 ms4 will have anything to do with land planning and stormwater
5424263 when you have a permit and a specific place to look its easy but when you start chasing water in ditches and sources in the woods it gets kind of difficult
5424264 we have realized that it might come a lot quicker but we have been working toward a stormwater utility plan for the past four years and we hope to have that program by this time next year
5424265 we were already concerned about the flooding and our drainage systems but a secondary part of the plan which is becoming very very important each day is the water quality element
5424266 the ms4 is a very unique and individual program on its own because every source of runoff from parking lots to houses and construction sites have to be monitored
5424267 drafting and enforcing ms4 standards would be very difficult to do successfully and certainly the epa and dhec understand that but the requirements are still there
5424268 men will fight in a battle and lose a battle for a cause they believe in even if the battle is lost the cause may come back and prevail this time changed and under a different name thus there may well come to be something like our semantic web but it may not be the one we have worked all these years to build if we do not rise to the occasion before us right now
5424269 those are the days i walk into the office and everybody just ducks for cover because then i micromanage everything
5424270 you get very used to being busy and almost addicted to that pace
5424271 so you try to recreate it in the slow times when its not the best use of that time
5424272 the biggest time management mistake people make is not knowing how much time they waste
5424273 the legato work is where you can distinguish yourself as a business and as an entrepreneur
5424274 and the slow periods are ideal times for this stuff if you plan in advance
5424275 youre not just initiating something new but youre also following through on something that happened when you were busy
5424276 avoid the temptation of letting networking sales efforts brainstorming and processes slide when things are really hopping
5424277 if you have an unanticipated slow period you turn right to that section and theres your list of projects
5424278 once you get into a flow youre better off staying in it than going in and out
5424279 if youre doing relationship networking calls do a bunch of them in a row
5424280 the least productive thing i can ever imagine doing is sitting in front of my computer and clicking get mail
5424281 if congress were to revise no child left behind to encourage more transfers of poor students to middle class schools would poor students drag down their better off peers in the end the prospects of class based integration will probably rise or fall on the answer to this question socioeconomic integration may be good for the have nots but if the haves think their kids are paying too great a price they will kill it off at the polls richard kahlenberg argues that the key is to ensure there is a solidly middle class majority at as many schools as possible that majority will then set the tone he argues kahlenberg says that more research is needed to pin down the percentage of middle class kids that a school needs to have to serve all its students well maybe a school can go as high as 50 percent low income without losing ground

5424365 the excitement energy and interest that exists within our church for mission
5424366 the world we live in is substantially different from the one in which many of us grew up it we look at the generation of australians aged under 35 well see that
5424367 their business is the same work of proclamation nurturing loving transforming and sustaining creation that we all strive to do but they operate differently because they are tuned to a culture that works lives and plays differently from our own they are geared to reaching people that our churches cant reach
5424368 for all those centuries we have been in christendom mode we have thought of ourselves as a pastoral church caring for a christian nation now that christendom is dying we must become a missionary church to a post christian culture or we die
5424369 if the proposals espoused by candidate obama ever became law the american economy would suffer a serious setback
5424370 this would almost surely mark the onset of a recession
5424371 in an effort to resuscitate demand the fed immediately cuts the federal funds rate bringing it 2 percentage points below the status quo level over the next year and one half despite this output growth remains well below trend over that period putting downward pressure on inflation as slack in the economy increases
5424372 tax increases appear to have a very large sustained and highly significant negative impact on output and that tax cuts have very large and persistent positive output effects
5424373 creating jobs is at the center of almost every one of barack obamas economic policies his energy plan would help to create up to 5 million green jobs through investments designed to help make sure that the next set of green industries that we know are coming happen right here in the united states

5424397 a digital circuit needs wire in order to transmit signals to different parts of the circuit the wire in a visual representation of a digital circuit is part of the drawing itself which can be perceived only in two ways
5424398 an input to a digital circuit is a zero or one similarly an input to a visual version of the circuit is an unambiguous cue to the tilt at that part of the circuit
5424399 visually represented not gates flip a boxs perceived tilt as you work through a circuit and or gates are designed with transparency cues so that the elicited perception is always that the box is tilted toward you unless overridden
5424400 the and gate is similarly designed with transparency cues but contrary to the or gate it will always favor the perception that it is tilted away from you

5424427 just the place for a snark i have said it twice that alone should encourage the crew just the place for a snark i have said it thrice what i tell you three times is true
5424428 but his courage is perfect and that after all is the thing that one needs with a snark
5424429 whats the good of mercators north poles and equators tropics zones and meridian lines
5424430 other maps are such shapes with their islands and capes but weve got our brave captain to thank
5424431 that hes bought us the best a perfect and absolute blank
5424432 we have sailed many months we have sailed many weeks four weeks to the month you may mark but never as yet tis your captain who speaks have we caught the least glimpse of a snark
5424433 we have sailed many weeks we have sailed many days seven days to the week i allow but a snark on the which we might lovingly gaze we have never beheld till now
5424434 come listen my men while i tell you again the five unmistakable marks by which you may know wheresoever you go the warranted genuine snarks
5424435 let us take them in order the first is the taste which is meagre and hollow but crisp like a coat that is rather too tight in the waist with a flavour of will o the wisp
5424436 its habit of getting up late youll agree that it carries too far when i say that it frequently breakfasts at tea and dines on the following day
5424437 the third is its slowness in taking a jest should you happen to venture on one it will sigh like a thing that is deeply distressed and it always looks grave at a pun
5424438 the fourth is its fondness for bathing machines which it constantly carries about and believes that they add to the beauty of scenes a sentiment open to doubt
5424439 the fifth is ambition it next will be right to describe each particular batch distinguishing those that have feathers and bite and those that have whiskers and scratch
5424440 if it once becomes dark theres no chance of a snark we have hardly a minute to waste
5424441 and proceed without further remark to the day when you took me aboard of your ship to help you in hunting the snark
5424442 a dear uncle of mine after whom i was named
5424443 if your snark be a snark that is right fetch it home by all means you may serve it with greens and its handy for striking a light
5424444 you may seek it with thimbles and seek it with care
5424445 but oh beamish nephew beware of the day if your snark be a boojum for then you will softly and suddenly vanish away and never be met with again
5424446 it is this it is this that oppresses my soul when i think of my uncles last words and my heart is like nothing so much as a bowl brimming over with quivering curds
5424447 let me say it once more it is this it is this that i dread
5424448 i engage with the snark every night after dark in a dreamy delirious fight i serve it with greens in those shadowy scenes and i use it for striking a light
5424449 but if ever i meet with a boojum that day in a moment of this i am sure i shall softly and suddenly vanish away and the notion i cannot endure
5424450 if only youd spoken before its excessively awkward to mention it now with the snark so to speak at the door
5424451 we should all of us grieve as you well may believe if you never were met with again but surely my man when the voyage began you might have suggested it then
5424452 its excessively awkward to mention it now as i think ive already remarked
5424453 you may charge me with murder or want of sense we are all of us weak at times but the slightest approach to a false pretence was never among my crimes
5424454 i said it in hebrew i said it in dutch i said it in german and greek but i wholly forgot and it vexes me much that english is what you speak
5424455 but now that youve stated the whole of your case more debate would be simply absurd
5424456 you shall hear when ive leisure to speak it but the snark is at hand let me tell you again tis your glorious duty to seek it
5424457 to seek it with thimbles to seek it with care to pursue it with forks and hope to threaten its life with a railway share to charm it with smiles and soap
5424458 for the snarks a peculiar creature that wont be caught in a commonplace way do all that you know and try all that you dont not a chance must be wasted to day
5424459 for england expects i forbear to proceed tis a maxim tremendous but trite and youd best be unpacking the things that you need to rig yourselves out for the fight
5424460 should we meet with a jubjub that desperate bird we shall need all our strength for the job
5424461 two added to one if that could but be done
5424462 i think the thing must be done i am sure the thing shall be done bring me paper and ink the best there is time to procure
5424463 taking three as the subject to reason about a convenient number to state we add seven and ten and then multiply out by one thousand diminished by eight
5424464 the result we proceed to divide as you see by nine hundred and ninety two then subtract seventeen and the answer must be exactly and perfectly true
5424465 the method employed i would gladly explain while i have it so clear in my head if i had but the time and you had but the brain but much yet remains to be said
5424466 in one moment ive seen what has hitherto been enveloped in absolute mystery and without extra charge i will give you at large a lesson in natural history
5424467 as to temper the jubjubs a desperate bird since it lives in perpetual passion its taste in costume is entirely absurd it is ages ahead of the fashion
5424468 but it knows any friend it has met once before it never will look at a bribe and in charity meetings it stands at the door and collects though it does not subscribe
5424469 you boil it in sawdust you salt it in glue you condense it with locusts and tape still keeping one principal object in view to preserve its symmetrical shape
5424470 this amply repays all the wearisome days we have spent on the billowy ocean
5424471 fudge that statute is obsolete quite let me tell you my friends the whole question depends on an ancient manorial right
5424472 the fact of desertion i will not dispute but its guilt as i trust is removed so far as relates to the costs of this suit by the alibi which has been proved
5424473 leave him here to his fate it is getting so late
5424474 we have lost half the day any further delay and we shant catch a snark before night
5424475 it is high time employers stopped complaining about our lazy teens and started showing them the same respect they would render an adult

5424479 and the state will wither away and well all live in a post hierarchical paradise arguments im so far from believing that that i didnt even see the resonance til i started fielding questions from people who had read the title but not the book
5424480 how will institutions who have to accept non institutional competitors react and adapt
5424481 virtualization evidently i dont care about it but i can see that the community does
5424482 whatever is both on the communitys mind and is in line with the better nature of the work
5424483 change food and beverage advertising to children in support of parental efforts to promote healthy lifestyles
5424484 this is a shameless attempt to cash in on the indiana jones film to sell burgers to children its completely inconsistent with their claims to support childrens health
5424485 this promotion shows just how little we can believe the food industrys claims that they can be trusted to self regulate childrens diets are in crisis and we need the government to step in to protect children from junk food marketing
5424486 this deal is a seedy attempt by burger king to appeal directly to our kids to repeatedly visit burger king and undermines parental attempts to encourage a balanced diet
5424487 giving away a wide range of toys encourages children to return to burger king again and again and collect the set encouraging regular repeat visits to your restaurants will contribute to the current diet related health crisis as you know promotions to children play an important part in shaping their food preferences and encouraging regular visits does not promote a balanced diet

5424493 after much soul searching and discussion with those closest to me i have decided the time is right to take a sabbatical from public life i will serve out the remainder of my term and plan to remain an active contributor to republican causes but will not run for office in 2008
5424494 i have not yet decided what opportunities to pursue when i depart congress but its clear to me that returning to the private sector and reacquainting myself with that view of the world is the best move for me and my family
5424495 i am confident we will keep this seat in republican hands voters in the 11
5424496 i want to emphasize that i am not closing the door on future public service but after 29 years in office winning 11 elections i think it is time for a respite
5424497 in normal eye movements 3 cranial nerves control 6 eye muscles which control the movement of each eye horizontally up and down or at an angle in drs miswiring between the muscles and the nerves can cause some eye muscles to contract when they should not and other eye muscles not to contract when they should this typically occurs around the sixth week of pregnancy when the cranial nerves and eye muscles develop during this time the mutations of the gene of chn1 have now been shown to explain the pathophysiology of the drs disorder
5424498 i have been very fortunate to be part of a very fruitful international interdisciplinary collaboration that resulted in a high impact paper reporting the findings of the gene responsible for an important yet rare eye disorder that affects children i look forward to more collaboration of this calibre in the very vibrant environment of the university of aberdeen

5424527 leave aside for a moment the critics who recoil at the symbols the patriarchy the very use of the term purity with its shadow of stains and stigma
5424528 only one of those boys is a hermit thrush but its still a very cute photo
5424529 the pursuit of freedom as defined in an age of consumerism has induced a condition of dependence on imported goods on imported oil and on credit the chief desire of the american people is that nothing should disrupt their access to these goods that oil and that credit the chief aim of the u s government is to satisfy that desire which it does in part of through the distribution of largesse here at home and in part through the pursuit of imperial ambitions abroad
5424530 weve spent so many resources and so much attention on iraq that weve lost sight of future threats down the road the current conflict between russia and georgia is a perfect example
5424531 the threat always drives procurement it doesnt matter what party is in office
5424532 poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict

5424538 the learned professor asad abukhalil points us to a key passage in
5424539 rendere gli incroci pi sicuri di assoluta priorit per ridurre gli incidenti e i decessi a loro connessi
5424540 le ricerche mostrano che il 40 di tutti gli incidenti ed il 20 di tutte le fatalit a questi connesse sono concentrati proprio negli incroci ed il numero destinato a salire con laumentare in termini di dimensioni e di popolazione dei centri urbani
5424541 molte delle nuove tecnologie sono costosissime e forniscono minimi benefici
5424542 gli incroci intelligenti sono diversi non solo mi aspetto che salvino numerose vite ma che permettano anche di risparmiare benzina e tempo spesi nel traffico poich pi del 50 degli ingorghi dovuto alla presenza di incidenti stradali

5424545 a number of people have alerted me in the last 24 hours that a microsoft project called sandcastle located on codeplex used the ms pl license and called itself open source yet never posted the source code
5424546 this is unacceptable and represents a violation of microsofts open source policy i take it extremely seriously
5424547 i apologize to the osi on behalf of microsoft for this mistake
5424548 our policy regarding use of the term open source is clear open source refers to projects using osi approved licenses

5424623 i am very appreciative of this action by tsa and i know the students are these students who are some of the most talented oceanographic students in the world had no idea what impact such a determination would have on their future ability to travel or work
5424624 these students need to be able to conduct their research without unnecessary restrictions
5424625 tsa permits numerous non immigrants to obtain twics including foreign students at various maritime academies foreign crewmen treaty traders and investors some business visitors persons coming in under nafta and australians in specialty occupations
5424626 it appears that these students are no different that the foreign maritime students who are already eligible for twics but tsa has not extended this right to other foreign students with similar proven needs to access u s ports
5424627 i hope that mit and the other universities with oceanographic programs and research ships are able to work with tsa to give these students the access they need to carry out their studies and research

5424644 i guess the solution is to never go off the diet
5424645 this campaign is not intended to put a downer on the event nor is it going to solve all the problems on the roads what it is hoped to achieve is to bring a widespread awareness of road safety to the thousands of revellers expected at the event we cannot ignore the fact that 80 000 people are expected on the roads to and from this event
5424646 this type of campaign is being used because its real and its harsh and i hope it will have an affect on peoples attitude when taking to the road while i believe that statistics are essential in determining road safety factors i personally hate referring to road deaths as numbers and statistics because all these figures mean absolutely nothing to the families partners and friends of the hundreds of people that are being killed on the roads every year if this campaign will save just one life on the roads then our efforts and the deaths of these four young people have not been in vain

5425005 the ilog acquisition goes a long way in rounding out ibms bpm enabled by soa vision
5425006 business rules were the missing piece and ilog fills the gap nicely products from the two vendors were already working together in many clients so this acquisition makes sense both for customers as well as for the vendors involved
5425007 ibms acquisition of ilog is nothing but good for ibm
5425008 it deepens and strengthens for ibm a critical area of technology infrastructure for business flexibility and business optimization ibm has many opportunities and therefore challenges to extend its leverage of ilogs feature function across its platforms including websphere tivoli and lotus in particular
5425009 sure ilogs products will be yet one more complexity in ibms massive product portfolio prompting many to joke yet again about ibm software products coming with a slew of consultants in the box
5425010 but youd have the same product integration challenges if you bought any other rules engine separately from your application soa platform
5425011 if were going to talk about moving soa into the next phase and that is event driven architecture we need to have a discussion of how soa and bpm practitioners can better work together and how their tools can better interoperate
5425012 eda requires the ability to process events as they are entered into the workflow this is clearly top of mind for ibm as well this is positioning for soa 2010
5425013 rules play a central role because rules can be employed in a number of different capacities that are all very closely intertwined
5425014 for example i can use a rules engine to define rules for my runtime governance for runtime governance im using rules to make sure i can respond to events in the application infrastructure i can use a rule engine to define and control how developers create business processes i can use the same rules engine for developers doing web services composition to make sure slas are defined make sure different data sources are correctly utilized
5425015 what ibm is setting themselves up to do is provide that centralized repository of rules for an application that works with tivoli on the runtime side and works with their bpm suite on the design time and runtime for bpm and on the build time with rational too

5425212 the pursuit of freedom as defined in an age of consumerism has induced a condition of dependence on imported goods on imported oil and on credit the chief desire of the american people is that nothing should disrupt their access to these goods that oil and that credit the chief aim of the u s government is to satisfy that desire which it does in part of through the distribution of largesse here at home and in part through the pursuit of imperial ambitions abroad
5425213 weve spent so many resources and so much attention on iraq that weve lost sight of future threats down the road the current conflict between russia and georgia is a perfect example
5425214 the threat always drives procurement it doesnt matter what party is in office
5425215 poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict

5425222 your ballroom days are over baby night is drawing near shadows of the evening crawl across the years
5425223 nato is perceived by russia and very justifiably so in my opinion as being simply a vehicle for the us to advance its interests by threatening and encircling russia
5425224 there are far more far smarter and more realistic ways to address security concerns than belligerence military aggression war and missiles
5425225 do you not see that the attempt to denude russia of its historical provinces is a provocation that stands as a prelude to war
5425226 get your head out of the ethnic grudge book and take a look around
5425227 no i would not want the heirs of the duchy of muscovy telling me what to do if i were in the shoes of any people who had been abused by the ambitions of that ancient imperial state i think we will all grant that but that is not the issue here
5425228 if your argument is sincere you are naive chris seemed to think your argument was disingenuous which is it
5425229 there are other serious problems with carsons stances he seems to revel in victim avenging the way the far right israelis do when they talk about the holocaust implying that it is their right to get revenge and to be as bloody as necessary
5425230 he also makes a mistake when he advances that joining nato will make georgia safe
5425231 other problems regard his knowledge of the situation of kosovo contrary to what he claims muslims were not simply victims
5425232 then carson makes a very wild claim this one brutal repression from several years ago a repression that is over in a country that is supposed to be safe in the hands of the un troops peacekeepers makes it necessary now for kosovo to be declared an independant state again this shows an utter lack of knowledge about the reality of the situation as well as a serious problem in the logic department
5425233 i do not know all the events the number of dead people or the chronology
5425234 if kosovo must be declared independent it is most assuredly not because muslims oughta have a safe place to live it is rather to be in tune with the victim avenging dogma that carson and so many others fall for
5425235 unless of course you actually mean that serbs are bloody killers who just could never coexist with muslims
5425236 why should we outright discard its decisions and instead focus on what people in the neighboring countries want they are puppets and proxies to the us this is how they are considered this is not how we consider them
5425237 why should we outright discard its decisions and instead focus on what people in the neighboring countries want
5425238 kosovos independence was made necessity by ethnic cleansing by serbs the georgians havent been ethnic cleansing in south ossettia two different cases and one set of muslims who evidently dont count
5425239 i and the others i believe call naive anyone who thinks the us places value on these countries
5425240 well i did not feel i was telling them what to do but rather i gave my opinion on what they should do if they wanted peace
5425241 i dont know enough about the history of those attacks you constantly talk about
5425242 go back to the interventionist crowd and leave us alone
5425243 a decent thinker will assess everyones concerns instead of assigning the bad guy role to one so as to focus only on the other
5425244 you simply compared them to bullying parents and implied that they could not help but bully kill muslims therefore making it impossible to give them a state
5425245 when i said i did not know all the facts the number of dead people and the chronology of the events that wasnt an admission of ignorance but a simple attempt at humility if you crush even this with condescension do not expect others to reply to you
5425246 youd like to paint me as an empty critic if thats your aim refute the 10 points i made about your posts
5425247 1 its all lies 2 its all ideological fluff 3 its troglodytic prurience of the type that gets the hawks all excited 4 its a cheap rehash of joe mccarthy via bill oreilly

5425308 in my view criticizing something for being passive aggressive is like faulting a tactic for being discreet just as there are times when subtlety is the worst approach there are also times when passive aggression is the best
5425309 in fact the more i talked to friends about similar experiences sometimes in dealing with roommates or neighbors but most often in dealing with larger and faceless adversaries the more i realized that passive aggression is actually the vehicle for a noteworthy array of scrappy ingenuity

5425344 anything that is living people are starting to consider to use for biofuels
5425345 some algae makes a lot of oil those are the ones used to make biodiesel there are other types of algae which make a lot of sugar and those are used for potentially making ethanol
5425346 the idea came about around 50 years ago the federal government funded research on it for 18 years they invested about 25 million in researching it
5425347 but now that oil is more expensive there is renewed interest in using it to produce biofuels

5425398 this subcommittee has been the strongest champion of nist in congress and its members have spent a lot of time educating our colleagues about the outstanding scientific and technical work of nist employees
5425399 however along with scientific and technical excellence must be an equal dedication to safe laboratory practices this is especially true at nist where staff routinely work with hazardous materials and high powered equipment such as radioactive material and lasers
5425400 i am very disappointed that we are all here today this incident never should have occurred in the first place
5425401 and i am far from satisfied with nists response both initially and as the situation has continued to develop the apparent lack of an acceptable emergency response plan and clearly inadequate protocols for handling toxic materials are just the first of many serious problems that nist must resolve
5425402 i am concerned that the laser event did not trigger an immediate review of all of nists safety training which might have prevented the accident in june
5425403 the purpose of todays hearing is not to place blame it is to understand how this situation developed and what needs to be done to instill a culture of safety in the nist labs while maintaining scientific excellence

5425414 miami itself was strong in music back in the seventies with groups like kc and the sunshine band
5425415 flo rida was my hype man awhile ago that s when i was doing the chinaman solo thing back when we were coming up we were fighting for the south now the south is holding its own the hottest rappers right now are all from the south it makes you proud

5425418 look at all the big songs that 2 live crew had
5425419 luke was just the hype man the group was not luke he is nowhere on the hits look at all the songs he wasnt a rapper he just chanted the hooks to get crowd participation he wanted us to do the music for his upcoming reality show but he wants to call it luke featuring 2 live crew
5425420 lots of times the group got categorized by uncle luke with some of the ways that he handled business how he did stuff onstage and so forth
5425421 we as rappers were doing one thing and he was trying to take it to the extreme

5425468 that if every small town had an annual festival held in the environs of a historic building with ample patio space under some of the first sunshine of the early spring where you could relaxedly catch up with the locals while gawking at the out of towners grilled brat in hand you might not even need the beer to make it worthwhile
5425469 we had nothing about this at the city no police report nothing as the years went by i guess the incident disappeared
5425470 it didnt change the fact that he died in the line of duty
5425471 the circumstances of why he died maybe explains why the story was buried pushed aside it was a terrible accident
5425472 i knew it would be some work even before i started looking into the death
5425473 but i figured that if he did really exist and truly did give his life for his community he deserves to be recognized and not forgotten
5425474 the stone was so old that the writing was fading

5425532 this year saw the purchase of a lot of new gear studio cameras video switcher graphics generator and weather presentation and ajas fs1 converter is the glue that keeps all of that working together
5425533 we get feeds from a variety of sources satellite network and everything else you can think of and the fs1 can handle it all
5425534 we instantly started referring to the fs1 as our can opener because it does everything
5425535 the fs1 allows us to do just about anything we can up convert down convert add wings and even translate in closed caption which is huge sometimes well get incoming feeds that are not in hd and when they go out on air they either have to be in hd or be closed captioned the fs1 allows us to cross convert the captioning up to hd and from hd down to sd its all built into the same box and all for one price
5425536 the wiring is relatively simple we were able to mount them on a studio rack cable them up and lock them to our in house sync generator with no problems whats more ajas customer service is incredibly responsive and the few questions we did have were all answered within a couple of hours the fs1 is a reasonably priced box offering all around usefulness such as embedded audio analog and decoding that in other systems would require multiple boxes and thats a very big deal

5425565 jason has outstanding credentials and the life experiences necessary to succeed as a public official
5425566 he hasnt worked a solid year for an employer in his entire life
5425567 my focus is on jasons life experience to date not on his military service
5425568 personally i think that each week of that service counts for a whole lot of years serving as a lobbyist in some booth in jefferson city dont you agree
5425569 volunteered my time to help jason kander on his campaign
5425570 we can afford to differ on the currency the tariff and foreign policy but we cannot afford to differ on the question of honesty if we expect our republic permanently to endure honesty is not so much a credit as an absolute prerequisite to efficient service to the public unless a man is honest we have no right to keep him in public life it matters not how brilliant his capacity the weakling and the coward cannot be saved by honesty alone but without honesty the brave and able man is merely a civic wild beast who should be hunted down by every lover of righteousness no man who is corrupt no man who condones corruption in others can possibly do his duty by the community
5425571 diana diana kander steve steven bough and the rest of the crew i applaud him jason very much for his service which is not the question here what the others are concerned about and for good reason is that this blog and hda are nothing more than ways to raise his profile for a race where he has obviously made his intentions very apparent if during visits home or after this tour he is trying to garner support for his run then these fears are well founded let us just see if http www jasonkander com ends up a campaign website or pointing to one for it s creator in 2 years that said i applaud him for the service and wish him a safe tour and return
5425572 in reading the comments i want to stress that i have no knowledge that anyone is planning on resorting to third party committees thus if you read my post to imply that coffman or spence has already picked up the ice pick then my phrasing was misleading no offense intended

5425574 now by the way the rumors are that amy has picked up the ice pick

5425576 i know what an honorable discharge is but holy cow did you read that evaluation
5425577 id love to see where ive ever told a lie on this blog because i havent
5425578 obviously the military appreciates jasons service much more than you do
5425579 slink away from my assertion that jason was somehow hiding his national guard service i still believe that to be the true two of my friends that served in the national guard are pretty bothered by the omission on his campaign site
5425580 all this stuff about jasons military career is funny because jason himself doesnt make that big a deal of it

5425643 also the combination of affordability and lack of an exclusive closed creative arts scene i lived in philly for about 12 years its a good city to mess up a lot in and experience all of your early 20s meltdowns
5425644 in the situational application world its about the non technical people who say i know what i want and i want to quickly assemble the relevant information for me
5425645 exploit standards and web based technology to gain access to information
5425646 a single view of disparate sets of information in a highly re usable manner
5425647 demand for mashup capabilities is being driven by the business users who want easier access to enterprise data
5425648 mashups hold the promise of widening access to enterprise data by freeing it from the application in which it is stored for some it organizations mashups provide a business ready proving ground for the investments they have made in an soa
5425649 the entry of such a big player into this market is a double edged sword for the boutique vendors
5425650 ibms entry will give this market some validity but now they have this really big player to compete with it starts the window closing so to speak its just a matter of time now before oracle gets its mashup act together and microsoft recognizes that the enterprise is a viable market
5425651 think about how quickly your business environment changes now think about how quickly your enterprise applications change theres a huge gap between constantly changing and glacially changing this is where mashups play they allow power users to build applications very quickly that may be totally disposable they enable what i call the long tail of applications
5425652 now instead of building large applications for roles that apply to many users you can build apps quickly for low cost that address individuals in the long tail
5425653 instead of building the finished application which can take forever and is ultimately used by a relatively small number of people they can build a repository of mashable components that end users can in a variety of ways and that way gain leverage into that long tail
5425654 you can make the argument that the upfront work could save developers time down the road its true that they have to invest time to enable the framework for composition enable the data services and handle security and governance issues thats why i am currently seeing that people prefer to deploy mashups within a portal infrastructure to take advantage of existing infrastructure but in the long run if you truly can enable more self service in your user community you can reduce pent up demand for applications as people will be able to build some of these applications on their own

5425670 when it comes to war we should fight dirty when the enemy knows that you will stop at nothing to win as fast as possible they are quick to back down operation desert storm in the long run that s how lives are saved when they know that you must fight by some set of rules and they are not required to comply they will use that to their advantage as the terrorists have i don t care if every one of bin laden s warriors rots in gitmo until they die

5425673 sometimes we must take the fight directly to our enemies there are people in this world who need killing and there is no one better at meeting their needs than the us army
5425674 today afghanistan is the war in which so much of our national security is at stake yet it is the forgotten step child of the war on terror
5425675 the united states has the necessary instruments to defeat al qaida it just needs to shift its strategy and keep in mind that terrorist groups are not eradicated overnight
5425676 the pursuit of freedom as defined in an age of consumerism has induced a condition of dependence on imported goods on imported oil and on credit the chief desire of the american people is that nothing should disrupt their access to these goods that oil and that credit the chief aim of the u s government is to satisfy that desire which it does in part of through the distribution of largesse here at home and in part through the pursuit of imperial ambitions abroad

5425694 i know i know me too what was wrong with us
5425695 well youre always visiting sick people youre in the hospital and theyre sick or they manage to find you if you dont find them it has to be a lesson for me is all this sort of thing just makes me feel like garbage had the chance let it pass itll never be there again gone
5425696 how could that happen wait a minute you dont mean this she was so young she couldnt be much older than you right
5425697 she told me that i had to fight her parking ticket for her because i didnt move the car in that storm so of course i did i fought it and won and its a good thing i did
5425698 and now i know why you have the family resemblance
5425699 well ill tell you the truth i just i just wasnt getting enough attention on thursday the day of the funeral so i tripped and made them take me to the hospital i think it was brilliant

5425701 that youre stuck with a lot of pain for who knows how long

5425711 during my tenure in congress i have consistently opposed granting the food and drug administration the authority to regulate tobacco i do so based upon my philosophical beliefs and the ramifications this legislation would have upon my congressional district and state
5425712 as i have stated on many occasions i believe allowing fda to regulate tobacco in any capacity would inevitably lead to fda regulating the family farm
5425713 permitting fda on the farm creates uncertainty and adds another burden to the already overwhelmed fda
5425714 i also have concerns with the impact this legislation would have upon tobacco manufacturers and their employees these companies employ many hard working north carolinians and i believe fda regulation of tobacco could negatively affect these manufacturing jobs
5425715 finally taxing tobacco companies to fund additional regulation and avoid pay go problems is ill conceived and will create an incentive for black market activity such as counterfeiting and smuggling
5425716 madam speaker this legislation is misguided and in my opinion will not achieve the goals identified by proponents

5425751 since we won our first election by 2 500 votes
5425752 and then our first reelection was secured by a miniscule 79 vote margin some questioned how long we would be around my goals for this office have never changed however and that is to vote the way i think the majority of the citizens of the 6th district wish me to vote and to provide outstanding constituent services i guess that we have been successful enough in meeting those goals that i will have the honor of setting this record next week
5425753 congressman coble has been a role model for our students through his long service to the region and the citizens of north carolina
5425754 he has demonstrated the tremendous impact an individual can make through a career in government by securing federal funding for university projects and by assisting individual students faculty and staff in their dealings with the federal government congressman coble has stood as a strong advocate for higher education we congratulate him on reaching this milestone of civic involvement
5425755 i am proud that we were able to obtain the federal funding that guaranteed the completion of the doug galyon transportation depot in downtown greensboro
5425756 along with obtaining millions for the construction of the judy mendenhall terminal that serves the high point furniture market and much of the funding for the construction of the painter boulevard highway loop around greensboro i am proud of the work we have done to assist the traditional economic engines of the 6th district namely the furniture textile and tobacco industries while also working with others to expand and enhance new job opportunities for our constituents it has been my honor to serve the people of alamance chatham davidson davie guilford moore randolph and rowan counties who have lived in the various configurations of the 6th district of north carolina during my time in office

5425763 i am very pleased that this supplemental appropriations bills includes 400 million in additional fy08 funding for science programs including 125 million to boost funding for critical programs at the national science foundation and department of energy office of science that were authorized in the america competes act this funding will help avert layoffs and job losses at our national labs and boost research and teacher training programs that are critical to our nations competitiveness
5425764 our country cannot and should not compete with the rest of the world on wages when half of the worlds workers earn less than 2 a day rather we need to compete at a higher level with better skills and higher productivity that means we need to produce not only the worlds leading scientists and engineers but also ensure that all students will have a strong grounding in math and science and are prepared for technical jobs in every sector of the economy
5425765 the number one recommendation of the national academies rising above the gathering storm report was to ensure k 12 stem teachers across the country have strong content knowledge and effective teaching skills in competes we took this recommendation and revamped nsfs robert noyce teacher scholarship program by providing an additional 20 million for the noyce program this supplemental funding bill will ensure that this program can begin to be scaled out at colleges and universities around the country
5425766 the inclusion of competitiveness funding in this supplemental bill and the strong funding levels expected to be included in the fy09 house appropriations bills should leave no doubt about this congress commitment to federal funded basic research and math and science education

5425772 it is important for the united states federal government to support international science and technology cooperation but ngos and universities also serve a unique and valuable role in promoting science diplomacy

5425774 while i often emphasize the diplomatic benefits of international s amp t cooperation there are many compelling reasons for the u s public and private sectors alike to make s amp t cooperation a national priority

5425860 the false selling of the iraq war we were railroaded into an unnecessary war
5425861 no president of the united states should employ distortion of truth to take the nation to war
5425862 the bush administration convinced a substantial majority of americans before the war that saddam hussein was somehow linked to 9 11 inexcusably selling the false iraq al qaeda claim to americans
5425863 the president and his top advisers did not allow the american people or even congress to have the information necessary to make reasoned judgments of their own its obvious that the bush administration misled americans about mr husseins weapons and his terrorist connections

5425876 ive been working my entire adult life to help build an america where economic justice is being served
5425877 to fight them there so we dont have to fight them here
5425878 the attitude of the american public toward the external projection of american power has been much more ambivalent the public supported americas engagement in world war ii largely because of the shock effect of the japanese attack on pearl harbor
5425879 in that context how america manages eurasia is critical a power that dominates eurasia would control two of the worlds three most advanced and economically productive regions a mere glance at the map also suggests that control over eurasia would almost automatically entail africas subordination rendering the western hemisphere and oceania geopolitically peripheral to the worlds central continent about 75 per cent of the worlds people live in eurasia and most of the worlds physical wealth is there as well both in its enterprises and underneath its soil eurasia accounts for about three fourths of the worlds known energy resources
5425880 two basic steps are thus required first to identify the geostrategically dynamic eurasian states that have the power to cause a potentially important shift in the international distribution of power and to decipher the central external goals of their respective political elites and the likely consequences of their seeking to attain them second to formulate specific u s policies to offset co opt and or control the above
5425881 to put it in a terminology that harkens back to the more brutal age of ancient empires the three grand imperatives of imperial geostrategy are to prevent collusion and maintain security dependence among the vassals to keep tributaries pliant and protected and to keep the barbarians from coming together
5425882 turkmenistan has been actively exploring the construction of a new pipeline through afghanistan and pakistan to the arabian sea
5425883 it follows that americas primary interest is to help ensure that no single power comes to control this geopolitical space and that the global community has unhindered financial and economic access to it
5425884 chinas growing economic presence in the region and its political stake in the areas independence are also congruent with americas interests
5425885 in the long run global politics are bound to become increasingly uncongenial to the concentration of hegemonic power in the hands of a single state hence america is not only the first as well as the only truly global superpower but it is also likely to be the very last

5425890 every year severe winds from hurricanes tornadoes and thunderstorms damage or destroy thousands of homes and businesses harm vital infrastructure and most importantly threaten human life this year is already proving to be one of the deadliest years on record for wind related fatalities with over 100 americans killed in tornadoes this spring alone
5425891 dollar amounts vary widely on the extent of property damage and economic losses from windstorms but since 2004 windstorms have cost the country well over 160 billion from the more than a thousand people who lost their lives in hurricane katrina to the thousands left with damaged homes in my district last december windstorms have harmed every part of our country
5425892 since passage of the enacting legislation the program has done little to address this very sizable problem
5425893 unfortunately nwirp has received little attention by the administration in terms of both funding and coordination nwirp expires this fiscal year and if we are to reauthorize it we will need to discuss how it can be changed to ensure it meets its goals of improving the safety of americans by increasing protection from wind hazards
5425894 damage from storms is projected to increase as a greater number of americans move to coastal areas
5425895 however we are not completely powerless to reduce the losses from windstorms known mitigation techniques can greatly decrease the amount of wind damage in some cases by as much as 50 to 60 percent

5425930 americas energy solution will be achieved by expanding renewable fuel production and alternative energy through investment in scientific research

5425933 working closely with the community we are delivering groundbreaking creative features that will be transformative for interactive designers and developers and revolutionary for end users
5425934 one of the best things about the creative features now available in adobe flash player 10 beta is that they wont slow down performance
5425935 with flash player 10 beta developers can enable swf content to render through the memory bandwidth and computational horsepower of the gpu hardware processor freeing up the cpu to do more such as render 3d content and intricate effects and process complex business logic no other browser runtime has these capabilities
5425936 the 3d effects and transformations now available in adobe flash player 10 beta enable developers to get started quickly with 3d
5425937 for interactive designers and developers well versed in creating 3d experiences the revamped drawing api and pixel bender language will enable an entirely new depth of graphics unseen on the web today interactive designers and developers will be able to create movie like experiences with special effects that before werent possible on the web
5425938 recent droughts experienced in the west and the southeast and increased competition for water supplies suggest that we must take a closer look at how we are managing our water resources
5425939 drought population growth and climate change continue to put stress on the nations existing water supplies lending urgency to a national goal of water conservation my legislation hr 3957 to establish a research development and demonstration program within the epas office of research and development ord will help us to move new water conserving technologies forward and promote greater awareness of the need to conserve this vital resource
5425940 nationally 36 states are anticipating local regional or statewide water shortages by 2013 americans now use an average of 100 gallons of water per person every day if we dont soon come up with innovative technology to use water more efficiently the well so to speak is going to run dry
5425941 i believe with investment in research and development public education and better information on the status of our water supplies we can avoid the high costs social disruption and environmental damage associated with water shortages
5425942 your work is to discover your work and then with all your heart to give yourself to it
5425943 i turned to my dad and said dad we got the same score he looked up and said oh yeah we started getting a little confused
5425944 its not correct i believe its correct to have two gold medals
5425945 but this is my modest opinion the ioc is different
5425946 im not sure if anybody understands what the hell is going on
5425947 it wasnt like i got second by three tenths or five tenths i had the same score thats what makes it a little harder to take
5425948 in other sports like track and field its all timed and it doesnt have anything to do with judging you do your routine and you turn it over to the judges thats what weve been going through our entire lives and weve come to accept it
5425949 i play by the rules so in my opinion i have to say yes
5425950 judges have their own opinion and once you land your dismount theres nothing else you can do
5425951 i have the most important medal and its the all around gold
5425952 i have four medals now and im tied with my dad one gold two silvers and a bronze and i have one more chance to get one gold that i feel like i missed out on today
5425953 iraq is a very wealthy country enormous oil reserves they can finance largely finance the reconstruction of their own country and i have no doubt that they will
5425954 the likely economic effects of the war in iraq would be relatively small under every plausible scenario the negative effect will be quite small relative to the economic benefits
5425955 it is unimaginable that the united states would have to contribute hundreds of billions of dollars and highly unlikely that we would have to contribute even tens of billions of dollars
5425956 when it comes to reconstruction before we turn to the american taxpayer we will turn first to the resources of the iraqi government and the international community
5425957 there is a lot of money to pay for this that doesnt have to be u s taxpayer money and it starts with the assets of the iraqi people we are talking about a country that can really finance its own reconstruction and relatively soon
5425958 the united states is committed to helping iraq recover from the conflict but iraq will not require sustained aid
5425959 iraq has tremendous resources that belong to the iraqi people and so there are a variety of means that iraq has to be able to shoulder much of the burden for ther own reconstruction
5425960 you took me to another realm where its only you and me the closer i come to your smile the more i feel so free spin spin spin spinning around then our feet will touch the ground

5425983 both the press and the electronic media should exercise caution in publishing any news regarding the case in question which may have the effect of prejudicing defence of the accused or damaging the reputation of any person connected with the case
5425984 nobody is trying to gag the media they must play a responsible role by investigation the media must not do anything which will prejudice either the prosecution or the accused sometimes the entire focus is lost a person is found guilty even before the trial takes place see what happened in this aarushi case till today what is the evidence against anyone
5425985 we will lay down guidelines on media coverage we are not concerned about media criticising us let media say anything about us we are not perturbed our shoulders are broad enough and we will ignore it the criticism we are for media freedom what we are saying is there is no absolute freedom see what happened to dr talwar aarushis father his reputation is tarnished
5425986 what we have heard today is that the health of our oceans is at risk we must move quickly to better understand ocean acidification and its impacts the health of our oceans is linked to human health in many ways and the economic well being of coastal communities is dependent upon the health and productivity of our oceans
5425987 ocean acidification poses a threat to many marine organisms and ocean ecosystems it reduces the ability of shellfish and corals to form their shells and skeletons it impacts the health and survival of other organisms that are part of the food chain supporting fish and marine mammals coral reefs and many of our fisheries are already compromised by overfishing disease pollution and rising water temperatures ocean acidification is yet another stress that could dramatically and permanently alter our ocean environments

5426028 washington has been forced to gull its citizens and creditors by debasing official statistics the vital instruments with which the vigor and muscle of the american economy are measured

5426047 i guess the most important personal application of these child like ruminations is that i am at peace with my immaturity im not trying to be a different person but i am trying to feed my head to learn something new i read books attend interesting conferences and brainstorm with polymaths and diverse domain experts
5426048 in their introspections one finds an emphasis upon the production of a free flow of ideas the bubbling forth of varieties of associations concerning the matter at hand einstein for example refers to the need for combinatory play and associative play in putting ideas together dryden describes the process of writing as involving a confusd mass of thoughts tumbling over one another in the dark

5426052 the bipartisan consensus we have reached on h r 6063 signals that congress believes a balanced nasa program of science aeronautics and human spaceflight and exploration is important and worthy of the nations support
5426053 yet i want to emphasize that h r 6063 takes a fiscally responsible approach to providing that support
5426054 by increasing our investment in nasa we are putting the united states on a course to remain a world leader in innovation and economic competitiveness
5426055 the discoveries and advancements made by nasa research ripple through many sectors of our economy moving our nation forward and benefiting all americans
5426056 nasa has accomplished a great deal in both space and aeronautical r amp d over the past five decades and we can all take pride in what has been accomplished however we cannot become complacent
5426057 the testimony and constructive input of countless hearing witnesses outside experts and organizations that led to h r 6063 conveyed a consistent message that nasa has not been given the funding it needs to successfully carry out all of the important tasks that the nation has asked of it if we fail to invest adequately in nasa now it is unlikely that we will see a comparable record of accomplishment over the next five decades at a great opportunity cost to the nation

5426100 we are troubled that the scope of the incident has changed since the committee was first briefed
5426101 a week after being told the contamination was contained and proper procedures were followed radioactive contamination was discovered in the lab sink indicating that a quantity of the plutonium had been washed down the drain were investigating the status of nists safety procedures
5426102 though i have received assurances from nist and local officials that the publics safety has not been compromised as a result of this incident i remain troubled by the prospect that this contamination could have ended up in the local sewer system
5426103 my office has been in close contact with the city of boulder and will continue to work with local and state authorities to ensure the safety of area residents in the meantime i am seeking answers from nist as to how this situation could have been allowed to occur in the first place
5426104 i respect the commendable work done by many dedicated researchers at nist but am very concerned about this incident
5426105 i hope that as the committee learns more we find that it is an isolated occurrence and is not indicative of a larger problem i urge nist to comply with the committees request for additional documentation as quickly as possible so that we can get to the bottom of what happened

5426116 this election will not restore the democrats to power here but it will provide a yardstick for how much ground the party has recovered since the rs won the last remaining prize that had eluded their grasp a majority in the state house of representatives in 2002 and with it the speakership now just six years later the ds have a chance to retake a slender majority in the house and to pick up seats in the state senate
5426117 if the ds stumble on election day all the momentum achieved over the past two years could be lost a bad performance would probably carry over to 2010 when the major state offices are up for grabs a resurgence by the rs would give them control of redistricting in 2011 and we know what they can do with that

5426137 nasa has a key role to play in the nations innovation agenda ensuring the future health of our nations aviation system and advancing our efforts to better understand our climate and the changes facing the earth system
5426138 in addition a properly structured human space flight and exploration program can provide dividends technologically scientifically and geopolitically and is worthy of the nations investment in it
5426139 h r 6063 will help point nasa towards a more productive and sustainable future
5426140 nasa should be and i believe is an agency that can be a strong catalyst for dealing with important national concerns and this bill helps emphasize that moreover this legislation includes substantive measures to help realize the synergies achievable between government and the private sector

5426207 no longer can we in good conscience escape the question what do we do about the offshoring of american jobs if we are to find effective answers we must be open to hearing new ideas we must be prepared to discover that we know less than we thought about the consequences of globalization or even that some of our basic views on the subject may rest on mistaken assumptions

5426216 few elections are ever about what opinion the majority of eligible voters hold they are all about the majority of those who actually cast a ballot
5426217 i dont understand the statement sometimes made that rodgers was great but the other petition trustees are a decline in quality
5426218 the association conducts the elections for alumni trustee nominees not for trustee positions
5426219 why dont the trustees just reject the alumnis choice if the winner is a petition candidate
5426220 because they dont have to in order to retain their rights
5426221 the lawsuit is not about petition trustees anyway it is about alumni trustees
5426222 what good is retaining their rights if they are not getting what they want
5426223 if the board does not like a nominee elected by alumni why do they simply not vote to seat the person
5426224 the sham of telling alumni to pick any color as long as its black wouldnt create enough alumni loyalty or donations to outweigh the costs of this system
5426225 the elections were just as much ceremonial shams meaning the board didnt reject people enough to make it a real selection process which is what it now says it wants
5426226 the board lacks the authority to order the aa around

5426230 vi kan se at st vlaget ndrer sig f rst og at luften begynder at komme fra troperne der sker alts et skift hvor monsunb ltet rykker sig nordp og luftcirkulationen skifter fra det ene r til det andet og derefter begynder at p virke klimaet i nordatlanten fort ller dorthe dahl jensen
5426231 selv om klimaforandringerne har v ret voldsomst i nordatlanten s tyder vores m linger p at de skyldes vejrforandringer i troperne der er en sammenh ng med nogle fundamentale skift i de atmosf riske str mninger siger dorthe dahl jensen de udborede islag viser at der er en sammenh ng mellem koldt klima og st v i atmosf ren da st vet i isen mest kommer fra asien konkluderer forskerne at de udl sende faktorer er nogle fjerne vejrforhold
5426232 skiftene i klimaet sker nemlig meget meget hurtigere end hidtil antaget
5426233 forskerne arbejder meget lidt meget meget lidt med jordens biologiske processer
5426234 det er ikke ved polerne man skal finde et svar p ndringer det er der hvor problemerne kommer fra kvator hvorfor tror i at vejret ndrer sig i troperne dengang som nu co2 eller ikke co2

5426241 tinyco2 13 29 22 i think this climate cop thing is a good idea parents who are caught out should be suitable chastened and help put things right they should carry out the following co2 reducing activities 1 remove the fuses from most of your childs toys tv phone charger etc 2 turn off the heating air con to your childs bedroom ambient should do 3 refuse to drive your child to anything fun 4 serve cold locally sourced food lots of broccoli 5 buy new clothes for them from a second hand source 6 halve their allowance and place it in an eco fund 7 make them plant trees on the weekend 8 send them to a local camp while the rest of the family fly away on a holiday 9 make them wash the dishes and their clothes by hand im sure we can think of some more helpful carbon cutting hints

5426244 as important as creativity is in all aspects of life i simply do not see why it should be used as an excuse to sacrifice literally thousands of years of continuity with tradition in the process in this regard the desperate obsession with being modern seems rather old fashioned after all modernism is only a style but why can t we be obsessed with being above all human that way i believe lies true modernity since the process of life itself involves a subtle balance between the past and the future most of us need roots and a sense of belonging in order to feel some degree of security and meaning our built environment best enshrines that psychological need in a physical form and in a world dependent on technology surely we need a contrast in our surroundings that reflects our innate humanity and not just a continuity of the dvd player or the lap top computer

5426351 i remain unconvinced that the department of energys decision to terminate support for the futuregen project is the right thing to do the committee has been trying to get answers about the departments actions but those answers have been vague and unpersuasive in fact following a hearing the committee held on this matter the department has refused for over two months to provide the committee with documentation that would allow congress to evaluate how this project was managed by the department moreover the department is now charging forward with their new program before the congress has been provided with the details of their plan and its costs
5426352 though i am aware that the department has taken the futuregen program in a dramatically different direction it is unclear that it is the best approach to ensure that we will accelerate the development of carbon capture and sequestration technologies as quickly and cheaply as possible surely the committee deserves to review the documents we asked for two months ago before we can begin to evaluate the departments suggested path forward

5426365 we want to teach young people in the community and hopefully touch them in a way that they will choose the positive over the negative
5426366 i want to put a barrier between our young people and the streets
5426367 i strongly believe that the hooters concept is something that israelis are looking for

5426369 the system will allow much faster analysis of complex problems like understanding and predicting how the power grid behaves one of the most complex engineering systems ever built

5426382 these people with the fires and the floods and everything they overbuild and they put nature to the test and they get whats coming to them thats what i say
5426383 people think nature is outside of them they dont take into themselves the idea that nature is a part of them
5426384 nature is in here and if youre in tune with it like the indians the balance of life the harmony of nature if you understand that you dont overbuild you dont do all this moron stuff

5426387 its nothing i can control and honestly i can say it has been very fair to me and i got the biggest gold medal of them all
5426388 im a little sad but at the same time its great to have four olympic medals
5426389 i turned to my dad and said dad we got the same score he looked up and said oh yeah we started getting a little confused
5426390 its not correct i believe its correct to have two gold medals
5426391 but this is my modest opinion the ioc is different
5426392 im not sure if anybody understands what the hell is going on
5426393 it wasnt like i got second by three tenths or five tenths i had the same score thats what makes it a little harder to take
5426394 in other sports like track and field its all timed and it doesnt have anything to do with judging you do your routine and you turn it over to the judges thats what weve been going through our entire lives and weve come to accept it
5426395 shes an excellent athlete no matter how old she is
5426396 shes done her hard work and her preparation she definitely deserved her gold medal
5426397 i play by the rules so in my opinion i have to say yes
5426398 judges have their own opinion and once you land your dismount theres nothing else you can do
5426399 i have the most important medal and its the all around gold
5426400 i have four medals now and im tied with my dad one gold two silvers and a bronze and i have one more chance to get one gold that i feel like i missed out on today
5426401 nasas aeronautics program is one of the things that make nasa relevant to the nations needs yet it has become clear that nasas aeronautics program has been significantly shortchanged in recent years when it comes to getting the resources required to address our nations needs
5426402 ensuring that americas aviation system maintains a safety record second to none is my highest priority in doing that we must focus on research that will ensure that the nations air traffic management system will be able to meet anticipated demand while preserving safety and improving passengers air travel experience
5426403 the decline in nasas aeronautics funding is making it increasingly difficult to maintain an aeronautics research program that will be capable of stepping up to the challenges the nations aviation sector will be facing in the coming decades in short the future relevance of nasas aeronautics program is at risk just when the need for nasas research contributions is greatest
5426404 aeronautics needs to be a priority at nasa it is as simple as that i think the nasa authorization act of 2005 got it right when it reaffirmed that aeronautics research remains a core mission of nasa

5426429 if you dont do as we ask we will openly condemn you for not acting like a responsible citizen

5426432 unfortunately the resources that the people working on behalf of sustainability save are not preserved for the use of future generations but rather are used to support the continued growth of the population thus the net result of many of the actions of the sustainers is to accommodate and hence to encourage continued population growth
5426433 faced with the inevitability of resource limits the best scenario is to hit these limits with as small a human population as possible our waste and inefficiency then becomes a buffer of unused capacity as resources decline we can reduce our consumption but still have enough to support life maybe if our supporting ecosystems have not collapsed completely in contrast if we hit our resource limits with maximal numbers of humans each living very frugally then we have no spare capacity to fall back on and we will all perish

5426442 first time in the political history of pakistan that the people have won over the establishment
5426443 i leave my fate in the hands of the people of pakistan i am human so i may have made mistakes but my intentions were always honest and im sure the people will excuse me
5426444 he should answer in a court of law for the crimes he has committed against the people of pakistan we feel that all that should be brought out in an open public trial
5426445 we have no comments to make on the resignation of president musharraf of pakistan this is an internal matter of pakistan
5426446 we have been critical of pakistans interference in our internal matters in the context of the recent developments in jammu amp kashmir
5426447 to go through what i went through and be back on top again im just so blessed right now
5426448 any mistakes i made i put the blame on me

5426463 because livecycle es integrates with existing systems and simplifies deploying applications for data capture and processing as well as offers enhanced content management capabilities we can do more with limited it resources were constantly balancing what we want to do with what we can do livecycle es helps to close that gap
5426464 so we are committed to bringing the flash experience to the iphone and we will work with apple
5426465 we can now start to develop the flash player ourselves and we think it benefits our joint customers so we want to work with apple to bring that capability to the device
5426466 to bring the full capabilities of flash to the iphone web browsing experience we do need to work with apple beyond and above what is available through the sdk and the current license around it
5426467 their collaborative environment and progressive production company model presented us with an opportunity we just couldnt pass up they really give us the freedom to come up with ideas and see them through to the end the entire team contributes to every project and it creates an inspired supportive atmosphere for us to explore boundaries and deliver really fresh compelling work
5426468 dave and rory have that easy genius at concepting big comedic integrated ideas and flawlessly executing those ideas across any platform they are the model of the next generation director that mekanism offers to agencies
5426469 when state and local authorities get poor information or no information from iris regarding the health hazards of a particular pollutant their response to pollution in a community is likely to be confused and confusing
5426470 the white house has effectively blocked the epa from posting new health assessments of hazardous chemicals by prolonging the assessments because of inevitable uncertainties about the interaction of chemicals and human health
5426471 completion of an iris assessment is just the first step in the process protecting people from dangerous exposures to toxic chemicals
5426472 people will have been exposed to a known toxic substance for decades for a generation while the government engages in study after study have we become so obsessed with getting the science right that we have lost sight of our real goal protecting public health or is getting the science right a pretext for obstruction
5426473 de blob was the eye opener for us that we can make cool games and function as a good team the game definitely gave us the opportunity to start our own company

5426496 there will be many applications on qq sns in the future not all apps need to be developed by tencent we can open api to allow third party apps users can get these apps on im or on blogs but it should not be too open to avoid advertising behaviors and cheating we will control it by some means
5426497 open platform will be easily outdated and touch the ceiling soon just as what happened to online chat room
5426498 in fact if they are good apps it is inevitable that platform provider will develop it by itself the third party apps will be replaced sooner or later for those apps which platform provider does not develop they are definitely not good

5426500 on june 5th we heard from a panel of experts on ocean and atmospheric sciences testify in strong support of this legislation
5426501 ocean acidification is not often talked about but may very well be one of the greatest threats facing our oceans and marine life promoting further understanding of ocean acidification and preventing it from worsening is absolutely essential
5426502 the national sea grant college program was last reauthorized in 2002 sea grant research education and extension programs have been very effective in training future scientists and resource managers generating information to support sound resource management and delivering applied research results to the people who rely on our coastal areas and great lakes for their livelihoods
5426503 this bill addresses a narrow segment of the automobile market with a tremendous potential impact we heard in a subcommittee hearing last week from witnesses who described the substantial oil savings and emissions reductions to be had in medium to heavy hybrid trucks as well as the benefit to the whole domestic automotive sector from the invaluable lessons learned in designing and manufacturing these systems
5426504 i believe this is a very important piece of legislation in the large and complex puzzle that is our transportation sector
5426505 you got to be a white boy cause a nigger with a baseball uniform on wouldnt be readin no paper couldnt read at all

5426517 yup perdita is right its quite common for another progamer to give free wins to another if they are friends especially when one progamer needs the win for the goal of top 6 while a win loss does not matter as much to the other
5426518 its quite common for another progamer to give free wins to another if they are friends etc

5426521 the power to plunge into a research university which he said would hurt undergraduate education
5426522 gado predicted that adjunct professors would teach more classes and too much attention would be focused on faculty members individual research rather than providing sufficient general courses for students
5426523 tas provide students the opportunity for focused individualized writing instruction the teaching assistants meeting with each student for one hour each week diagnose individual writing weaknesses and prescribe strategies compatible with each students learning style
5426524 tas are engaged in important teaching partnerships with the 2 3 faculty though the writing 2 3 instructors are exceptionally committed to their students they nonetheless rely on the tas to keep them abreast of their students progress tas regularly alert instructors not only to problems with individual students but to shared confusion anxiety and concerns
5426525 though the writing 2 3 instructors are exceptionally committed to their students
5426526 they nonetheless rely on the tas to keep them abreast of their students progress
5426527 retain discretion and control over the use of the funds and maintain records establishing that the funds are used for charitable purposes
5426528 former association president bill hutchinson 76 who voted against the suit said in an interview he had previously asked to see a copy of the engagement letter but both williams and connolly and gado declined his request
5426529 i will never finish calling frank gado names hes a jerk
5426530 the donations from the hanover institute went to a designated use that both the donor and the acceptee wanted
5426531 i still think we have a good case but it s very hard in this state of new hampshire to go against dartmouth said gado a board member of macgovern s hanover institute
5426532 frank noted that he does not know who is paying the legal fees he never wanted to be brought into that discussion
5426533 frank noted that he does not know who is paying the legal fees
5426534 how do you know that gado had not fully informed the committee majority
5426535 the expansion of zends board of directors ensures the company will fully leverage the financial opportunities being created by our multi year track record of growth we conducted an extensive search and steve stood out as an exceptional candidate given his strong operational and financial experience
5426536 zend is quickly reaching a critical stage as open source goes mainstream inside the enterprise
5426537 all indications are that they will continue on their current growth trajectory and i look forward to bringing an operational and fiscal perspective at the board level to help manage and leverage those opportunities
5426538 this blog doesnt seem to generate as much traffic as i remembered when i first set it up this year where did everybody go
5426539 we hope to have a model in place this season our opening up of the rights will certainly be done the nba is negotiating on behalf of its 30 teams
5426540 they also are uncertain whether the games will be hosted on the local team site the rsn site or both details of advertising within the feeds and who sells that are also still to be worked out adding to the uncertainty is the fact that some teams do not even hold the necessary streaming rights since some have sold them to regional sports networks along with their tv rights
5426541 perhaps by finding ways for the m l b to work more closely with the broadcasters and their advertisers
5426542 if you have under 100 000 even the token ira fees and commissions of 15 30 or 50 add up
5426543 the pro for rolling it over into an ira is diversification
5426544 in an ira you can invest in individual stocks bonds and any mutual fund you want to
5426545 someone has limited the choices to a reasonable number and done a screen for you
5426546 if you are satisfied with the investments that you have then you might want to leave your money there
5426547 you can do unlimited direct rollovers on an annual basis
5426548 if theres employer stock inside the 401 k you may want to not roll that portion into an ira
5426549 i welcome the department of energys announcement today regarding its submittal of a license application to the nuclear regulatory commission to construct a deep geologic repository for spent nuclear fuel and high level radioactive waste at yucca mountain this application is long overdue
5426550 as congress begins to consider climate change legislation there is wide recognition that nuclear power will continue to supply a significant part of our electricity needs even if our country advances new nuclear technologies such as spent fuel reprocessing establishing and building a permanent high level waste storage facility at yucca mountain is critical to dealing with existing spent fuel and to the future of nuclear energy in our country

5426552 those smelly old dogs are giving me a head ache

5426554 i used comic life on my mac exclusively to lay out the storyboards then later when i created and colored all 24 pages of the issue
5426555 being an illustrator it saved me quite a bit of time from having to lay all the text bubbles out manually it made the process of actually creating the comic that much more enjoyable
5426556 the idea of this program always seemed silly to us because we have hundreds of volunteers each month

5426560 rising costs of energy are hurting consumers at the pump families at the supermarket and threatening job security because high prices are weakening the competitiveness of our domestic industries
5426561 the fact of the matter is the status quo in energy is simply unsustainable there continues to be a need for ground breaking science based energy solutions that can be deployed in the marketplace
5426562 introducing a small agile darpa like organization could improve the department of energys pursuit of r amp d much as darpa did for the department of defense
5426563 arpa e represents a bold step but thats what is needed to surmount our greatest energy challenges and ensure the united states will be able to maintain its position as a global leader in innovation
5426564 four times in this congress the house has voted to repeal between 13 billion and 18 billion in tax and other incentives for the oil industry
5426565 i dont disagree that we need incentives to move toward energy independence but i dont believe the federal government should be subsidizing an industry that is already seeing the highest profits on record with oil at 125 a barrel and oil company profits at 123 billion last year alone i think this 18 billion would be much better used to invest in the very goals and technologies that we are talking about today arpa e renewable energy energy efficiency and clean coal
5426566 the united states cannot afford to continue losing our best and brightest women from academic science and engineering careers
5426567 the programs in this bill are just a small part of what is needed to tackle the barriers to women in science and engineering in fact there is only so much congress can do to compel what is ultimately a change to an academic culture with a long and proud history i want to thank congresswoman johnson for bringing this important legislative proposal before the subcommittee
5426568 while i do not intend to be heavy handed toward our universities i do feel that not nearly enough is being done to educate persons of influence on the subtle gender bias that exists and is holding women back from achieving at the same level as men
5426569 our real time traffic service has seen an explosion in momentum this year with paid subscribers to the service reaching a milestone of 500 000
5426570 its rewarding to know that people living in or driving through these newly added markets will be able to experience our service and enjoy a more predictable ride

5426584 irrigating with wastewater isnt a rare practice limited to a few of the poorest countries
5426585 its a widespread phenomenon occurring on 20 million hectares across the developing world especially in asian countries like china india and vietnam but also around nearly every city of sub saharan africa and in many latin american cities as well
5426586 in the face of water scarcity generally and a lack of access to clean water urban farmers will have no alternative except to use diluted or untreated wastewater or polluted river water
5426587 of costs for providing clean water around the world go toward corruption
5426588 this has resulted in significant increase in pressure on natural resources and infrastructure and also several inadequacies
5426589 one such inadequacy is water resources and the problem is compounded due to its location in the water deficit zone in fact inefficient urban and environmental planning have sealed off additional water potentials which would have other wise solved the city water problems in a much easier way the use of untreated waste water in agriculture has been posing health problems to the farmers in the city region

5426593 by leveraging a vestigial legal right to some portion of the windows api in this case literally the windows xp api
5426594 this bold strategy is based on the high probability that if something called windows vista ships at all next january it will really be windows xp sp4 with a new name microsoft is so bloated and paralyzed that this could happen but whats missing is an apple application strategy to go with this operating system strategy because microsofts true power lies not in windows but in microsoft office fortunately for apple i believe there is an application plan in the works and i will describe it here
5426595 the bludgeon microsoft uses to keep other software vendors in line
5426596 without office microsoft is just a company with an archaic and insecure os if apple does go ahead to compete head to head with microsoft for microsofts own windows customers cupertino will have to be ready in case mac office is withdrawn and windows office mysteriously breaks on apple hardware there is a good likelihood this wont happen especially if microsoft can find a way to rev mac office for intelmacs sorta running windows a hybrid product that would look better than the windows version while retaining 100 percent compatibility and generating an enormous new revenue stream for redmond this is the carrot apple will use to keep microsoft from doing something truly destructive
5426597 apple is as dependent on adobe as it is microsoft for the general office market and now that adobe owns macromedia apple is even more vulnerable
5426598 adobe has already made one feint away from mac development that required personal pressure from steve jobs on john warnock to reverse if apple kinda sorta embraces windows enough for adobe to question whether continued development for the native os x platform is still warranted well then apple will just become another dell which isnt what steve jobs wants steve wants windows applications to run like crazy on his hybrid platform but to look like crap in his heart of hearts hed still like to beat microsoft on the merits not just by leveraging some clever loophole so he needs the top isvs who are currently writing for os x to continue writing for os x and that especially means adobe theres only one way to make that happen for sure and thats for apple to buy adobe
5426599 apple has the stock they have the cash such a purchase would effectively cost apple nothing the market would like it so well
5426600 we do not believe adobes business will suffer as a result of the entry of microsofts competing offerings
5426601 the promise of nanotechnology is enormous but potential downsides need to be addressed from the beginning in a thorough transparent process
5426602 the federal interagency nanotechnology research program has not yet put in place a well designed adequately funded and effectively executed research program focused on the environmental and safety aspects of nanotechnology h r 5940 addresses this deficiency by requiring that a research plan with detailed objectives and funding targets be developed and quickly implemented
5426603 we need to protect the public health and allay any safety concerns
5426604 i believe h r 5940 will help ensure the safety of new products for the benefit of both the business community and the public generally
5426605 the coast salish have extensive traditional ecological knowledge of their environment and patterns of change across the salish sea

5426675 better be careful eric we dont want an assident or something
5426676 dont comment much but do pop in every so often
5426677 is it true what us elaine sees in the photo was someone stepping over you
5426678 i was here fighting for custody i think a mothers greatest fear is somebody trying to take their children that is what i was up against i have won custody and decision making and thats all i ever wanted

5426682 i met an administrator from reed college on a rock climb in nevada this past spring break
5426683 thanks to the alumni vote what little there was has been further diminished in the eyes of the establishment
5426684 the alumni governance debate the trustee election discussions about a controlling bureacracy and the outdoor programs firing are related
5426685 the dean of the college doesnt care how many trustees there are or who nominates them
5426686 also helps manage daily operations of the collis information desk
5426687 serves as the link between the various financial needs of the organizations and the sometimes confusing college accounting system policies to make sure all the forms of financial paperwork go through the system smoothly
5426688 i think that andy likely resigned in the face of administrative opposition to his goals
5426689 in fact an inquiry to the alumni relations office will show there is a
5426690 andy likely resigned in the face of administrative opposition to his goals
5426691 i would insist that the man who spends four years in our north country and does not learn to hear the melody of rustling leaves or does not learn to love the wash of racing brooks over their rocky beds in the spring who has never experienced the repose to be found on lakes and rivers who has not stood enthralled on the top of moosilauke on a moonlit night or has not become a worshipper of color as he has seen the sunset from one of hanovers hills who has not thrilled at the whiteness of the snow clad countryside in winter or at the flaming forest colors of the fall n i would insist that this man has not reached out for some of the most worthwhile educational values accessible to him at dartmouth
5426692 coddled students in the process of breaking strings to parents
5426693 you the freedom to make mistakes and learn from them above all he was comfortable being in the position of power without being in a position of control simply put andy trusted students to handle themselves in a way that encouraged them to live up to that trust somehow he was able to allow nearly complete student autonomy without compromising the safety standard we subject ourselves to the hard work and play ethic or the coherence of our programs in doing this andy harvard enabled us to take responsibility for ourselves in a way that some call growing up and treated us as the emerging adults that all college students are for me this was the most important part of my college education
5426694 andy harvard was not liked by holly sateia long time dean of student life recently appointed vp for institutional diversity and equity
5426695 he was doing things that had never been done before
5426696 yet key policymakers ignored the signs in some cases even nudging the bubbles along by endorsing the practices that inflated them

5426700 oh and eric i was wondering whether you hold yourself to a standard of posting a photo taken the day you post it i hoped you didnt because that was so much to expect of yourself
5426701 reflects our human dignity its not that we think were equal to god but we recognize that we are made in the image and likeness of god
5426702 because the earliest christians viewed jesus as god and man they generally stood during worship services to show reverence and equality around the 7th century however catholic theologians put more emphasis on christs divinity and introduced kneeling as the only appropriate posture at points in the mass when god was believed to be present
5426703 a signal of the division in the church between two camps those who have caught the spirit of vatican ii and those who are a bit suspicious
5426704 get off their knees or quit st marys and the diocese of orange
5426705 7 things in random order that i think everyone who is looking to buy or sell in todays market needs to know
5426706 i am the resurrection and the live he who believes in my though he die yet shall he live and whoever lives and believes in me shall never die
5426707 let us also go that we may die with him
5426708 well do you think the organ is too loud when the stained glass is rattling in the windows
5426709 well what is it about the band that seems too loud is it the guitars
5426710 no i like the guitars my daughter plays the guitar have you heard her shes really good
5426711 yes i have heard her play and she is really good and i wish she would leave her church and join my church oh no i didnt say anything i was just clearing my throat is it the piano is the piano too loud
5426712 i dont care about any focus group research we are naming my bread company after me
5426713 if my dad says name the company after him then name it after him
5426714 if you know the enemy and know yourself you need not fear the result of a hundred battles
5426715 they were able to bring this to market very successfully because they have a huge backlog of 1 3 billion and the customer base in very strong
5426716 this is true of many companies in this space theres more orders than product around this company is in that same category
5426717 there is insufficient evidence available to allow independent observers to state reliably whether the results declared in the may 2008 elections for the mayor of london and the london assembly are an accurate representation of voters intentions
5426718 dartmouth alumni have expressed their support for ending the lawsuit against the college and pursuing a more collaborative and productive approach to governance
5426719 so where else do we in the minority go with our time and money
5426720 the vote as it was proves the trustees correct in their belief that alumni are not discerning enough to be given such powers
5426721 so where else do we in the minority go with our time and money
5426722 i pay my financial dues but expect others to do all the work so i can just play golf
5426723 should not the burden be on you to prove their dishonesty
5426724 not all of the alumni association officers elected last week agree with the boards plan ms bascomb said but they all feel that the lawsuit is inappropriate
5426725 these new people are entitled to their opinions but can they take any action
5426726 i know they are going to drop the lawsuit but after that isnt their role limited to running elections
5426727 so we the alumni vote for people who dont represent us while the alumni council appoints the people who do
5426728 the aa does represent you it just has a limited job which would be the case no matter which slate won and which you knew before you voted

5426732 americans need an efficient system to evaluate the risk to public health and the environment of chemicals on a regular basis and have ready access to that information
5426733 ombs mission does not include scientific analysis nor does omb appear be have the expertise to perform such work
5426734 as a result of ombs control of iris evaluation procedures four chemicals have been listed on iris in the last two fiscal years epa scientists produced 15 or so assessments in each of these years but the assessments disappeared into an abyss of elaborate endless reviews mostly behind closed doors the system is fundamentally broken and cries out for reform
5426735 with the new process announced april 10 we may view two new entries a year as the golden era of iris assessments
5426736 the solution offered by epa and omb is to take a broken system and to make it more convoluted secretive and suspect
5426737 americas space and aeronautics programs deliver significant benefits to the american people
5426738 its important that nasa has the resources it needs to be successful in addressing our countrys important national needs i will continue to work with nasa on these goals while ensuring that we are accountable and good stewards of the taxpayers dollars this bill not only ensures that we invest adequately in nasas programs but equally importantly directs those investments in ways that are effective efficient and fiscally responsible
5426739 this is a common sense fiscally responsible bill that will set nasa on a good course for the future
5426740 hr 6063 ensures that nasas centers are healthy and capable of supporting the agencys challenging missions
5426741 nextgen needs to succeed to ensure safer and more efficient air travel system for our economy and the flying public and this bill will help ensure that nasa plays a meaningful role in the nextgen initiative in addition it focuses attention and resources on research and development to make sure that the aircraft of the future leaves as small an impact on the environment as possible whether that impact is noise energy consumption or harmful emissions
5426742 nations around the world are getting interested in space exploration im not interested in rerunning a space race
5426743 instead i want to leverage the emerging global interest to promote a peaceful cooperative approach to space exploration under strong american leadership this bill helps point us in that direction

5426749 what happens when news becomes more like entertainment and less like information
5426750 well personally i work on all my paintings with hopes of creating a dialogue among my piers who are adults so no i dont think its censorship
5426751 but i also think half the problem with the way news is delivered is that people dont want it to offend children and thats just wrong so obviously every parent has their own right to judge what media is best for their children to view play listen to etc
5426752 the purity of elections in the uk causes for concern
5426753 there is no presumption that delay is occasioned deliberately or on account of culpable negligence or on account of mala fides when substantial justice and technical considerations are pitted against each other the cause of substantial justice deserves to be preferred
5426754 experience shows that on account of an impersonal machinery no one in charge of the matter is directly hit or hurt by the judgment sought to be subjected to appeal and the inherited bureaucratic methodology imbued with the note making file pushing and passing the buck ethos delay on its part is less difficult to understand though more difficult to approve
5426755 the state which represents collective cause of the community does not deserve a litigant non grata status the judiciary is respected not on account of its power to legalise injustice on technical grounds but because it is capable of removing injustice and is expected to do so
5426756 ok lord i will do this as an act of love

5426760 there is a cost real world both individually in the form of ones health and collectively to the state health care plan
5426761 perhaps something to consider would be a forfeiture of an ability to participate in the plan or something of that nature
5426762 the bottom line is this is a work in progress
5426763 i find that frustrating but i guess thats the way the wheels of government turn
5426764 tailor make incentives and penalties that begin to lead to more in the way of health and less in the way of cost

5426787 the overall responsiveness and reliability of php web applications is determined by a wide range of factors php developers and web administrators often struggle with a patchwork of technologies to identify and remove bottlenecks and causes of failure
5426788 zend platform 3 6 offers a comprehensive solution to this problem at every stage of the application lifecycle it helps developers and administrators understand and improve the quality performance and reliability of their php applications
5426789 our business is characterized by very strong peaks of activity so our web applications need to be able to perform well under very high transaction volumes
5426790 during our recent start of sales of tickets for a major event we processed more than 20 000 job processes in the first few hours of ticket sales we deployed an early version of zend platform 3 6 on load balanced web servers with a dedicated job queue server which enabled us to process these transactions while maintaining very good response times on our website
5426791 zend framework applications are generally built using a model view controller design pattern mvc that enables a separation of business logic and data from the visual user interface elements the new url based page caching of platform 3 6 will dramatically improve the performance of these mvc applications
5426792 with over 3 million downloads to date and many corporate deployments of zend framework we are excited to be able to offer our customers this important new functionality

5426806 documents found on the premises were thrown from the windows to supporters outside after our supporters were moved away by the police computers already damaged were hurled out our main target was the mainframe we knew that putting this out of action would disrupt raytheons ordering system and thus hamper production including production of missiles the mainframe was decommissioned with a fire extinguisher
5426807 the jury has accepted that we were reasonable in our belief that the israel defence forces were guilty of war crimes in lebanon in the summer of 2006 that the raytheon company including its facility in derry was aiding and abetting the commission of these crimes and that the action we took was intended to have and did have the effect of hampering or delaying the commission of war crimes
5426808 on the office of the attorney general and the crown prosecution service in light of this verdict to institute an investigation into the activities of raytheon at its various plants across the uk with a view to determining whether raytheon is as we say it is a criminal enterprise
5426809 suzanne breen formerly of village now writing for the sunday tribune has been referred to the attorney general for possible contempt in an article published on 18 november in the sunday tribune
5426810 also rte has ordered belfast independent production company below the radar to delete sections on raytheon from a film about ireland and the arms trade transmitted on 14 january the effect of the ban is that all discussion of raytheons presence in derry has been shut down
5426811 although crime in northumbria has fallen significantly in the past 10 years our research shows that the perception of crime has not
5426812 we have therefore invested a significant amount in services which aim to make sure people have a better understanding of crime in their region
5426813 its important to bear in mind that a computer is not a soda can and a tv is not newspaper these are products that contain complex parts and are made up of dozens of materials some of which like lead and mercury are toxic separating these materials takes time and energy potentially exposing the environment and workers to hazardous substances and in the case of something like leaded glass from a computer monitor or tv leaves us with material that there isnt much demand for
5426814 fortunately there is a growing awareness of e waste recycling
5426815 e waste is hardly trash while some materials in electronic waste are potentially hazardous others are quite valuable it doesnt make a whole lot of sense to put gold in a dump
5426816 in addition to increasing the amount of e waste that is recycled we should also look at designing products in smarter ways why not design a computer or a cell phone using all of the same screws and no mercury
5426817 focused r amp d initiatives will be essential to help manufacturers of emerging technologies produce more environmentally friendly products while still meeting consumers needs
5426818 these two bills mark the 19th and 20th science and technology committee bills that will be enacted into law during 110th congress
5426819 im proud that my colleagues have advanced these bipartisan consensus bills that put good ideas into practice for our constituents and our country
5426820 because the steel aluminum and copper industries are important for our economy and critical to national security i introduced h r 1126 which will increase the energy efficiency and enhance the competitiveness of these industries
5426821 i am pleased that this bill has now passed the house and senate and will soon be signed into law as part of the consolidated natural resources bill this is a major win for american workers american metal industries and the environment
5426822 i am pleased to have worked with rep biggert to make this technology transfer program at the department of energy even more effective
5426823 the purpose of this program is to encourage the real world use of energy efficiency technologies that have already been developed but have been sitting unused on the shelf encouraging the use of these technologies offers the promise of immediate help with our problems with our energy needs our energy costs and our dependence on foreign oil
5426824 since 2001 aviation security has vastly improved there are new policies in place to help protect passengers and aircraft and aviation security professionals are better trained to detect dangerous items of course technology plays a critical role significant advances in aviation security technologies have led to screening equipment that is faster and more reliable than the last generation allowing transportation security administration screeners to process passengers and baggage efficiently while still keeping prohibited items off planes
5426825 rigorous testing and evaluation are a crucial step toward ensuring that new technologies meet tsas technical needs currently tsa works closely with the laboratory to develop test protocols and define criteria for success but the security failures discovered by gao and others illustrate the need to constantly update tests to ensure that technologies can deal with emerging threats technologies deployed before they are truly ready cement the perception that aviation security is nothing but theater
5426826 we often forget that a technology is only as successful as the person operating it this is especially true in the aviation security sector where screeners must determine whether objects identified by screening technologies are truly dangerous
5426827 additionally passengers also play a key role in any technologys performance and success if passengers find screening technologies too cumbersome or too intrusive the consequences can ripple across the entire aviation sector tsl and tsa must work together to ensure that human factors are taken into consideration beginning in the first stages of technology development
5426828 dr hallowell has said in the past that she envisions a checkpoint of the future where no one has to empty their pockets take off their shoes or try to fit their toothpaste and deodorant into a tiny plastic bag in order to get on an airplane the committee applauds that goal and i want to work with tsl and the tsa to ensure that next generation aviation security technologies are effective and efficient while meeting the needs of all screeners and passengers
5426829 while iss has had a long and at times controversial and frustrating development path i am impressed with the progress that has been made in assembling and operating this incredibly complex international space based science and technology facility
5426830 although nasa talks about providing research opportunities on the iss we cannot forget that the funding cuts nasa has made to its microgravity research programs in recent years whether willingly or not have largely decimated that research community
5426831 i think the onus has to be on nasa to prove that it means what it says by taking meaningful steps both to make the iss a productive venue for research and to start to rebuild that research community yet it wont be possible to have a productive iss unless the facility can be sustained after the shuttle is retired
5426832 it is no secret that we are currently living with the adverse impacts of the administrations shortsighted decision four years ago to accept a four year gap in u s crew launch capabilities after the shuttle is retired i hope we learn from that experience and not let the future of the iss be determined by equally shortsighted measures
5426833 thus if we are to realize a meaningful return on the nations investment in the iss we need to ensure that the isss post shuttle logistics resupply needs are adequately funded it is also clear that it is time for the administration to commit to flying the two contingency shuttle flights that will deliver critical spares and logistics to the station before the shuttle is retired
5426834 our country has invested billions of dollars in mapping the physical terrain of combat zones based on the recognition that it would be foolhardy to send our soldiers into unknown terrain because it would endanger our soldiers and their mission
5426835 what i find so encouraging and interesting about todays hearing is the recognition that human terrain which we may not be able to map by satellite or gps is just as important to the success of our mission the survival of our soldiers and the people were trying to protect
5426836 innovation is crucial for maintaining americas competitive lead in this global economy
5426837 sbir and sttr are good economic stimulus programs that support research and innovation among our countrys leading job creators small businesses
5426838 these two programs are critical to the competitiveness of the u s
5426839 small companies are where a lot of innovation happens and we need to support these businesses to remain successful in the competitive global economy
5426840 for more than 20 years these programs have provided federal funding for companies with innovative ideas seeking to bring their products to market
5426841 todays global economy necessitated that we restructure both programs to ensure their continued effectiveness in promoting and commercializing new products

5426910 nasas exploration initiative exemplifies both the strengths and weaknesses of the agency
5426911 from its beginning nasas exploration initiative has suffered from chronic underfunding with a once in a generation project to develop a new space transportation system shoehorned into a nasa budget that in some years hasnt even kept pace with inflation
5426912 a good number of my colleagues agree with me that we should be investing more in nasa but there isnt necessarily a consensus on what those funds should be used to accomplish i think exploration is a worthwhile endeavor and i support it
5426913 however it is also clear to me that nasas core missions in aeronautics and science and especially earth science and climate research are highly relevant to addressing the nations needs and must be better supported than they have been and we need to see that nasa is exercising fiscal responsibility with its funding in all of these critical areas
5426914 we need to make sure that nasas exploration program is structured in a way that ensures that the critical long term exploration research and technology investments will be made
5426915 we need to ensure that the activities we carry out on the moon dont become a counterproductive drain on the but instead help further our long term exploration goals
5426916 i think we need to be reaching out to fashion a new internationally cooperative approach to exploration that more than any nationalistically driven competition will ensure that u s leadership in space is maintained in a way that will deliver the maximum benefits to our citizens for decades to come
5426917 since congress created usfa in the early 1970s the agency has done an excellent job in providing leadership and assistance to the nations fire service
5426918 this bill will ensure that usfa continues to provide leadership and resources to the more than 30 000 local fire departments as their communities call on them to take increasingly larger roles in disaster preparedness and response
5426919 when my mother was a young girl her home caught fire
5426920 her family was able to save their lives and just the clothes on their backs to this day she relives that memory every time she hears a fire engine siren thats part of the reason why this bill is so important to me i hope this bill will save others from enduring such a traumatic experience
5426921 this bill also recognizes the fact that over 100 firefighters lose their lives each year in the line of duty and it directs usfa to promote the adoption of voluntary national consensus standards for firefighter health and safety among fire departments around the country
5426922 instrumental in revealing the massive failings in atsdrs erroneous and completely unsubstantiated conclusion last february that the formaldehyde levels in trailers used by the federal emergency management agency to house victims of hurricanes katrina and rita
5426923 this appears to be a classic shoot the messenger response from an agency which our investigation has shown to have engaged in a scientific and management fiasco at the highest levels even when top management became aware of the problems with the original health consultation on formaldehyde in trailers it compounded this public health disaster by further inaction foot dragging and passing the buck in every direction except where it belongs in the offices of the top leadership of atsdr and cdc
5426924 by this letter we are asking that you immediately suspend the implementation of dr de rosas personal improvement plan and return dr de rosa to his previous position which he held successfully for many years we also ask that you arrange a personal meeting to explain the conduct of your agency regarding dr de rosa and how you intend to improve that record

5426931 controlling the emotional intensity of an industry is an incredibly powerful source of advantage in the post network economy but thats a small part of the reason avatars are valuable the truth is that the post network economy is an interaction economy the avatar is a focal point for interaction a sticky context independent information rich focial point which should be enough to explain why they can also be explosive focal points for value creation

5426934 as we are moving into an era where attention is the most valuable currency and the user is pummelled with more content they could possibly consume in a lifetime the strength of ones emotional connection with a service a brand or a product is of utmost importance

5426941 when i wrote after virtue what i had recognized was that the failure of the enlightenment project left open two alternatives to reconstruct the moral theory an communal practice of aristotelianism or instead to understand the failure of the enlightenment as a symptom of the impossibility of discovering any rational justification for morality as hiterto understood a sign of the truth of nietzsche so the choice posed by after virtue was aristotle or nietzsche q why not nietzsche a for two reasons one concerns nietzsche and the have spelling out detail of his genealogical project by recent followers such as micheal foucalt and giles deleuze what they have quite unintentionally put in question is the possibility of making that project sufficiently intelligible in its own terms the outcome of the unmasking of others by the genealogist seems to me to have been in the end the self unmasking of the genealogists
5426942 the fact that someone does something badly is not a reason to believe that that thing is not worthwhile

5426946 the thing that we use to describe something is totally separate from the thing we are describing and this arises from an ongoing and endless but also potentially creative destructive affective incompleteness

5426949 there is a tremendous amount of international science and technology cooperation already going on across the federal government
5426950 one of my goals for this hearing is to understand how or if the federal government sets priorities for international science cooperation and who is or who should be responsible for coordinating and overseeing the entire effort
5426951 international science and engineering partnerships a priority for u s foreign policy and our nations innovation agenda
5426952 while the state department may be at the center of many of these efforts i would be remiss to downplay the critical roles played by a number of other agencies including the nsf the mission agencies represented here today by nasa and the office of science and technology policy which has responsibility both for advising the president on the s amp t component of issues of national and international importance and for coordinating research and development activities across the federal government

5426954 in almost every respect atsdr failed to fulfill its mission to protect the public from exposure to formaldehyde at levels known to cause ill health effects
5426955 the agencys handling of this issue and their inability to correct it was the result of a collapse of senior management and leadership
5426956 the people in these trailers include the most vulnerable among us children the elderly the handicapped many of these are people who were really stuck in the trailers twenty four hours a day seven days a week children and babies breath faster than adults and are less able to process formaldehyde so it builds up in their bodies faster than in adults
5426957 these are the same populations that you might expect to be most sensitive to formaldehyde lower levels of exposure triggering stronger health reactions these are the very segments of the public that we most expect the government to act to protect
5426958 think back to when you were a child and sick the safest place to be was at home in bed but here we have a situation where the government has provided families with homes that are making children sick
5426959 where do those children go to be safe who do their families turn to for help
5426960 the tsa has admitted that these students do not fall into any of the categories it uses to determine security threats but it inexplicably refuses to change its determination
5426961 i do not understand why these students werent simply told that they were not eligible for the twic and allowed to withdraw their applications

5426976 im fortunate to have had so many incredible experiences in my life especially in these past four years if there is one thing i can take from these experiences its that life cant be planned in any way give a personal example etc in five years i see myself happy because my true happiness is the only thing i can control
5426977 the question is who ought to make that decision the congress or the commanders and as you know my position is clear im a commander guy

5427000 what can i do this is the only source of water around i could possibly boil it but that is only for drinking water what about washing my dishes
5427001 our water is safe we have a state of the art water treatment plant and we are upgrading our distribution network there is no need for alarm because the water does not have bacterial contamination
5427002 we have been installing boreholes that are between 60 and 80 metres deep but now we are considering recommending between 80 and 100 metres
5427003 it is remarkable how fast open source web technologies are maturing and being adopted in the enterprise companies large and small are switching from their legacy application infrastructure to the web and are increasingly choosing php as a key ingredient of that new architecture
5427004 the zend php conference will be the ideal meeting place to find out more about this trend it will be a unique gathering of technology and business practitioners sharing the state of the art on php related technologies and best practices like test driven development continuous integration and scalable deployment using php application servers

5427015 we teach kids to be less focused on themselves and more on the community
5427016 they spend a couple hours each week on the project the kids are learning leadership skills
5427017 we decided to exist to equip kids to think live and bring about change in a culture that says kids are going backward not forward
5427018 in doing my masters thesis i found that what makes a difference in a kids life is an adult whos truly involved we are deeply involved in their lives in discipling and mentoring them
5427019 we wanted to form a school where kate would both know others and be known in deeper life changing ways and be challenged in every part of her life
5427020 three teachers with 12 kids is a great ratio its challenging academically but also personally and spiritually its not for every kid
5427021 were preparing them for college in intense ways and theres also a decidedly spiritual component its the education you dream about for your kid a partnering of school with the home
5427022 they taught the kids how to fundraise how to write a fundraising letter how to make a call how to run an event make a budget and develop a profit and loss statement
5427023 they were an energetic group very focused on what they were doing
5427024 we had a conversation with nancy parsons and rosemary moore and talked about how the project would fit the needs of the council we came up with the baby bag project it was a wonderful experience for the council and the kids from veritas they got an up close look at the workings of a nonprofit
5427025 its wonderful for the council to have an opportunity to expose future leaders to community service and citizenship
5427026 it teaches them as kids to support those kinds of community activities

5427068 automatic reactions triggered out of unawareness usually compound and exacerbate stress making what have remained basically simple problems into worse ones each time we react we stress our internal balance even more a lifetime of unconscious reactivity is likely to increase our risk of eventual breakdown and illness
5427069 the healthy approach is to stop reacting to stress and to start responding to it this is the path of mindfulness in daily life we will eventually come to see that effective control can come out of inner calmness acceptance and openness

5427084 the white house office of management and budget omb has effectively blocked the environmental protection agency epa from posting new health assessments of hazardous chemicals by prolonging the assessments because of inevitable uncertainties about the interaction of chemicals and human health the result is confusion and uncertainty about potential health effects leaving dozens of communities in the dark about dangerous levels of toxic chemicals
5427085 maybe there should be a balance between the right of our citizens to have a clean environment and good health and the interests of a few big agencies and big industries not to have to clean up after themselves or change their habits but the white house appears to come down on the side of the polluters every time
5427086 the question isnt whether there are uncertainties in science the question is how much certainty do we need to tell people that a particular level of chemical exposure is potentially harmful with tce we have been at that point for more than two years and yet the white houses involvement guarantees no action for another two years at least this has to stop
5427087 the grouping of these phrases is not only misleading and sensationalist it practically states that trans men are human monsters

5427089 encounters are going to be much higher in the summer than in the spring fall or winter when most people are in the water
5427090 remember were guests in the ocean its a wild environment and theres more than just one of us taking advantage of those habitats at the same time
5427091 if its a matter of reservations were always crashers to the party we crash the party and in summertime we crash the party in huge huge numbers
5427092 people need to read up on the areas theyre going to
5427093 they need to be aware of their surroundings there are not safety regulations or rules that the animals have to follow weird things do happen
5427094 if theres a sandbar present bait fish will hang out inshore or closer to the beach
5427095 its not that they are attacking people because they consider them food when you get big you can bite first and decide whether you like it later
5427096 remember that you have a much bigger chance of being mauled by the neighborhood pit bull than you would by a tiger shark
5427097 the good thing is if you see a shark you should consider yourself lucky because about 85 percent of people who are bitten by sharks never see the shark coming
5427098 a lot of stingrays to avoid predators bury themselves in the sand
5427099 most encounters with stingrays result in someone stepping on them their interactions with people are negative because most encounters with stingrays result in someone stepping on them
5427100 the best thing you can do is put part of the body that was stung in water as hot as you can stand 104 to 105 degrees the heat denatures the toxin
5427101 the stingrays bury in the sand just below the surface if you shuffle your feet and you nudge them with your feet theyll skitter away because youre not pinning them down

5427124 the new yorker may think as one of their staff explained to us that their cover is a satirical lampoon of the caricature sen obamas right wing critics have tried to create but most readers will see it as tasteless and offensive and we agree
5427125 afros and ak 47s are no way to portray michelle obama add the arab garb to barack obama and you achieve a racist satire
5427126 we are just tired of the same old media bias game its always satire with people of color when youre reaffirming fears and stereotypes the new yorker is just reinforcing and profiting from divisive media
5427127 i think probably every other day now over the last couple months i see a new casual mmo or virtual world startup its been constant and what i saw was the same kind of dichotomy two types of startups therere hardcore mmo gaming guys trying to make that experience more accessible sort of like world of warcraft meets the web and the other side of the coin is a bunch of web guys who want to build a web site with virtual gifting and more gaming
5427128 i think theyre missing the larger point which is that there is no interaction on the web that is like a social game i dont mean a single player game which is based on a legacy of really only video games it doesnt last hundreds of years therere actually thousands of years of games that are primarily social activities like dancing or bowling and those are about you bonding with your friends and theres nothing like that online right now and i think the web and social networks provide a whole new medium to create something thats never been seen before

5427139 given the intensely political way in which the whitehall information machine has to operate under labour i think a conservative government would behave in precisely the same way the days of an impartial relationship between the civil service and the news media have gone and given that whitehall is no longer above the political fray i think there will never be anything but war between government spin doctors and journalists

5427153 this campaign is the opportunity the hip hop generation has been working for
5427154 this is our time to address the issues affecting our communities rising unemployment the high cost of food and housing a lack of quality public education and access to higher education the prison industrial complex and unaccountable corporate media these issues are not being addressed by either the republican or democratic nominee
5427155 ive never voted in the presidential election ive never felt strongly enough about a candidate to said rapper m1 of dead prez
5427156 i feel that now is the greatest opportunity for the hip hop community to put our collective strength and power to the test and vote for someone who represents who we are and what we stand for
5427157 its a good sign of political maturity for hip hop
5427158 there are issues weve been screaming about to the candidates and theyve ignored them whether police accountability the prison system or the war in iraq they touch the issues on the surface they talk about change but their policies are in line with bush a lot of us were turned off
5427159 more enterprises are deploying open source databases than ever before
5427160 enterprises are mainly looking to open source databases to support new applications such as web 2 0 web based applications small portal applications radio frequency identification rfid and other new workloads
5427161 every enterprise should now consider open source databases as part of its overall dbms strategy as doing this will deliver cost savings especially when supporting small to midsized applications
5427162 it costs themselves have gone up quite significantly over the years and database management costs have also grown over the years
5427163 companies are looking to contain these costs and theyre looking for alternative database options including open source
5427164 migrations are complex and no one actually has a solution where you can do a 100 migration from an oracle database or db2 to an open source database so easily
5427165 it takes a lot of effort and basically no one wants to spend a million dollars to save a million dollars
5427166 people wish they could wave a magic wand and migrate off an expensive closed source database and go open source but in reality 90 of people who ask about that dont end up migrating

5427183 the one group that would almost certainly oppose the views of 21st century evangelicals are 18th century evangelicals in state after state when colonists and americans met to debate the relationship between god and government it was the proto evangelicals who pushed the more radical view that church and state should be kept far apart
5427184 it was 18th century evangelicals who provided the political shock troops for jefferson and madison in their efforts to keep government from strong involvement with religion
5427185 modern evangelicals are certainly free to take a different course but they should realize that in doing so they have dramatically departed from the tradition of their spiritual forefathers

5427190 more than 15 000 developers participated in the beta program for zend studio for eclipse which makes it by far the largest beta test effort we have ever conducted for a commercial product
5427191 the feedback has been very positive especially from commercial users who in many cases had already standardized on eclipse as their development environment it validates our strategy to move our php ide to the open source eclipse platform
5427192 zend studio for eclipse allows all our developers to work in similar environments whether theyre working with php flex java or almost anything else
5427193 the included phpunit support and integration with features from zend framework are invaluable the ability to integrate in other eclipse plugins like mylyn soapui and subversive allow us to access all our day to day tools from the same ide
5427194 with more than 250 000 downloads since its launch in september 2007 the eclipse pdt project has had a very successful start the introduction of zends commercial ide on top of pdt further strengthens the project
5427195 the eclipse foundation is excited to see this collaboration by the eclipse and php communities rapidly gain momentum
5427196 as the traction from the pdt project indicates interest from the eclipse community in php is strong
5427197 with the release of studio zend has the opportunity to bring the sizable eclipse and php communities together by combining the best of both worlds

5427202 apple att can justify the added expense incurred in the contracting process because they are protecting over 2400 in service fees

5427303 gaos report paints a grim picture of the current state of epas library system the agencys modernization effort is characterized by poor planning failure to communicate with its employees the public or congress and failure to protect unique government assets
5427304 as a result epa library services are impaired employees will have a harder time doing their jobs and the public has lost access to government information there is only one way to describe the path to this outcome gross mismanagement gaos findings indicate epa followed a restructuring process that focused on and achieved only one goal closing libraries
5427305 the epas library system is a valuable public asset that has been built up over a period of decades and that the epa has been entrusted with protecting and preserving
5427306 one wonders whether this administrations reckless approach to closing epa libraries stems from a failure of management or a failure to appreciate the value of scientific material collected over several decades
5427307 gaos report makes it clear that epa rushed to close libraries with little notice or input and disregarded concerns raised by epa employees and in an epa report
5427308 now all who rely on epa libraries for information are paying the price epa must recognize the importance of its libraries to epa staff and the public fully consider the input of library users and ensure that the libraries are available to meet users needs
5427309 americans have a basic right to know about health and environmental hazards in their communities
5427310 in many cases the epas libraries are the only places where the public epa staff and researchers can find all the information they need to understand the risks we face from pollution epa never should have closed libraries in the first place and they should fully restore them now
5427311 performing the steps that its own study specified as necessary to ensure that the reorganization would be cost effective
5427312 epa did not effectively justify its decision to reorganize the library network

5427316 we work a lot with communities and film and weve found it really difficult to distribute video in an accessible way the clips you see on ourmedia came mainly from activists on the ground in brazil south africa and india these are people who are deeply engaged with local struggles but with little resources and power to connect with mainstream media even though they have an enormous wealth of knowledge and experiences to share ourmedia makes it possible to get these voices direct to a global community unfiltered and uncensored its a really amazing thing and such a powerful tool we love ourmedia and are so happy to have found it well be using it in the future for all sorts of activist work getting voices of people who are unheard out there for people to listen to directly

5427347 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obama s varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5427348 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5427349 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5427350 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5427351 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5427352 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home
5427353 the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5427354 sometimes its difficult to know what a politician will actually do once in office because they say different things at different times to different people

5427375 i dont think science is the only way to know the truth
5427376 well i dont have an alternative i just think there are things that science doesnt know
5427377 of course there is plenty that science doesnt know but the list of things which might be true are infintesmal only a sub set of those ideas can actually be true if we dont use the scientific method hypothesis testing evidence conclusions consensus to determine which of those ideas are actually true what alternative method do you propose
5427378 well i dont have an alternative i just well i it just seems to me that science isnt the only way i well
5427379 science is the only way to know to the truth

5427387 to rationalize the presentation of the different services to various types of mobile devices there are additional requirements for mobile integration that layer on top of other integration infrastructure services
5427388 the underlying technologies that will enable the integration infrastructure of the future you can build upon them there are many benefits to looking at this from an enterprise point of view and building an integration architecture
5427389 you dont want to for example have portals with different integration technology than your b2b integration
5427390 you want to reduce the need to integrate integration technologies
5427391 just one more reason for taking the enterprise approach to building an integration infrastructure is it enables you to look at patterns and understand the overlap among them to help you avoid costly mistakes by doing it right the first time
5427392 you want to architect things to work together from the get go
5427393 because then youll know you can manage it over time

5427436 nasas science program has long been one of the agencys crown jewels and it has delivered outstanding results since the dawn of the space age 50 years ago results that have rewritten the scientific textbooks and captivated the imagination of the public both here and around the world
5427437 i want to see that record of accomplishment and inspiration continue however im concerned that nasas science program is facing an uncertain future under the funding plan offered by the administration
5427438 i commend dr stern for his efforts to address some of the stresses facing the science community from past nasa budgetary problems and for the energy and commitment he has brought to his job yet as we heard from a number of our witnesses today it is not at all clear that it is going to be possible to sustain those new initiatives in an effective manner under the administrations assumed funding plan
5427439 nasas challenging new science initiatives are to be built on a budget that increases by only 1 through fy11 and that assumes only inflationary increases at best in the years beyond that there will be little new money instead there will be a continuing need to transfer of funds across the science accounts to support each new initiative an approach some might call robbing peter to pay paul im very concerned that such an approach will not prove sustainable or credible

5427483 theres a perception that there are more patriot act requests a lot of those powers are exercised in secret and those who receive requests are often not allowed to tell anyone so its hard to get accurate information about it
5427484 its not true everywhere that people have as much discretion as they do in the u s
5427485 but our interpretation is that for most people who retain records you have discretion to decide which records to maintain and you cant be punished for not having kept records
5427486 its not true for web publishers theyre not required to know who their readers are if they do know theyre not required to keep records

5427488 given the increase in subpoena activity the practice of logging everything is a bad practice it might be tempting for someone to try to get all that data from you

5427536 fmu president dr fred carter had this vision and its been almost 10 years ago
5427537 we have been enthused about it and energetic about til this very day
5427538 if you dont enter ready to learn you always have to struggle to catch up
5427539 so we dont want them to start behind we want them to start ready
5427540 we think that the paradigm change in this state will come about from early childhood initiatives like this
5427541 its the best economic development tool that you could have an educated work force and it starts 0 to 4
5427542 i hope that the future work accomplished here will serve to inspire the dreams of thousands of children over the years

5427558 soon nearly all information tv radio telephone and the web will be delivered via high speed broadband community internet connects rural communities attracts new businesses and serves schools libraries and public safety sectors it will make access to the information superhighway affordable and accessible to everyone
5427559 in many rural towns the local governments high speed internet offering may be its citizens only option to access the world wide web despite this situation a few incumbent providers of traditional telecommunications services have attempted to stop local government deployment of community high speed internet services the bill would do nothing to limit their ability to compete in fact the bill would provide them an incentive to enter more rural areas and deploy services in partnership with local governments
5427560 my goal in introducing this legislation is to discourage municipal governments from wasting taxpayer funds on building duplicative infrastructure while at the same time encouraging private companies to offer continually innovating service in underserved areas by removing the specter of government competition
5427561 this bill recognizes that the world has changed and consumer driven markets work better than those managed by the government
5427562 its not government involvement thats preventing broadband deployment in new york theres no competition from government and there are huge swaths of residential and commercial with no dsl or cable service these companies act from a business interest and they decided not to service these areas because theyre not profitable

5427630 2 i can buy books on impulse ive bought more books in the last few weeks on the kindle than i did in the last six months in print
5427631 3 its really fast to download and you can store a ton of books literally especially if you add a 2gb sd card to offset the cost of the sd card the books are 40 70 cheaper than their printed versions
5427632 4 i love the fact that amazon stores everything you bought and you can move easily between local memory and remote storage
5427633 5 the device is really well designed as a starting point the key button layout is a bit frustrating in the beginning but you get used to holding the kindle after reading the first couple of books and then it becomes intuitive
5427634 the kindle is a 1 0 device and has lots of problems but its good enough that you learn to overcome them to get something that will change the way you read in fact i think the kindle is a bigger breakthrough device than the iphone

5427657 the competes act clearly established congressional priorities for nist however the budget request this year largely ignored congress input the request is 28 percent lower than nists fy09 authorization
5427658 in fact nist is the only science agency included in competes whose budget request is actually lower this year than last year
5427659 the document that nist delivered falls far short of this requirement it leaves out several of nists most important programs and it does not lay out a strategic plan to ensure that nists investments are suitable for the competitive challenges of the 21 st century
5427660 i am very concerned that nist has still not developed a comprehensive programmatic planning document
5427661 competes put mep on a ten year budget path to doubling to enhance its ability to help small manufacturers modernize their operations and remain globally competitive

5427666 you get a consistent and accurate view of information across all of the management and operation processes in your organizations
5427667 the corporate finance department for example can define some calculations and then push them out to the entire organization to get consistency in how people are measuring things

5427686 the right side of the human brain in kabbalah means wisdom chokhma

5427698 ultimately they could it starts with understanding and also quite pointedly focusing on an it management market not an erp or business management market they might only get so far
5427699 theyve got some of the basic things in there to make sure their customers dont get completely steered away
5427700 erp vendors never targeted internal it until this ppm market surfaced theyre not the pure play ppm vendors in it that are looking to drive the applications portfolio

5427705 hey we just grilled some whatever and dont know what to do with all this heat leftover
5427706 back off im trying to make out with lady shyster
5427707 todays hearing is the first in a series that will study the potential that science holds for building and strengthening our relationship with other countries what better way to start than by examining and improving upon the current visa process that allows foreign students and scholars to studying in our country
5427708 all of us on this committee recognize that the federal government must protect the american people from those who seek to do us harm
5427709 however it is important that we review how the barriers we have created since 9 11 are impacting legitimate students and scholars who want to come to this country to study and scholars who want to come here for research collaborations or conferences we must also examine what we are doing or should be doing to reduce those barriers
5427710 while all of us on this committee particularly chairman gordon and dr ehlers are committed to increasing the pipeline of u s students in science and engineering fields we also recognize that this does not necessarily mean that we should turn away the best and brightest from other countries many scientists and engineers entering the u s on student and scholar visas return home and rise to prominent positions in their own countries and can serve as important advocates for the united states
5427711 in addition to improving our standing and reputation in the world foreign students help fill the talent pools that fuel innovation and keep the u s competitive foreign students also help broaden and enrich the educational experience of their peers and bring different perspectives to their disciplines and to their american colleagues often initiating new research directions that may lead to scientific or technological breakthroughs the best way to encourage that type of partnership is to improve upon our nations visa system to ensure that foreign students are able to travel to our country and study alongside american students
5427712 the mission ahead is indeed a historic one that is centered on the addition of one of europes main contributions to the iss the columbus laboratory module this addition to the iss is a significant step towards the completion of the station and i look forward to the expansion in research capabilities that this module will provide
5427713 i cannot understand how an agency charged with protecting the publics health is attempting to muzzle one of its own scientists for bringing forth critical issues that impact the health and safety of the public
5427714 this administration has pledged to ensure that federal scientists have free and unfettered access to the public and the media this certainly has not happened in the case of chris de rosa we need to ensure that retaliation against dr de rosa for blowing the whistle on important public health issues stops today and that he is protected from further retribution
5427715 public health implications of hazardous substances in the twenty six u s great lakes areas of concern
5427716 the core mission of the atsdr is to serve the public by using the best science taking responsive public health actions and providing trusted health information to prevent harmful exposures and disease related to toxic substances
5427717 while senior managers at atsdr seem to have forgotten its core task and mission dr de rosa has upheld those values in his efforts to protect the public from potential harm he has been retaliated against and demoted for his efforts we will continue to investigate these issues until we are satisfied they have been resolved we will not tolerate federal scientists being muzzled or critical public health data being buried
5427718 as chairman of the subcommittee on energy and environment i am particularly troubled by the fact that this agency has been intentionally withholding and is now diminishing a key report that could lead to a better scientific understanding of the public health implications of environmental contamination this report has been thoroughly vetted and reviewed by dozens of individuals both within atsdr and from other agencies it needs to be released in its entirety without further delay
5427719 further important public health work needed in the great lakes basin
5427720 green transportation infrastructure is a simple and exciting set of technologies that can help solve substantial pollution problems in our communities while increasing energy efficiency
5427721 we have a great opportunity in this country to manage and protect our water resources through the use of innovative techniques and technologies that simultaneously serve as transportation infrastructure and as means for managing and filtering storm water and this bill works to overcome the barriers stopping us from getting there
5427722 since congress created usfa in the early 1970s it has done an excellent job in providing leadership and assistance to the nations fire service and the number of fatalities in the u s due to fire has decreased significantly over that time however u s fire deaths and property losses are still among the highest in the industrial world this bill will ensure that usfa continues to provide leadership and resources to the more than 30 000 local fire departments as their communities call on them to take increasingly larger roles in disaster preparedness and response
5427723 their job is part law enforcement part first responder part diplomat and part detective it is clear that these agents need the help of new technology to do their jobs better and to make our borders more secure this bill has special importance for me as these technologies help reinforce security efforts at ports in addition to land borders the port of portland processed more than fourteen million tons of cargo in 2007 and i know that the hardworking officers managing security there could use the assistance these innovative technologies would provide
5427724 as we pause to recognize the american space program and all that has been accomplished over the past five decades since explorer i we cannot help but acknowledge the countless ways it has benefited our nation a healthy and active space program breeds innovation and strengthens the scientific technological and engineering foundation that is crucial to our economic growth and global competitiveness
5427725 we must make a commitment to continue to invest in our space program so that we can look forward to another fifty years of u s achievements in space exploration and continued leadership in science and technology
5427726 nasa officials have repeatedly said that they have no intention of validating or analyzing the data collected therefore we request that the government accountability office gao which employs experts in survey methodology statistical analysis and aviation policy use the unredacted set of data collected by the naoms project and promptly provide the committee with an appropriate analysis of this data
5427727 for example we believe that rates of event occurrence can be calculated based on the information contained in sections a and b of the unredacted data such calculations could provide insight into the accuracy of faa data reporting systems the accuracy of the naoms survey itself and may point to important safety issues that would require further study
5427728 this matter is a very high priority for the committee and the flying public
5427729 when the public pays for five years of government work designed to help us improve flying safety i think the public deserves to get a report back on what was learned nasa wont do the work so i am asking the gao to bring back some answers to the committee that we can then share with the country
5427730 could materially affect the public confidence in and the commercial welfare of the air carriers
5427731 today the administration submitted its fiscal year 2009 budget request to congress while the almost 3 11 trillion budget includes 147 billion for r amp d it proposes an incomplete and short sighted plan to promote u s competitiveness
5427732 last august congress passed and the president signed into law the america competes act competes a response to the 2005 national academies report rising above the gathering storm and supported by a wide range of u s industries universities and science organizations competes seeks to ensure u s students teachers businesses and workers will continue leading the world in innovation research and technology well into the future
5427733 competes will assure that our nation produces not just the worlds leading scientists and engineers but the technical workers needed in all sectors of the economy thats why the law authorizes increased funding for basic research and early career scientists as well as robust k 12 math and science education programs at nsf and other agencies
5427734 the presidents budget boosts funding for basic research at nsf but doesnt make education a priority robert noyce scholarships and math and science partnerships to train stem teachers and students are underfunded by more than 100 million and 60 million respectively the president noted in his state of the union address that u s math scores among some students were up however according to the most recent indicators u s high school students rank 25 th out of 30 developed countries in math and 21 st out of 30 in science there is more work to be done and underfunding competes initiatives doesnt help in that effort
5427735 competes also seeks to ensure that u s companies and small businesses lead the world in innovation and create jobs in the process since taking office this administration has overseen the loss of 3 4 million manufacturing jobs with 217 000 jobs lost in 2007 alone and manufacturing employment in the u s now stands at its lowest point since 1950 competes seeks to reverse this trend with robust funding for the manufacturing extension partnership mep and technology innovation program tip formerly atp both of which have proven track records for return on investment and job creation however the administrations budget phases out mep and eliminate tip immediately these are good american job creators this budget is putting in jeopardy
5427736 finally competes seeks to help reduce our energy dependence and address global climate change through an advanced research projects agency energy arpa e modeled after the department of defenses successful darpa program arpa e is charged with rapidly developing and commercializing transformational clean energy technologies
5427737 the new proposals in the administrations budget with regard to energy are nothing new at all and simply miss the point instead of showing true leadership in energy research by establishing arpa e the administration points in this budget to a few existing programs and a vague policy statement as a sufficient alternative arpa e should be a small but aggressive new program that reports directly to the secretary pursues truly cross cutting research that does not fit into the current bureaucratic research departments and extends federal energy research funding beyond the national laboratories to academia and the private sector
5427738 the president is right that basic research included in his american competitiveness initiative aci is important to our economy and our future but hes undoubtedly wrong that we dont also need an educated workforce an investment in small manufacturers that create jobs and a commitment to cutting edge research
5427739 last year the president threatened to veto appropriations bills that would have come much closer to fully funding competes as well as his aci the administration should listen to the businesses and educators and scientists and engineers in this country and support full funding of competes this year
5427740 i am deeply troubled by the rumors reported in the press today concerning the futuregen project if true withdrawal of doe support for this project represents a dramatic departure from one of this administrations most visible and ambitious energy and climate initiatives
5427741 for five years the administration has touted the prospective benefits of futuregen and congress has provided funds to move this project forward over this time period congress has allocated 173 million in taxpayer dollars to this program now we hear through the rumor mill that doe may be abandoning this program at a time when the u s should be investing heavily in carbon neutral energy technologies
5427742 if the department has serious concerns about futuregen doe should come up to capitol hill and talk to us about it this is not something that should be simply included in the overall presentation of the 2009 budget request congress and the public deserve far better justification analysis and consultation before decisions on investments of this magnitude and importance are made
5427743 you can expect that this committee will exercise its oversight role and determine the current status and plans for this program
5427744 when an unexpected tragedy of the magnitude of columbia occurs its up to us as a nation to mourn our loss assess what went wrong and work to assure it doesnt happen again the u s space program continues to be the envy of the world and that is due in large part to heroic pioneers like the men and women aboard columbia challenger and apollo i we honor their service and we are ever mindful of their sacrifice as we move forward in our exploration of space
5427745 no one ever said that space exploration would be easy or without danger but as a nation we dont shirk from the risks because we firmly believe that exploring space is something worth doing when commander rick husband and his crew made the ultimate sacrifice five years ago today we were again reminded of the dangers of exploration on this anniversary we also remember their passion and dedication and it this legacy that inspires us to explore further learn more and work hard to ensure that the u s remains the world leader in space exploration
5427746 it appears that energysolutions exploitation of a loophole in our countrys nuclear waste regulatory framework and its agreement with the compact could put the u s on a path to becoming the worlds nuclear garbage waste dump
5427747 i refuse to believe this was the intention of the compact when the 1998 approval was granted
5427748 it is highly likely that this is the first application with a string to follow
5427749 the u s already faces capacity issues and other challenges in treating and disposing of radioactive waste produced domestically
5427750 we should be working on solving this problem at home before taking dangerous waste from around the world
5427751 on january 31 1958 the u s successfully launched its first satellite into space and began a 50 year journey of exploration and achievement in space that continues to this day yet the launch of explorer i was not just a photo op explorer i carried a scientific package that included a cosmic ray detector and marked the first ever use of a satellite to carry out scientific research in outer space because of that detector developed by dr james van allen of the university of iowa the united states made a significant discovery about the earths environment namely the discovery of regions of energetic charged particles trapped in the earths magnetic field later referred to as the van allen radiation belts
5427752 im pleased to be an original cosponsor of this resolution
5427753 our space program is one of the crown jewels of the nations r amp d enterprise and we need to work hard to ensure that the next 50 years of americas efforts in space will continue to deliver significant benefits to our citizens inspire our young people and push back the frontiers of our knowledge
5427754 i think that americas space program has been a vital contributor to the nations well being and standing in the world as well as to significant scientific and technological advances over the last five decades it is fitting and proper that we pause to celebrate and honor the anniversary of explorer i and the birth of the u s space program and to rededicate ourselves to the pursuit of a robust and vital space program over the next fifty years
5427755 the most vital area up for grabs is the combined customer base of the merging companies as anyone who has gone through an integration process can attest attention very easily gets diverted in a merger it might mean customers calls go unreturned or maybe pricing gets ratcheted up even if these scenarios dont develop clients may habitually think about alternatives as a precaution
5427756 all these grand challenge problems share a few key characteristics they are very very difficult requiring heroic breakthroughs from groups in multiple disciplines working closely together around the world they must have a significant scientific economic and or social impact but perhaps most important they must capture our imaginations so we become enthralled by the possibilities and find within ourselves something that lets us achieve the near impossible
5427757 applying technology to human based organizations of all kinds thus transforming the very nature of enterprises economies and work itself
5427758 the nation and its political leaders have begun to sour on the notion that the current market system is the key to a fair stable and efficient society

5427762 if you miss a loan payment you hurt your credit rating if you miss a payment on a 401 k loan it is considered to be in default
5427763 under many plans a defaulted loan is considered a taxable distribution and it will immediately trigger an income tax on the total amount of the loan
5427764 while this might mean that some employees would not contribute quite as much to their 401 k plans it would also mean that what they did contribute would be there for retirement
5427765 the benefits of the eclipse platform closely match the needs of the modern web application developer
5427766 eclipse provides first class multi language support has an extensible architecture and is supported by a vibrant open source community in zend studio for eclipse we enhance eclipse pdt by delivering key capabilities for commercial php development such as refactoring unit testing profiling and integration with zend framework
5427767 an important goal of the eclipse foundation is to support commercial products built on the eclipse infrastructure and this is the newest offering that helps bring the millions of php programmers into the eclipse community
5427768 we are happy see zend commercialize eclipse pdt with their zend studio for eclipse product
5427769 there is little debate that the eclipse community is increasingly the center of gravity with respect to professional development tooling
5427770 by aligning itself with the eclipse platform zend is at once bringing php to entirely new audiences and giving existing php developers access to an immense volume of plug ins and tools

5427791 ill have here insert whichever order you like here whether at a restaurant in a shop at a hotel in a museum
5427792 one reason is that third party tools provide useful functionality that oracle tools dont provide
5427793 its rarely the case anymore that companies use only one platform
5427794 most enterprises dont have the luxury of employing an oracle dba a sybase dba an sql server dba and so on so third party tools are very attractive
5427795 sql developer is becoming a much stronger and more feature oriented product but it still cant compare to toad which is the most widely adopted third party tool
5427796 its easy to use across the platforms and is a very good tool for developers and dbas
5427797 a lot of times these products are licensed by the number of databases you have so as your company expands youll have to fork over more money in licensing fees to third party vendors
5427798 youre going to need personnel with training in the third party tool and youre probably going to have to buy some sort of service contract
5427799 we arent using any third party dba tools simply because we dont have the time to develop the expertise and manage all the different features
5427800 with grid control you can get your arms around a large group of databases no matter where they are

5427809 remote sensing touches on an area that has great relevance for the lives of our citizens here in colorado as well as for the lives of folks all across america
5427810 remote sensing data collected from commercial and government spacecraft and aircraft have been used to provide societal benefits help strengthen our national defense and protect our homeland
5427811 drought the pine beetle infestation and fire have wreaked havoc on our communities and our environment
5427812 we are in an appropriate place to discuss these issues as colorado is leading the way in remote sensing technology not only is our state the center of gravity for commercial remote sensing activity but our government officials are also on the cutting edge of using this technology to help our citizens
5427813 while todays hearing was a bit colorado centric i can tell you that in my congressional district along floridas space coast we have experienced a dramatic rise in population over the last two decades as a consequence of this growth ensuring timely emergency response services measuring land use and impacts and preserving adequate fresh water sources are considerations that now control much of our future development
5427814 in colorado springs we have realized that remote sensing technology and geospatial information are key tools in improving our ability to shape the environment that we operate in we now rely on these tools to help us prepare and plan for potential hazard and risk events communicate with our citizens and adjacent emergency response agencies and make the right decisions while deploying in initial attack or during sustained operations during a large scale wild fire
5427815 federal investment in research and development has and continues to be a significant driver in the growth and expansion of the nations geospatial information industry drcog and its member governments leverage this investment in significant ways on a daily basis
5427816 remote sensing methods are effective tools to assess fire forest pest and forest conditions one of the benefits of using remote sensing data over data acquired by other techniques is the spatial precision which allows for the analysis of other resource concerns helping to reduce analysis time and improve overall planning productivity
5427817 replacing on the ground reconnaissance with satellite based information is highly beneficial in terms of efficient water management efficient use of limited resources and improved decision making
5427818 is to serve the public by using the best science taking responsive public health actions and providing trusted health information to prevent harmful exposures and disease related to toxic substances
5427819 the leadership of this agency appears not to have understood their mission on more than one occasion cancelling or limiting tests for toxic substances because of political pressure is incompatible with their duty to conduct independent scientifically rigorous health investigations the american people expect and deserve better and so does congress
5427820 throughout the years earth day has been a successful way to raise awareness and encourage action on critical environmental issues such as air pollution protection of parks and wildlife and recycling while great progress has been made today our country is faced with threats to global energy supplies rising costs of energy to consumers and growing impacts from global climate change this earth day should serve as a rallying call for increased investment in ground breaking science based technology solutions to address our energy and environmental problems
5427821 earth day is an important opportunity to be proud of the environmental progress weve made but also to refocus on the work that remains to be done
5427822 i was proud to introduce this resolution which expresses our gratitude to the organizers and participants in this years earth day celebrations who are working so hard for a healthy environment
5427823 coral reefs provide economic environmental and cultural benefits to millions of people around the world and are vital in protecting shorelines and supporting coastal economies
5427824 today i applaud house passage of h res 1112 a resolution i introduced with congressman mark kirk that increases public awareness about the grave threats to the worlds coral reefs and recognizes 2008 as the international year of the reef
5427825 in celebration of earth day it is only fitting that we recognize landsat and its 35 year record of space based observations of the earth at a time when we are beginning to address the current and future implications of climate change
5427826 landsat has been instrumental in studying the effects of land use change and data from the satellites have helped us better understand many areas along with climate change including fire preparedness natural resource management land use planning cartography and food security
5427827 we have to recognize there are roughly seven billion workers in the world half of whom make less than 2 a day we cannot and would not want to compete with that
5427828 we have to compete at a higher level with a better equipped and skilled workforce than that of our global counterparts
5427829 this is not just an idle thought for those of us who have kids and grandkids i am very concerned that the next generation of americans could be the first generation of americans to inherit a national standard of living less than their parents if we dont do something
5427830 competes will not only give our teachers and students the support they need but it also advance this nation scientifically technologically and strategically in a manner that strengthens our economy and assures that our country can continue to be a leader in the global marketplace
5427831 it is discussion and resulting actions like the ones here at the american museum of natural history this week that can bring our countrys best and brightest together and push our nation down the path to scientific and educational excellence
5427832 these two programs are critical to the competitiveness of the u s
5427833 in todays economy small businesses are where innovation happens this subcommittee intends to promote the science and technology research that drives an innovation based economy
5427834 sbir and sttr are key components of our innovation agenda
5427835 for more than 20 years these programs have helped companies with innovative ideas bring their products to market however much has changed in recent decades and these programs need to be restructured to reflect the current global innovation environment
5427836 this legislation demonstrates congress commitment to promoting the fundamental science and technology components that drive the development of new technology
5427837 this subcommittee has been a leader in advancing our innovation agenda and we have continued that leadership today by reauthorizing sbir and sttr
5427838 climate change is a tremendous environmental challenge if we are to meet this challenge new low to no emission technologies are absolutely necessary our ability to rely upon coal to produce electricity depends upon the successful development and deployment of carbon capture and sequestration systems for the last five years the administration has told us that futuregen was the key project that would move coal fired electricity production forward but now they are telling us we must go in a new direction
5427839 we must have a comprehensive well managed and coordinated research development and demonstration program to ensure we design the most effective technology strategy forward to help solve the climate change problem
5427840 we all know that coal supplies approximately 50 of the electricity in the united states but we also know that coal fired power plants contribute considerably to our greenhouse gas emissions if we need coal for power then we need technology solutions to burn it more cleanly because the problem of climate change is real
5427841 i think it is unfortunate that the department chose to make this sudden shift in the futuregen program with no congressional consultation i am very concerned that this major revision of futuregen will delay our development of these technologies which in my opinion is terribly unwise i believe that investment in advanced technologies such as renewables increased energy efficiency and carbon sequestration are integral pieces in reducing our greenhouse gas emissions we cannot afford to take any steps backwards in our federal initiatives to address the challenge of climate change
5427842 the term revolutionary technology has become a clich but nanotechnology truly is revolutionary we stand at the threshold of an age in which materials and devices can be fashioned atom by atom to satisfy specified design requirements nanotechnology based applications are arising that were not even imagined a decade ago
5427843 the range of potential applications is broad and will have enormous consequences for health care and medicine water purification and electronics to name a few examples indeed the scope of this technology is so broad as to leave virtually no product untouched
5427844 nanotechnology is one of the next frontiers of science and research and this field directly impacts all sectors of society from health care to energy to national security
5427845 i am honored to have led a series of hearings on the commercialization of nanotechnology the importance of educating students about the nanotechnology field and the potential environmental and health risks of nanotechnology i am pleased to take part in this full committee hearing today on the nni i look forward to working with chairman gordon on the reauthorization bill and to ensuring that the federal government remains an important partner in our countrys efforts to stay at the forefront of this unique and cutting edge science
5427846 the cooperation and planning processes among the participating agencies in the nni have been largely effective the nni has led to productive cooperative research efforts across a spectrum of disciplines and it has established a network of national facilities for support of nanoscale research and development
5427847 although the nni has from its beginnings realized the need to include activities for increasing understanding of the environmental and safety aspects of nanotechnology it has been slow to put in place a well designed adequately funded and effectively executed research program to address this issue
5427848 the environmental and safety component of nni must be improved by quickly developing and implementing a strategic research plan that specifies near term and long term goals sets milestones and timeframes for meeting near term goals clarifies agencies roles in implementing the plan and allocates sufficient resources to accomplish the goals

5427854 with the zend offerings on i5 os our customers are benefiting from the breath of skills open community applications and ecosystem that surrounds php
5427855 we are pleased to continue and deepen our collaboration with ibm to benefit and support i5 os users we recognize that php plays a vital role for businesses running i5 os by allowing them to leverage and extend their i5 os investments
5427856 i am so sorry about what happened yesterday with that lame attempt at humor i just really fell over myself in making it appear that i wished barack obama harm or any other candidate for that matter
5427857 and now we have what uh some are reading as
5427858 many of us are losing our heads so its not really that bad
5427859 i said a stupid thing and i am sincerely sorry for my words
5427860 somebody who can take her into a room and only he comes out

5427862 i sincerely apologize to everyone for my offensive statement as i know that all good americans were offended

5427868 tom we are dealing with a person who thinks that it is a laudible feminist act of independence to lie to and cheat on the man she married and who was financially supporting her without first negotiating an open agreement
5427869 that is one hell of a statement to come from a self proclaimed feminist or do you not actually believe that all women are people
5427870 this is true but deceiving your partner into thinking you are monogamous when you are not is not feminism it is just being a liar and sleeping around doesnt make you a feminist
5427871 hello i was going to order dinner at the diner and the special is whispering pork chops i really dont want to offend anyone so do you have any suggestions about how i should order
5427872 westaff has been a provider of quality caring santas for over 40 years
5427873 part of our advice to our santas is that they should be mindful of children having their first santa experience we ask our santas to try techniques such as lowering their tone of voice and using ha ha ha to encourage the children to come forward and meet santa we wish you and your family a very merry christmas
5427874 we are talking about little kids who do not understand that ho ho ho has any other connotation and nor should they leave santa alone
5427875 there is no stronger tradition for children than santas ho ho ho
5427876 myer has not directed our santas to refrain from using ho ho ho and believe the expression is an important christmas tradition
5427877 if this helps i am not offended by the fact that you are offended by the fact that that other guy was offended

5427882 nasas neo survey program is our insurance policy against getting taken by surprise by an incoming asteroid much progress has been made in detecting and cataloging the largest neos over the last decade however much more remains to be done
5427883 we need to survey the smaller but still potentially hazardous asteroids that could do significant damage if they impact or explode above the earths surface while the probability of such a direct hit is low we in congress have a responsibility for the safety of american citizens and we have directed nasa to come up with a survey plan nasa didnt deliver a plan that would get the job done i will continue to work with nasa and hold the agency accountable until their plan is complete
5427884 we need to survey potentially hazardous asteroids that are smaller than the ones cataloged to date but which could do significant damage if they collide with the earth
5427885 that is why congress directed nasa to plan develop and implement a neo survey program for objects as small as 140 meters in size in the nasa authorization act of 2005 i am very concerned that nasas report to congress failed to provide a recommended option and budget plan for such a survey as directed by the act as committee chairman it is my responsibility to make certain that this plan is completed and i will continue to closely monitor nasas work until it is finished

5427915 este trastorno es causado por una combinaci n de factores gen ticos heredados y el entorno de la persona especialmente el entorno familiar

5427926 i want to congratulate the men and women of darpa who have been on the vanguard of our nations technological superiority for a half century historically darpa defied conventional thinking and pursued cutting edge and some might say far out research for the department of defense which resulted in some of the most transformational technologies of our time
5427927 it is the culture of innovation at darpa that has made it so successful and unique and the talented and passionate staff is the heart of that culture its time we take the darpa model and apply it to the most pressing challenge we face today energy with adequate funding and forward thinking leadership arpa e might be celebrating the same level of revolutionary results 50 years from now
5427928 an anathema to the conventional military r amp d structure and a deliberate counterpoint to traditional thinking and approaches
5427929 i remember as a child looking on in both fear and wonder at the blinking red light of sputnik as it flew overhead everyone knew then that the u s was on the cusp of a new era and we wasted no time building up our technological defenses with such groundbreaking programs as darpa
5427930 while the adversary may have changed over 50 years the imperative to constantly evolve the u s science and technology enterprise has not given the geopolitical instabilities that threaten global energy supplies the skyrocketing costs of energy to consumers the looming threat of global climate change and the resulting costs from the likely regulation of carbon dioxide emissions there is a critical need for ground breaking science based energy solutions that can be deployed in the marketplace the status quo in energy is simply unsustainable i believe that to move away from the status quo we must rethink the federal governments approach to energy technology development and establish an arpa e
5427931 one thing that makes the darpa approach so unique in the government research enterprise is their willingness to take big chances on untested technological hunches with potentially huge impacts because of this tolerance of failure darpa undoubtedly had more misfires than sure shots but such risks were justifiable even if just a small percentage of projects proved viable that is where i feel we are with energy
5427932 with scale and complexity of the energy challenge just one arpa e discovery deployed in the energy marketplace could make the whole program worthwhile it is darpas powerful combination of a spirit of innovation mixed with a solid marketplace understanding that i hoped to capture in establishing arpa e nothing like this currently exists within the department of energy nor is the existing organizational structure at the department conducive to this sort of cross cutting multi disciplinary research approach to energy systems this is a bold step but that is what it will take to surmount our greatest energy challenges
5427933 for the first time in decades we are witnessing a renewed interest in nuclear power production in our country higher prices for fossil fuels federal incentives for nuclear power authorized in the energy policy act of 2005 the safe operating record of existing nuclear power plants and the possibility of a national cap on greenhouse gas emissions all are motivating this renewed interest
5427934 the technical challenges of expanded nuclear power production should be met with an aggressive research and development program and the national academy of sciences has done a good job of identifying research and policy priorities
5427935 as we all know federal resources are limited and we need to be prudent about how we use taxpayer dollars advancing new nuclear technologies will be expensive and we need to proceed carefully i agree that we should remain open to new nuclear technologies including nuclear waste reprocessing but we need to be sure the economics and environmental benefits are worth the cost
5427936 i believe that we must maintain a diverse and robust energy production portfolio in the united states we need reliable and affordable electricity generation to maintain our quality of life and ensure we remain globally competitive we must have a strategy that maintains our economic viability without turning a blind eye to the tremendous challenge of climate change
5427937 the details of a national climate change program are not yet clear but i believe it is critical that we have a comprehensive and meaningful technology strategy to ensure we can meet targeted reductions of greenhouse gas emissions in a rapid timeframe nuclear power may very well play an important part of the climate change solution

5428064 as my committee has discovered first hand the groundbreaking efforts of the ipcc over the past year has provided us with greater knowledge tools and proof than ever before to combat this alarming climate change phenomenon last month the ipcc completed its 4th assessment report when governments agreed to the summary report in spain their work has provided us with substantial evidence that climate change is underway and that if we fail to take action the consequences could be very serious especially for our children and grandchildren and their future by focusing on long term voluntary aspirational goals the current administrations policy on climate change puts the u s on course to take a backseat in combating the climate crisis and thats not a role im comfortable with the conference in bali is critical to the development of a cohesive world wide response to the threat posed by climate change it is our chance as a global community to establish a clear roadmap for future action the u s has led the world through other tough challenges i am confident that if we apply our entrepreneurial spirit and innovative skills to this problem we can lead the world to a solution on climate change
5428065 i used comic life on my mac exclusively to lay out the storyboards then later when i created and colored all 24 pages of the issue
5428066 being an illustrator it saved me quite a bit of time from having to lay all the text bubbles out manually it made the process of actually creating the comic that much more enjoyable
5428067 this is a great start to an important mission i am pleased that a group of schoolteachers from my district in tennessee were able to witness this exciting launch so that they can carry that excitement back to their classrooms and help their students understand that studying math and science can help prepare them for challenging and important careers whether in space or back here on earth
5428068 the endeavour mission marks another important milestone in the ongoing assembly of the international space station and i want to wish the crew a safe journey and a successful mission space exploration is an investment in our future and this mission is a very visible symbol of what can be accomplished
5428069 with the delivery of the japanese kibo laboratory the international space station will have crossed an important threshold now that each of the iss international partners laboratories will be in orbit i look forward to the expansion in research capabilities that this lab will provide and to a continuation of the spirit of productive international cooperation that made it possible
5428070 they are reading about it a lot their children are using it
5428071 and they are finding that the social media networks are too big to ignore
5428072 they are putting significant money in which is very telling
5428073 it shows that there are traditional companies looking into social networks and seeing it as a vibrant media to connect with customers
5428074 for them it was a nervous step because they have never had a true social network experience
5428075 i think we have seen a trend where traditional companies are beginning to shift and realize that they need to go where the customer is
5428076 and id rather see commercials targeted at me as opposed to some random stuff
5428077 as an advertiser you want to have your brand inserted into the online conversation that is already taking place

5428082 each group continued to receive exxon funding in 2007 after the companys first announcement that it would discontinue the payments exxon did not immediately return calls seeking comment on how serious it was in following through on its plans
5428083 while the science and technology committee has not yet had an opportunity to review the findings of the 2008 science and engineering indicators i think we can all agree that the u s needs to remain vigilant about our competitiveness in the 21st century global marketplace
5428084 the america competes act signed into law last august was a great step toward more funding for the basic research that underpins our economic growth and toward a highly skilled science and technology workforce that will help keep the highest paying jobs here in the u s however as demonstrated by this years omnibus budget we still have our work cut out for us i welcome the ongoing input of the national science board and look forward to reviewing this years indicators

5428088 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs and others begins
5428089 religious beliefs are sacred to people and at all times should be respected and honored
5428090 as a civil rights activist of the past 40 years i cannot support a show that disrespects those beliefs and practices
5428091 this is 100 percent having to do with his faith of scientology he has no problem and hes cashed plenty of checks with our show making fun of christians

5428096 we have not continually driven innovation in our display business
5428097 this is changing things quite dramatically at the margin and exposing the complacency of the early leaders
5428098 all these guys are facing world class cases of the innovators dilemma

5428107 the most blatant display of unbridled egomania comes of course from daniel who simply cannot control his ecstasy when his spiritual advisor fr
5428108 now im not at all sure i would take the advice of a spiritual advisor who looks like a hybrid of jesse ventura and uncle fester and who with his big fat stomach couldnt carry jesus cross 20 feet but daniel doesnt need to be told twice

5428112 gaos assessment is a mix of good news and not so good news
5428113 on the one hand gao has concluded that nasa is taking steps to demonstrate that the ares i project is achievable within the constraints that the project faces on the other hand gao has identified a number of significant challenges that will have to be overcome if the project is to succeed
5428114 continued instability in the design of the orion crew exploration vehicle clv is hampering the ares i projects efforts to establish firm requirements the aggressive j 2x upper stage engine development schedule is not synchronized with the rest of the project and it is unclear if nasa has allocated sufficient funding to the project
5428115 nasa establish a sound business case for ares i before proceeding beyond preliminary design review now set for july 2008 and if necessary delay the preliminary design review until the projects readiness to move forward is demonstrated
5428116 the administration has undertaken a major new exploration initiative on a business as usual budget and thats going to make it difficult for nasa to succeed the cev and ares i development projects will be important early tests of the administrations approach and the committee will be actively monitoring the status of those projects over the coming months

5428132 i was excited to start a new adventure you know
5428133 it s hard to believe it s been ten years
5428134 i had it yesterday with the players and the day before with my staff
5428135 you have the normal administrative stuff that you go through every year that they kind of nod through
5428136 and in a very realistic approach we ve been close the last couple years and haven t been able to finish the deal so i believe we have a good football team and now it s up to all of us to really work very very hard and do the best job we can do as coaches and players and that s really the speech and without getting into other things i can t really talk about they re a very responsive group i like how they started practice today and they ll work hard they want to do well the seahawks havent been able to repeat their great 2005 06 super bowl season finding instead that early playoff exits and half meaningful division wins are wholly unsatisfying several offensive personnel issues iffy receivers from a depth perspective an indifferent running game and an offensive line that has lived up to the name have been dealt with in the offseason position coach mike solari and left guard will try and set the line right former cowboys running back t j duckett will endeavor to replace the singular production of the now departed shaun alexander with a committee approach and at least four young receivers are jostling for space at the top of the depth chart behind nate burleson the receiver corps is the most interesting problem at this point supposed 1 receiver floyd womack for the teams injury prize engram the nonpareil possession receiver who set a team record with 94 catches in 2007 is unhappy with his current contract hed like an extension past this year but hes forgoing the holdout role in favor of proving himself at age 35 given the recent successes of tim brown jerry rice and joey galloway at that age the odds dont seem as long as they might have a decade ago well i think bobby s an outstanding person i ve said that before
5428137 if you said okay what s your biggest question going into now
5428138 with a young player who you are counting on i have in my mind how i m going to use him what in a perfect world would i like to see happen and we have talked to every one of those players about what we expect that way and now i watch those guys in practice

5428144 the extensive three and a half decade record of landsat data has allowed scientists to study changes to the earths land cover over time including changes influenced by both human and natural causes the applied uses of the data have served numerous purposes including natural resource management land use planning cartography and food security to cite just a few examples the data collected through the landsat program are being used by many federal agencies academic institutions state county and local governments private industry foreign governments and non governmental organizations the broad application of these data for scientific and societal benefit testifies to the nations sound investment in a public good i think it is important for this body to express our collective thanks to the many scientists engineers and program personnel who have contributed to landsats success over the past three and a half decades as a result of their efforts landsat data has become an indispensable source for a host of beneficial applications that have improved our quality of life and enhanced our economic vitality in addition landsat data are important scientifically for example the u s climate change science program has recognized the significance of the landsat program noting that landsat data are invaluable for studying the land surface and how it affects and is affected by climate i urge my colleagues to join me in ensuring that the benefits that are possible from civil space based land observations as well as from commercially available remote sensing systems continue to be realized by supporting the research technology education and tools required to improve landsat data collection and applications we can look forward to further scientific advancements and societal benefits from this critical national asset
5428145 im sure we will emerge here with the strongest ticket in the history of the libertarian party
5428146 i want everybody to remember that we only have 163 days to win this election we cannot waste one single day
5428147 while republicans and democrats will fight for their own power in november libertarians will fight for americans bob barr is one of the strongest candidates in the partys 37 year history and we look for him to have an enormous impact in the 2008 race republicans and democrats have good reason to fear a candidate like barr who refuses to accept the business as usual attitude of the current political establishment americans want and need another choice and that choice is bob barr
5428148 like any great american success story root has created a carapace of legend around himself the truth of which is a little hard to know
5428149 if the campaign is just a way to drum up business he really is the perfect candidate for the libertarian party

5428153 it is clear that nanotechnology can offer this nation and our entire world tremendous gains in the production of renewable energies life saving drugs and new technologies that will protect us against chemical or biological agents
5428154 that is why federal investment in basic research is critical to nanotechnologys development unfortunately this investment will be squandered if we do not successfully cultivate the technology into usable products or processes
5428155 certainly the commercialization of nanotechnology like any developing technology is complex
5428156 however nanotechnology has some unique challenges the development of nanomaterials and devices most often requires highly specialized and expensive instruments in addition the scale up of nanotechnology requires unique processes that have very low error rates furthermore quality control in nanomanufacturing requires lengthy evaluations and expensive equipment
5428157 that coupled with interest in alternative operating systems is suppressing development activity and that in turn will further erode vistas acceptance
5428158 this is a fiscally responsible budget that invests in proven programs to boost economic growth and spur innovation
5428159 as we all know the global marketplace continues to become more competitive and our country cannot and should not compete with the rest of the world on wages when half of the worlds workers earn less than 2 a day our country needs to compete at a higher level with better skills and higher productivity thats what the america competes act is all about and im pleased to see this budget resolution make u s competitiveness and education a high priority
5428160 the house should provide sufficient funding so that our nation may continue to be the world leader in education innovation and economic growth
5428161 will keep us on a path toward doubling funding for the national science foundation basic research in the physical sciences and collaborative research partnerships and toward achieving energy independence through the development of clean and sustainable alternative energy technologies

5428193 web 2 0 is so ill defined and people are still using it to experiment rather than with a definitive purpose
5428194 we remain deeply concerned that the conflict in darfur in western sudan continues unabated and at the localised conflict in several places which threatens stability and the sustainability of peace

5428222 oecds report identifies critical environmental issues facing our country and countries around the world this year the science and technology committee will be doing our part to help address these issues
5428223 the committee has already moved h r 906 the global change research and data management act which refocuses the u s global change research program to provide better data about the impacts of climate change at the federal state and local levels we are in desperate need of user friendly economic and technical information about concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and how the environment is responding this data is critical to designing cost effective policies to achieve reductions implement mitigation strategies and adapt to the impacts of climate change h r 906 passed the house as part of the broader energy bill last year but was not included in the final legislation i am hopeful that the house will take up this important legislation again
5428224 this year the committee will also look at a range of issues related to water supply water management water quality and the importance of water to the functioning of our economy and to the production of energy already agriculture energy production and industrial processes consume enormous quantities of water frequent and intense droughts are affecting increasing areas of the country and growing communities are demanding access to safe drinking water the committee will review these issues and how new technologies can help address issues such as desalination recycling and conservation and improved efficiency of water use
5428225 and the committee plans to convene hearings and advance legislation to increase efforts addressing the environmental implications of electronic waste e waste from computers televisions cell phones and other electronic equipment all of which are made up of a variety of hazardous chemicals and materials the committee may look at r amp d to develop alternative non toxic materials for use in electronic devices e waste recycling technologies product design that minimizes use of toxic material and disposal load and the establishment of criteria to characterize e waste
5428226 we will conduct the gay pride on the day of the eurovision final on 16 may 2009
5428227 as usual we will notify moscow authorities about the conduct of the event
5428228 we hope that the many gays and lesbians who usually attend eurovision finals from different countries will join our pride
5428229 russia must show that it is part of the civilized world of the european family that it is tolerant and that it is possible to conduct public actions of sexual minorities in moscow
5428230 though i am glad to see the administration is demonstrating a better understanding of the need for research and development in support of homeland security goals by increasing its requests for both the s amp t directorate and dndo i am disappointed that many of the issues that arose during last years budget hearing remain unresolved
5428231 state and local officials especially first responders a crucial part of our domestic security enterprise continue to feel that they are shut out of the process of identifying gaps in capabilities and setting research priorities
5428232 i want to be assured that theres an action plan for how the s amp t directorate and dndo will ensure that stakeholders outside of dhs are fully integrated into the research planning process and that their cost and operational needs are met before any technologies are considered ready for deployment
5428233 at the end of the day if users cannot trust that technology works they will not take advantage of the many benefits we all know technology brings to the day to day activities of the homeland security workforce
5428234 i do want to commend all of you on some successes
5428235 we discussed last year the value of basic research to the homeland security mission i see that in this years budget request the basic research investment for the s amp t directorate will reach under secretary cohens goal of 20 percent a strong investment in basic research keeps dhs s amp t flexible and capable of responding to emerging threats quickly i want to reiterate that i am committed to working with dhs to ensure that r amp d investments are successful in increasing our knowledge of how to confront security challenges facing our nation
5428236 the obstacles we face in energy and sustainability are of unprecedented scale and complexity the senate and house are working on legislation to institute a cap and trade program for greenhouse gases we are still heavily dependent upon non renewable energy supplies that are located outside our borders we will only meet these challenges through aggressive and sustained support of research and development
5428237 i am pleased that this budget supports a restoration of funding for the u s contribution to the international fusion project iter as well as research towards a proposed international linear collider
5428238 it is important for us to honor our commitments and the credibility of the u s as a reliable partner in future large international research projects where much of science is heading will be significantly undermined if these corrective actions arent taken
5428239 the cheapest cleanest energy we will ever find is the energy we dont use therefore i cannot understand why the administration has once again elected to eliminate the weatherization assistance program we should be looking for more ways to encourage deployment of products and technologies that increase energy efficiency
5428240 these three bills deal with public safety improving the environment and border security addressing some of the nations most pressing issues
5428241 i strongly support each of these bills and look forward to working with my colleagues on the committee to advance this important legislation in the house
5428242 green transportation infrastructure is a simple and exciting set of technologies techniques and materials that can help solve substantial pollution problems in our communities while increasing energy efficiency and potentially decreasing total cost
5428243 the u s fire administration is an invaluable resource for the thousands of firefighters and emergency personnel around the country through training educational materials data collection and other services usfa provides tools and leadership to the fire service and the communities they serve
5428244 h r 4847 is the product of bipartisan collaboration and significant input from the fire service community and the committees support of this bill is a reflection of that communitys great service in cities and towns across the country
5428245 i believe this committee is ideally positioned to strengthen control of our nations borders through this legislation supporting effective efficient and evolving border defenses
5428246 the bill highlights three long term research areas unmanned aerial vehicles tunnel detection and anti counterfeit technologies that promise to significantly improve border security across all the threats we currently face
5428247 oil and gas will absolutely continue to play a vital role for the foreseeable future
5428248 we hope to have better alternatives soon but until then we should not be at all bashful in aggressively pursuing the cutting edge technologies that will unlock previously unrecoverable hydrocarbon reserves
5428249 we must embrace new technologies that can make our use of fossil fuels cleaner and more efficient
5428250 diversifying our energy supply by funding research and development and tapping into the science being conducted by nasa must be part of a national energy strategy

5428255 im personally quite happy that the countless pre smartphone or more accurately pre iphone phones have a decent browser available mini or mobile from opera
5428256 on javascript we are the fastest we are half the size of safari and less than half the size of ie in memory footprint
5428257 firefox 3 will be a desktop browser again this is about mobile browsers i think youll be in for a surprise
5428258 now iphone users may be browsing the web from their iphone a lot they have a data plan especially suited for that purpose after all but that doesnt mean that the iphone has sold more units than opera mini has users
5428259 when was operas dominance wiped out opera is still the most widely used mobile browser as far as i know the smartphone numbers for safari dont change that how can anyone claim that safari has more users than opera mini when the number of opera mini users is higher than the number of iphones sold that simply does not compute asa
5428260 operas most successful mobile product is getting soundly beat by just a few million brand new iphone users
5428261 but the point i was making and which you ignored is that opera mini users are also very active even though the vast majority likely has to pay quite a lot for the data they are downloading

5428263 in any case these machines are no longer running vista
5428264 the 35 is only an estimate but it shows a trend within our own user base
5428265 vistas installed base certainly doesnt equal the number of vista licenses that microsofts sold
5428266 one client is not doing vista at all but theyre refreshing their entire platform this year
5428267 everything ive seen clearly shows me that vista is an os that should never have left the barn

5428297 beijing should not be allowed to bask in the warm glow of peace and brotherhood associated with the opening games if china is still underwriting atrocities in darfur and still has not done what it should to bring peace and security to sudan

5428333 we used anthony and the johnsons last year and were using another song of theirs this year i got turned onto them through lou reed since lou reed is such a collaborator hes got his ear to the ground you know for new music
5428334 were using fistful of love thats a song of theirs that lou actually also sings on weve kind of shaped one of the episodes around that song it can be about grace but it can also be about a crime so the writers wrote this really fabulous script and we just finished shooting it
5428335 its a perfect marriage between a scene and a song
5428336 lou reed is and will continue to be my touchstone for this show
5428337 the path forward to our energy future is lined with new technologies that will diversify our energy supply with renewable sources and clean uses of fossil fuels such as coal this past year the science and technology committee focused on legislation to help develop the energy technologies we will need to address global climate change and reduce our dependence on foreign energy our committee cleared fourteen bipartisan energy and environment research bills a majority of which make up the core of the energy package passed today although this bill is a bit slimmer than the bill passed by the house last week it still represents a significant step forward the bill directs new investments in solar energy ocean and wave energy and new geothermal technologies that can be deployed in every part of the country it significantly expands research into biofuels so that we realize the potential of new fuels like cellulosic ethanol in addition this bill will help advance energy storage technologies that are critical to more widespread use of renewable electricity and advanced batteries for vehicles finally and importantly this bill provides significant increased investment in technologies to capture and store carbon dioxide from coal fired power plants helping to ensure that we can continue to use our countrys vast coal supply in cleaner and more efficient ways this bill alone may not solve our energy and climate challenges however it is a critical down payment on a cleaner and more independent energy future and i applaud its passage

5428342 in this era of technology and communication it is crucial that we provide the public with constant updates on committee activity
5428343 our site has grown to become a key tool for recording maintaining and distributing committee information one that i hope all those interested in our committee have come to rely on
5428344 the depth of information alone is exemplary with its consistent look and feel and features such as a site map and sorting capabilities for most of its documents the site goes above and beyond what is standard practice on capitol hill

5428347 is it possible or impossible to compare the experience of those who have suffered to those who have not suffered is it ever possible to warn anyone of oncoming danger how many witnesses have come to your country how many waves of immigration all warning you of the same experiences and the same dangers yet these proud skyscrapers still stand and you go on believing it will not happen here only when it happens to you will you know its true
5428348 but it is possible that the explanation is more sinister the epa ignored their own careful plans and abruptly closed libraries limited access to the public and epa employees and just threw away documents that may be irreplaceable the epas ability to protect the environment and public health is badly compromised as a result
5428349 a library is more than a collection of books and documents it is an organized body of knowledge that we continue to build upon as we expand our understanding of the world we live in if it is done right the creation of a web based virtual library would expand access to information to a much broader audience unfortunately the epa library network is nowhere near that goal
5428350 the agency appears to have avoided talking to any group with expertise or interest in their libraries epa made no attempt to reach out to the public and they virtually ignored congress until they reluctantly agreed to a moratorium on further implementation of their flawed plan
5428351 americans dont like the destruction of their books and libraries
5428352 congress has already told epa to reopen its regional libraries epa should reopen its headquarters and chemical libraries as well these are central assets that serve the washington d c staff of epa and the public and the loss of these libraries is a tragedy

5428400 during the last 50 years the world has witnessed truly revolutionary advances in science and technology we as a nation can take pride in knowing that american scientists researchers and entrepreneurs have been at the forefront of many of these advances
5428401 this committee can also take pride in knowing that it is directly responsible for many of the key federal policies that provided the foundation for u s technology leadership
5428402 sputnik showed us that we were not the worlds technological leader today with the rapid economic and technological advances of other countries i fear we are now on the cusp of another sputnik moment i fear that our country has coasted on the investments we made 50 years ago now is the time to act and i believe this committee has an important role to play in helping bring our country back as the technological leader in the world
5428403 this committee of course has been a leading advocate for expanding educational opportunities for american students and workers in the vital areas of science technology engineering and math stem these initiatives and many others this committee has spearheaded represent critical strides in the much needed effort to reform our faltering educational system and i commend you for your vision and efforts but in order to ensure the continued success of our young people now and in the future the public and private sectors must do more one of the most important steps that congress can take to address this issue is to fully fund the america competes act
5428404 bill gates embodies both the american spirit of innovation and the theological virtue of charity he has built arguably the most successful technology company in the world and then has turned his financial success into his gift to our society on this occasion of the 50th anniversary of this committee as we reflect back on the technological advances of the past and look ahead to the challenges facing our countrys competitiveness in the world i can think of no other witness better suited and well positioned to help share insights with this committee
5428405 the challenge every it organization has be it upgrading an operating system a database moving from single server to clustered or from non partitioned to partitioned is how do you rigorously test those changes you made
5428406 you dont have to ask hundreds or perhaps thousands of users to come off production systems for a few hours
5428407 it was all about giving our customers a set of tools to test those changes much quicker than they ever could have previously
5428408 the challenge every it organization has be it upgrading an operating system a database moving from single server to clustered or from non partitioned to partitioned is how do you rigorously test those changes you made

5428411 all our people to minister pastorally and sensitively to all irrespective of sexual orientation and to condemn irrational fear of homosexuals violence within marriage and any trivialisation and commercialisation of sex
5428412 the victimisation or diminishment of human beings whose affections happen to be ordered towards people of the same sex is anathema to us we assure homosexual people that they are children of god loved and valued by him and deserving of the best we can give of pastoral care and friendship
5428413 general exemption for a category of potential juror to be inquired of in the case here
5428414 see the allegation here this is a greek complainant and her nationality will be established on the evidence your honour its part of the narrative and there are allegations here of anal penetration and theres a common misunderstanding in the community that greeks like anal sex and she might readily then be seen to be compliant and in fact wanting it
5428415 that would be doing her a disservice it wouldnt be fair to either party
5428416 well theres a misconception in the community that greeks readily engage in anal sex
5428417 they the jurors should determine this case upon the evidence not on the misconceptions
5428418 well im not going to have a jury empanelled where no greek people can sit on the jury
5428419 well it may be theres only two or three on the panel your honour i cant
5428420 there will be but im not going to exclude someone simply because they are greek
5428421 my family came from chicago and wisconsin to come to my party for my 15
5428422 im excited that theyre here i invited them one year ago and they wanted to come and now im really happy that theyre here
5428423 ever since i was a young boy i dreamed of raising my children here
5428424 i think the majority of parents dream of that for their children of giving them the best of fulfilling our obligation as parents
5428425 like so many traditions we do things automatically and we dont fully understand the responsibilities along with it
5428426 its part of what we call popular religiosity mixing the religion with the culture doing it in the form of prayer doing it in the form of thanksgiving doing it in the form of ok we go out of here and we continue the celebration
5428427 we were like its too much stuff its too much money
5428428 shes the only sister i have the things i dont have right now i want to give it to her
5428429 so we just decided with one confirmed pregnancy and one were not sure about lets just take away any stress take away the show element of the day

5428431 what is any given blogger going to even cover from the floor that a national blogger wont be able to cover from in front of a tv set at home

5428438 so we are not a complete carmaker until we no longer have a backlog ed
5428439 if given to them a mid level 10 000 20 000 priced car that is basically a copy of the tesla only made cheaper and to go farther not faster will succeed if marketed right

5428441 one gets more money than anyone from drug companies the other one takes more money than anyone from washington lobbyists whats happened to the democratic party whatever happened to the party of the people

5428443 on a typical day more than half of u s english speaking hispanics 56 do something on their cell phone that might involve sending or receiving data
5428444 right now the temptation is to view the u s hispanic population as unlikely to be active online but thats misleading
5428445 providing cell phones to the 38 percent of americas 45 million poorest households now without them including millions of seniors hispanics african americans and rural residents could help them get work or make money worth 2 9 billion 11 billion

5428449 we are thrilled to see pinstripe receive this level of recognition
5428450 pinstripe has worked with us and together we have made significant advances in our talent acquisition process and results
5428451 thanks to our partnership with pinstripe we have moved forward in our recruiting initiatives
5428452 we have a more positive response from our hiring managers and new hires regarding their overall hiring experiences and less overall turnover which helps us to reduce overall labor costs we cant wait to see what we accomplish in the next year of our partnership
5428453 pinstripe was started by leading industry veterans so it is no surprise that they have come a long way in a short period of time
5428454 their accomplishment of rising from an emerging rpo provider to the bakers dozen in their first few years of existence is due to their high scores for both the breadth and the quality of their service offering these indices are weighted heavily in our customer survey and propelled pinstripe onto the list of leading rpo firms

5428461 it can do so because its a nanoparticle with a unique shape made from environmentally benign carbon and it can be made at a very reasonable cost
5428462 now that we know how to make this material and how to modify it so that it can be utilized in plastics
5428463 our attention is being directed to high end applications where we can really make some substantial changes in the way electronics fuel cells batteries and solar cells perform as a result of using this material

5428468 she is my sons mother william have you forgotten that gilbert will be king someday
5428469 william hold your tongue how can you say such a thing
5428470 how can you not like her she has such a wit about her and a wonderful sense of humor
5428471 sorry richard but i dont see it it seems as though you have taken quite an interest in her personality traits
5428472 yes i am interested in her she is a good person and i enjoy spending my afternoons talking with her there is nothing wrong with that is there
5428473 this has been two camps posturing and positioning so far doing everything from a distance away from the dividing line
5428474 now with this move ea has basically said were not going to go forward as outsiders you need to let us into the tent to see whats in the pipeline
5428475 i think its going to be months that were working our way through this period clearly months

5428492 the idea is that when you go to a charging station you pay 50 00 for a battery swap your depleated battery for a fully charged battery and the swap is done within a 10 minute time frame
5428493 that being said i believe your approach to using a single motor and transmission to drive an axle is not the best approach it is very costly and has way to sic many moving parts
5428494 tesla himself would have opted to use a smaller and more powerful variable speed dc motor on each wheel
5428495 so to move to say a 10 horsepower motor on each wheel would be cheap and the motor could replace the disk brakes and charge the batteries in the braking or slowing mode of the motors sic operation

5428519 what the republicans did to change the political landscape was to be opportunistic
5428520 us the real americans and real men against hippies and gays and blacks and northerners and libruls and no one can tell some of these guys that the un isnt gonna come in and try to take their guys and make their kids gay if the democrats get in
5428521 sure 10 percent of americans may think that barack obama is a muslim but as ben smith notes 22 percent believe bush knew about 9 11 in advance 30 percent believe saddam had weapons of mass destruction 23 percent believe theyve been in the presence of a ghost and 18 percent believe the sun revolves around the earth in other words its always going to be the case that a certain minority of the country believes wildly untrue and potentially even vicious things the question politically speaking is how big a minority where do they live and do they vote frankly my hunch is that barack obamas candidacy is more in danger from voters who believe him a black man than voters who believe him a muslim
5428522 oh the gop is just a party for rich folk
5428523 all because a bunch of nutjobs would rather have an extra 100 in their pocket at the end of the year than have a decent school for their children
5428524 do something really radical they went to work every day
5428525 one could just as easily cut taxes on the 0 100k bracket and have everyone reap the benefits of a tax break on that income that theyve received
5428526 i think we liberals screwed up with the acceptance of identity politics by minorities it was empowering for democrats and mimorities until white people figured out that they could play that game too
5428527 dee dee youre incorrectly assuming that all white people vote conservative
5428528 however beginning in 1968 i always voted republican because i found the democrats policies to range from merely foolish to positively revolting
5428529 because i found that my face was bruised by blows launched by my social and economic betters i decided to cut off my nose just to demonstrate my disgust
5428530 they named a brandy after napoleon they made a herring out of bismarck and the fuhrer is going to end up as a piece of cheese
5428531 the fact that youre all so willing to write off the white middle class which is what were really talking about here is incredibly elitist and self destructive
5428532 further it ignores two facts many of those reagan dems are gone while others have come back to and stayed with the democratic party
5428533 because i found that my face was bruised by blows launched by my social and economic betters i decided to cut off my nose just to demonstrate my disgust
5428534 oh thank god i didnt have to pay taxes to keep this bridge maintained
5428535 the appointment of judges who believe that the u s constitution as written means whatever the judges want it to mean in any given situation
5428536 who believe that the u s constitution as written means whatever the judges want it to mean in any given situation
5428537 undermining private property rights under the guise of concern for the environment
5428538 i know that many republicans are just as guilty of promoting these foolish and unjust policies
5428539 but the democrats have made these policies the center of their philosophy
5428540 compulsory union dues and fees typical republican wants to feed off of other peoples money while not spending a dime of their own if youre not willing to pay for union protections and union healthcare dont join a union otherwise youre being a leech and taking advantage of other people who are willing to pay for those protections
5428541 you want the financial benefits of being in a union without having to pay for those benefits
5428542 not wussing out on gay rights will cost us the elections
5428543 thats because if you work at that job you are receiving the benefits of it being unionized
5428544 would you approve of the national rifle association being able to compel all national rifle association members to pay dues because it claims to represent all of them and because the membership voted to require dues
5428545 would you approve of a union being able to compel all workers in an industry whether or not theyre actually represented by that union to pay dues because it claims to represent their rights whether or not they had any vote in the matter
5428546 the question of whether or not to unionize a shop is all or nothing for the workers in question
5428547 did you offer to give back all of your benefits
5428548 i simply disagree with the policies of the democrats surrender in vietnam
5428549 undermining private property rights under the guise of concern for the environment
5428550 we can do whatever the hell we want to anyone
5428551 im also still awaiting those positions where youre to the left of the republican platform three please
5428552 thats how democracy works personally i loathe george w bush but i still have to pay my taxes to finance his useless war thats what i get for living in a modern society if your workplace unionizes and you dont want to be a member of that union youre going to have to find a new job it sucks but its pretty funny to see the same group that tells people who dont like bush that they should leave the us whine when they have to find a new job because they didnt like the union election results
5428553 yes the constitution prevents the government from attacking your freedoms but it does not prevent your boss from attacking your freedoms your boss can tell you what reading material you are allowed to bring to work what color clothes you should wear who you are allowed to talk to and when what religious symbols you are allowed or not allowed to have on your person
5428554 in the future i expect the value of my annual gifts to trend higher in an irregular but eventually substantial manner
5428555 i had been in the high tech world for ten years and was increasingly dealing with attorneys and shareholders not dealing with customers and employees
5428556 a lot of it has to do with my family values i was always taught to give back to the community

5428572 this list does not represent every area where civilians face violence but focuses on the largest and worst situations where there are intentional targeted atrocities sometimes committed by governments
5428573 we hope this analysis will help remind political leaders of the worlds responsibility to protect civilians from atrocities occurring in states where the governments are unwilling or unable to do so
5428574 but i like shaun hes a terrific talent i wouldnt know how much chelsea wanted for him though if they were going to sell
5428575 maybe they would want to wait until a new manager comes in but equally they may not need a new manager to come in before they sell someone i wouldnt know how chelsea run their affairs
5428576 the player may want to wait until a new manager comes in and have a look at things then but maybe he would look at his situation there and think he wanted to leave
5428577 of course hes the type of player i would love to have though hes an excellent player
5428578 i think hes a top player but i think theres a couple of clubs in for him at the moment but i think weve got as good a chance as anyone now

5428585 we need to feel a sense of urgency and i hope your bosses who make the decisions about what projects go forward feel a sense of urgency
5428586 i assure you sir there is no one back there that i am interested in
5428587 well i suppose that it is a good for me then
5428588 see there i most definitely saw you look back again

5428590 youll be happy to know that imar jobes has paid your debt in full
5428591 how can i thank you enough sir you dont know how grateful i am i will pay you back you can be sure of that
5428592 dont worry michan just work some extra hours for me that it all i want you are a good man i wouldnt want something like this to change who you are
5428593 ryanne thank you for being his pledge today that was very courageous especially considering the circumstances
5428594 i am only sorry he was brought into my problems
5428595 well it was still a good thing i must leave now have a good day both of you
5428596 you deserved that michan i am sure if he hadnt done that someone else would have
5428597 i do not deserve such a gracious gift that was by far the nicest thing anyone has done for me
5428598 why in the world is she talking to lord oflatterys son
5428599 an enduring mystery in this whole subprime is why the servicers are so resistant to principal reduction as a strategy to minimize losses associated with foreclosures
5428600 it seems to me that reducing principal by say 20 to 25 and keeping a family in a home is highly preferable to bringing a property through the foreclosure process and facing loss severities that are now averaging 50 to 70 on the principal balance

5428658 delusional disorder is a psychiatric diagnosis denoting a psychotic mental illness that involves holding one or more non bizarre delusions in the absence of any other significant psychopathology signs or symptoms of mental illness indicators of a delusion 1 the patient expresses an idea or belief with unusual persistence or force 2 that idea appears to exert an undue influence on his or her life and the way of life is often altered to an inexplicable extent 3 despite his her profound conviction there is often a quality of secretiveness or suspicion when the patient is questioned about it 4 the individual tends to be humorless and oversensitive especially about the belief 5 there is a quality of centrality no matter how unlikely it is that these strange things are happening to him the patient accepts them relatively unquestioningly 6 an attempt to contradict the belief is likely to arouse an inappropriately strong emotional reaction often with irritability and hostility 7 the belief is at the least unlikely 8 the patient is emotionally over invested in the idea and it overwhelms other elements of his psyche 9 the delusion if acted out often leads to behaviors which are abnormal and or out of character although perhaps understandable in the light of the delusional beliefs 10 individuals who know the patient will observe that his belief and behavior are uncharacteristic and alien

5428660 the ship was rushing through space at twice the speed of imagination
5428661 actions such as this make it clear that congress needs to pass and enforce a scientific integrity act to protect the rights of government scientists and researchers if the experts arent free to talk about their work without threat of editing or interference then the public is one who suffers
5428662 in the past we have received promises from dr marburger and the administration that they will protect the rights of scientists and science particularly in the area of climate change but recent actions show we may not be able to rely on those promises rep henry waxman and i introduced a scientific integrity act in the last congress and i intend to introduce it again
5428663 when congress calls a witness to testify we expect the witness to testify based on the truth as the witness knows it not what a higher up tells the witness is true my advice to any administration witness is if youre convicted of contempt of congress obstruction of justice or perjury dr marburger will not serve your sentence for you
5428664 i used comic life on my mac exclusively to lay out the storyboards then later when i created and colored all 24 pages of the issue
5428665 being an illustrator it saved me quite a bit of time from having to lay all the text bubbles out manually it made the process of actually creating the comic that much more enjoyable

5428690 the president tonight renewed his call for an economic recovery plan
5428691 we have people on both sides of the fence some are saying its trying to promote the devil other people are defending the arts to the hilt
5428692 documents obtained recently by the committee make us question whether you used best science or provided trusted health information to some of the nations most vulnerable citizens or just provided the evaluation that fema preferred
5428693 the evidence that fema ignored hid and manipulated government research on the potential impact of long term exposure to formaldehyde on katrina victims now living in travel trailers is hard to ignore
5428694 honest scientific studies dont start with the conclusion and then work backwards from there
5428695 have to be in a trailer you can pay for an apartment on your own
5428696 maintaining a high standard for scientific integrity in the u s and in the government is key to u s economic growth and security period any time i suspect that scientific analysis and findings are being censored to further a political agenda that gets my attention and concern
5428697 our committee has been looking closely at atsdr for some time and we believe the report on formaldehyde in fema trailers may be just the tip of the iceberg as chairman i assure you this will continue garnering the committees attention for some time to come

5428710 iranian internet users and bloggers already have to cope with very aggressive filtering policies the passage of such a law based on ill defined concepts and giving judges a lot of room for interpretation would have disastrous consequences for online freedom we urge the parliaments members to oppose this bill and instead to starting working on a moratorium on the death penalty

5428717 telecom promoters like me mittal do their best to undermine the pension rights of tens of thousands of staff
5428718 the economic situation of hutchs employees will become precarious after the buyout
5428719 telecom promoters like me mittal indulge in cynical exploitation there is a two tier force in telecom hutchs employees are paid a second class rate for doing a top class job telecom promoters are a group of greedy employers who want to deprive badly paid workers of a proper five figure salary i like to publicly insult my employees like this
5428720 were able to actually break them down into smaller pieces and manage them separately
5428721 this allows us to start versioning or updating certain pieces of our infrastructure without needing everything to move with it
5428722 in an ideal world we would be able to build all our applications from scratch being completely in control of all the different architectures and how they work together but in the real world thats not how it works even if we get the opportunity to start building a piece of it from scratch we still have to integrate with applications that already exist and we end up writing a bunch of glue code to kind of piece the process and data together
5428723 this makes for a very brittle environment and its something thats very hard to manage
5428724 you decouple interface from implementation and that allows you to not worry about the details of back end implementation
5428725 only very large changes every year 18 months or two years
5428726 erica did your undecided voters in the room say who they felt won
5428727 they did the interesting thing is they thought that senator edwards won the debate
5428728 what didnt pay off were attacks that may have played well in the debate hall but it left our voters cold and left an opening for john edwards to grab his best reaction
5428729 this kind of squabbling how many children is this going to get health care how many people are going to get an education from this
5428730 i thought it was a particularly strong night for john edwards who seemed to walk the fence and try and calm down the bickering at the same time calling attention to the issues
5428731 i have to say im not one i dont want to handicap this thing and call a winner or a loser but you have to echo what john edwards said arent there three people in this debate i thought it was a particularly strong night for john edwards who seemed to walk the fence and try and calm down the bickering at the same time calling attention to the issues how do you think he did last night
5428732 well john edwards was able to be the odd man out and look reasonable and much more focused on issues than personal positions
5428733 i thought the winner was john edwards this actually ended up being john edwards night
5428734 and like many of the guests youve had on previously i thought the winner was john edwards i thought he really helped himself tonight where he could come in above the fray refocus the debate on the issues this actually ended up being john edwards night
5428735 i believe that actually tonight was john edwards best performance and actually he came out better than he has in any other debate
5428736 and i believe that actually tonight was john edwards best performance but edwards clearly came out very well tonight he certainly helped himself and i believe now even if he comes in third as a result of his performance tonight can keep going to the convention where he may still have a role to play
5428737 was the one who was on message who kept bringing them back and saying what does this have to do with childrens health care
5428738 probably john edwards simply because he stayed out of it i talked to people who were in the room during the debate and i said well what did you think and they said well i thought it was too much arguing so if you buy into the old political saw that when a and b argue c is the beneficiary john edwards was the one who was on message who kept bringing them back and saying what does this have to do with childrens health care that bite that you played so if i had to guess it would be him
5428739 this was the rowdiest debate by far in the democratic contest and while each of the candidates had fine moments id score this one for john edwards especially in the standing portion of this two hour rumble tonight he was the catalyst for the action
5428740 heres some quick post debate thoughts john edwards got himself back in it
5428741 edwards effectively pointed to the heated squabbling between the two frontrunners as a deviation from the issues that matter in short order edwards had gotten the best of both his opponents
5428742 john edwards effectively pointed to the heated squabbling between the two frontrunners in anticipation of saturdays south carolina democratic primary as a deviation from the issues that matter in short order edwards had gotten the best of both his opponents that was the order of the night again and again edwards took the side of one of the frontrunners against the other effectively serving as an arbiter between the two it was an ideal position for edwards the outsider candidate who is struggling to distinguish himself from two opponents with more money and better poll positions
5428743 whether he would make the same sort of argument about social security
5428744 clinton and edwards would require everybody to obtain health insurance and obama wouldnt clinton and edwards framed the argument perfectly it was edwards though who had the best argument of all
5428745 from the day this campaign began hes driven the policy agenda
5428746 right now john edwards is talking about poverty and that alone is reason to be thankful hes on the stage even now from the day this campaign began hes driven the policy agenda not just by embracing ambitious policy initiatives but also by focussing everybodys attention on people who frankly dont get enough explicit attention in politics
5428747 likely won favor with viewers by repeatedly trying to take the high road and stay above obamas and clintons demolition derby
5428748 edwards said to applause how many people are going to get an education from this
5428749 the biggest benefactor of the fight might be former north carolina sen
5428750 8 58 pm edwards comparison of choice in health care to choice is social security is a pretty good analogy
5428751 made the best of the situation on a level playing field edwards would have won the debate by a wide margin

5428758 in my view this quarter underscores our ability to deliver strong results even in an arguably more difficult market environment
5428759 in fact if we were a company reporting in us dollars second quarter growth would have been even higher we once again achieved significant share gains in the core enterprise application software market
5428760 at the end of the second quarter our share based on a 38 1 billion market was 33 7 representing an increase of 1 1 percentage point compared to the first quarter of 2008 and an increase of 7 7 percentage points compared to the second quarter of 2007 of which 4 5 percentage points represented organic growth these are very strong share gains and demonstrate our undisputed leadership in business applications for every one dollar of application product revenue added by our closest competitor last year we added around 2 of product revenue
5428761 the market remains value driven as it has been for quite some time meaning that customers demand a proven business case as part of their buying decision
5428762 in our largest region emea the environment has not really changed compared to the first quarter customer sentiment is cautious but resolute with demand for sap products at the same sound level compared to previous quarters in the us customer sentiment was better than what we saw in q1 deal slippage was not an issue for q2 and we hope to keep it that way for the rest of the year
5428763 in automotive we signed a global enterprise agreement with daimler ag in the second quarter
5428764 sap has been daimlers software partner since 1984 and became daimlers top strategic software partner by entering a software development partnership in 2002
5428765 in all our planning in the near future we were extremely conservative with regards to bydesign i think it was right decision at the end of the first quarter to say quality and in particular profitability for sap is priority number one
5428766 on the banking side the commonwealth bank group will undertake a comprehensive programme to modernise its existing banking legacy systems with sap for banking solutions another customer commerzbank germanys second largest bank has successfully implemented the sap for banking solution portfolio in just nine months the system will process 1 2 million loans yearly also bank of ireland has selected business objects as its business intelligence standard following an extensive review of available business intelligence solutions
5428767 for sap business bydesign we have continued to work on a product based on the feedback we have received from our customers
5428768 we are continuing to execute on our adjusted go to market approach our priority is ensuring that we deliver a top quality product with high profitability by optimising the end to end process of delivering selling and supporting the solution
5428769 in all our planning in the near future we were extremely conservative with regards to bydesign i think it was right decision at the end of the first quarter to say quality and in particular profitability for sap is priority number one bydesign is in its approach unique we have time enough for that we will shift our focus we are now in the phase of preparing the next release in response to key indicators which is not primarily the number of customers or whatever its much more how can we improve factors like tco and others so that we really achieve these goals of extreme high quality and high profitability for sap
5428770 gilbert it is so good to finally meet you i have always thought about you
5428771 i am fine sir how are you youre injury i mean
5428772 i am better for a while there they werent sure what was going to happen which was a blessing in a way because you are here now because of it i am having trouble walking but when i was told you were here i knew i had to come even if they had to carry me
5428773 how do you feel about being here they didnt really give you a choice in the matter
5428774 i did you need to know how to read in this world and i wanted to make sure it was something you would always have
5428775 i want you to know that i was young when everything happened with your mother i had a father who was quite stubborn he required everything to be just as it should be according to him he wanted me to marry someone of his choosing preferably someone from a noble family like ours i never married back then for reasons i am not so sure of that isnt to say that i am blameless i was too young to realize what i should have done then as the years went on i guess i couldnt face it i am sorry gilbert i tried to make things easier for you and your mother but i dont think it was hardly enough
5428776 now that you are better does that mean we will be going back to our village now that i am not really needed
5428777 that is up to you and your mother if you dont want to be here then i cannot make you stay however i want you to know that i would like you to be here ever since my brother told me that you had arrived i have been feeling very happy and i havent been happy in a long time
5428778 to be honest i have only been the king for a short while and the last year or so hasnt been so wonderful for reasons ill tell you about some other time
5428779 so should we go meet your mother i havent seen her in many years i am anxious to see her again
5428780 i believe she is in the next chamber ill get her so that you dont have to move your leg too much
5428781 thank you your highness for your hospitality we are happy to be here
5428782 i am disturbed by how little attention the topic of economic justice has received during this campaign
5428783 i want to challenge all candidates to follow your lead and speak up loudly and forcefully on the issue of economic justice in america
5428784 from our conversation yesterday i know this is personal for you
5428785 i believe that now more than ever we need a leader who wakes up every morning with the knowledge of that injustice in the forefront of their minds and who knows that when we commit ourselves to a cause as a nation we can make major strides in our own lifetimes
5428786 nothing is certain in life but death and taxes which bodes well for the nations largest tax preparation company h amp r block which delivered a record setting tax season
5428787 russ has excellent experience working with a powerful brand and delivering consistently high quality performance across a vast retail network
5428788 russ will help h amp r block utilize more effectively the power of its brand in growing market share and also in improving efficiency and developing new distribution channels in the united states and internationally
5428789 the first session of the 110th congress was one of the most productive and bipartisan in our history in that time the science and technology committee helped enact two major pieces of legislation a bill to keep our country competitive and improve math and science education hr 2272 the america competes act and a bill to reduce our dependence on foreign sources of energy through expanded energy technology development hr 6 the energy independence and security act of 2007
5428790 im glad that in his state of the union speech tonight the president says we need to make sure our children graduate prepared for the jobs of the 21st century by strengthening math and science education however the presidents american competitiveness initiative aci has never included a specific science education component and his budget last year proposed cutting funding for k 12 education activities at the national science foundation this year the presidents fy2009 budget needs to better reflect the priorities of the america competes act which he signed into law last year
5428791 in addition the president says that he is dedicated to strong growth in renewable electricity generation and clean and efficient technologies critical to reducing greenhouse gas emissions including those in hr 6 we need to see these priorities reflected in his budget which last year proposed major cuts to energy efficiency and renewables
5428792 finally the president stressed the role of technology in enhancing the capabilities of our border patrol agents however many existing technologies are not ready for full deployment along the border because of high costs and lack of technical or workforce training this year my committee will move legislation on new research programs that provide critical support to several presidential homeland security initiatives including the use of unmanned aerial systems along the southern border in turn the president needs to support these efforts by advocating for a stronger investment in homeland security r amp d
5428793 this year the committee will celebrate its 50th anniversary just as this committee responded to the challenges presented by the space age back in 1958 this year we will continue working to address the emerging challenges facing our nation we must embrace the american spirit of innovation if we are to protect u s global competitiveness invest in math and science education advance the development of energy technologies address the threats of climate change embrace the opportunities presented by nanotechnology better protect our homeland and ensure the continued success of all of nasas missions each of these areas will take center stage on our agenda

5428798 there are a hundred logical reasons why i should love this person
5428799 i think it is foolish to not assign some sort of meaning to these events
5428800 it could very well be that once a person decides they have no free will they in fact dont but they did have it and used it to destroy it how interesting
5428801 we have a duty to protect innocent families not only from the criminals who make and use this illegal drug but also from the after effects of that crime
5428802 i have pushed this effort for a long time and it is gratifying that it will soon become law
5428803 meth production and use is rampant in my home state of tennessee and in other states across the country im glad my colleagues in the house and senate have joined with me in working to assist local communities in clearing it out and cleaning it up

5428805 a 20 times slower vacuum tool for silicon pv cells would cost about 10 times as much
5428806 we want to produce the smart still in the current generation as a battery powered vehicle with lithium ion technology
5428807 i believe that martin requested his vehicle be repaired iirc
5428808 my quick internet research shows that 3 square feet of photovoltaic cells produces up to 300 watts of power clearly more than is typically being continuously consumed at constant speed
5428809 john warner cited studies that showed the 55 mph speed limit saved 167 000 barrels of oil a day or 2 percent of the countrys highway fuel consumption while avoiding up to 4 000 traffic deaths a year
5428810 the cost of living in the valley is about twice what it is in albuquerque a tricked out toyota corolla runs in the low 20k range
5428811 oh boy we get to be the agents of the mammoth corporations that will crush the poor indian brothers who stumbled into developing the version of scrabble that everybody actually loves
5428812 mark blecher general manager for digital media and gaming at hasbro said his company has been working with ea to make the look and feel consistent across platforms giving the authorized version what he called an advantage over scrabulous

5428817 the ehop program will allow a larger base of city and msu employees to experience the high quality of life east lansing has to offer while simultaneously encouraging retention of the east lansing work force and reinvestment in east lansings older historic neighborhoods
5428818 michigan state university is pleased to partner with the city of east lansing on programs like ehop that encourage employees of the city and the university to purchase homes and live in our shared community east lansing is a wonderful home for msu our students and employees collaborating on initiatives such as this help to build a stronger more unified and inclusive community in which to live and work

5428821 seemed like we had a whole new congregation every two years
5428822 perhaps the new mexico factory should build roadsters for a while with this kind of demand
5428823 is this a practical car if it doesnt even have a working transmission
5428824 tesla has operational problems that need to be solved and if the board thought there was any way that martin could be part of the solution then he would still be an employee of the company
5428825 there comes a time in the life of every development program that you have to shoot the engineers and start production

5428829 i believe i have gotten to the root of our global energy crisis
5428830 when its way too late to do anything about it
5428831 more and more americans want to get involved in our campaign because they recognize that john edwards is the only candidate in this race with the backbone to say we are in a fight for the middle class and we cant negotiate or take money from powerful entrenched interests if we are going to have change we have to take them on our campaign relies on the support of regular americans and with their support we can bring real change to america
5428832 book to the future book marketing amp social networking trends
5428833 nothing came at all i just got stuck on these two chords and a phrase
5428834 im proud of the science and technology committees contribution to this energy package over the past year we have worked hard to clear fourteen bipartisan consensus driven energy and environment research bills through committee nine of our bills are included in the house package passed today this package represents the hard work of many of our committee members including reps giffords mcnerney matheson udall hooley and lipinski
5428835 for too long we have depended on a handful of finite energy resources to power our economy our future lies in our ability to develop a wide range of energy technologies that use clean natural resources from the sun the ocean and the earth boost the energy efficiency of our vehicles buildings and heavy industries and capture and store carbon dioxide from coal fired power plants
5428836 the nations of the world have begun in bali this week to define the steps needed to address the challenge of climate change this energy package includes the r amp d into new technologies that will help ensure our country can reduce co2 emissions and become more energy independent
5428837 1 000 000 from the new nine inch nails album
5428838 thanks to the effort thanks to the letters thanks to the urgent actions today we can smile and we can be alive because they drew attention to our situation
5428839 you are the next because you the heat sic head
5428840 in our current struggle with terrorism we shouldnt just dismiss evil as the product of insanity or fanaticism understanding evil is the first step in countering it
5428841 the removal of mandatory formalities registration notice and renewal and extension of copyright terms only burdens use it does not benefit rights holders
5428842 thats not the filter of renewal thats renewal by fiat the terms of those works was then extended again in 1998 in the copyright term extension act that extension was different than any extension in the past because it happened without the renewal filter having separated the valuable copyrights from those that have stopped delivering returns to a creator
5428843 the question for the million book project is what we are allowed to make available under u s law before 1964 its not very hard to figure out which books are under copyright because theres a registration system
5428844 but then there are all the rest in this limbo period the so called orphan works i cant tell you how many books are caught under this but its a huge number theyre not in print not available commercially but under copyright i would conservatively estimate that more than 50 percent of the books from this period are in this state
5428845 unfortunately these works are not few there are millions of them
5428846 we would like it clarified that we can make out of print works available on the internet otherwise we live in a world of just very old works in the public domain and commercially available works everything in between effectively will be denied the next generation we could lose the 20th century
5428847 we broke new ground by being able to put a great deal of our moving image heritage online with the internet archive its just a drop in the bucket but people have been given a huge amount of access
5428848 probably between 1 5 and 2 million individual films have been downloaded and are out in the world now people teach with them people link out of syllabi to them but the orphan films that are caught in this limbo we cant do anything with them they are probably abandoned they probably dont have any willing parent who wants to take care of them but we cannot assume the risk of doing preservation work or conservation work or preservation copying of any of those films and putting them online
5428849 this is a period when people starting making color film that fades to pink if you act fast enough you can stabilize that and make copies that are decent color right now we cant all of the post 1963 material we have on the archive with a very few exceptions is government material there are literally hundreds of thousands of abandoned films from that period that we and others could make available
5428850 we now have a system that allows us to distribute creative work inexpensively and ubiquitously so why not use it we really feel strongly that there could be a great cultural efflorescence cultural and group identities of different generations would begin to make it out there on the net the books that are on the net right now are very very old and there isnt anything for younger people to point to and say thats my life thats my culture
5428851 think back to eldred for a moment there was something the supreme court said in
5428852 i would make the following observation whenever congress has extended copyright before it only extended terms for works that have passed through the filter of renewal for works that are renewed it sends a signal that these works have enduring copyright value if theres ever a time when extending terms of existing works makes sense it would be for works that have successfully passed through the renewal filter the term extension in the ctea extended terms for works that had never passed through the filter of renewal that was the first time that happened
5428853 congress right to grant exclusive rights is premised on we say a requirement that it promote progress in whatever system it enacts of copyright and patent
5428854 copyright is a property rights regime just like any other property rights regime for 186 years the rule was that if you wanted a property right for your intellectual creation you had to hold up your hand and say i want this and register to get it flip that regime to one where property automatically vests in you the minute you lift your pen from the cocktail napkin thats a very very meaningful shift in the character of the copyright laws and its a shift that hasnt benefited anyone systematically and that has caused harm real harm and does not on balance promote progress
5428855 does absolutely nothing to track down who owns the title to a piece of property land ownership records are carefully maintained by the state and when an owner dies ownership is legally transferred to someone else thats why its quite reasonable for the law to forbid me from using someone elses property without permission this is not the case with copyright the government owns few and often out of date records and yet acts as if the ownership were easily and unambiguously available
5428856 pending in congress is the public domain enhancement act which would at the end of a life plus 50 term impose a small renewal fee in order to provide a filter thereby winnowing out some valuable copyrights and letting the rest move more quickly into the public domain theres a change that could be quickly implemented that would help another change would be at the international level we are signatories to the berne convention which prohibits formalities perhaps we could propose to make some changes to the berne convention which would allow us to reformalize our domestic copyright system
5428857 we could reformalize purely at the domestic level if we do it correctly
5428858 its true that the court was reluctant in the context of eldred to get into 76 but that context was interesting in that eldred was looking narrowly at term extensions and i think that what the court was responding to was the uncomfortable truth about 76 the 1976 act changed the direction of u s copyright law it really represents a break with the historical norms to a certain extent were going to have to look at the 76 act and were going to have to think hard about whether systemic change is necessary were hoping in this case not only to win our constitutional claims but also to get people thinking about our copyright system in the last quarter century and to consider whether this system is a good system for the digital age

5428889 in a letter dated june 1 2007 exxonmobil assured the subcommittee that they use their funding of science on the environment to produce sound science its hard to see this article as rigorous sound science the article has all the trappings of being peer reviewed analysis based on independent research when it is little more than an editorial that received no peer review exxonmobil assured the subcommittee that they want to inform public debate through their funding of science the purpose of the article appears to be to provide a fa ade of scientific respectability to those who say the polar bear is just fine but theres nothing behind the fa ade those who oppose listing the polar bear as a threatened species under the endangered species act are now citing the soon essay to justify their opposition
5428890 the subcommittee wants to understand how exxonmobil decided to fund an astrophysicist to do research on polar bears
5428891 we have asked for their files on funding for dr soon in this area as well as funding of any other researchers working on arctic animal species the public deserves to know if exxonmobil is funding other scientists who work on animal species in this region who are less open than dr soon about the source of those funds

5428901 there is a general consensus that the result of fully utilized information technology would be lower cost and improved patient care regardless of its acknowledged benefits the use of it by the healthcare community remains low and lags far behind other segments of our economy such as financial services banking and manufacturing
5428902 in a world of electronic information these issues can only be resolved through the development of technical standards these standards currently do not exist in any comprehensive form

5428904 the mine collapse at crandall canyon mine in utah destroyed any means of tracking or communicating with the trapped miners it was an excruciating ordeal for the families the mine owner and the mine rescuers deep underground mines pose unique technological challenges for existing tracking and communications systems we need to jump start the research development and demonstration of new technology that will give mine workers and the industry a safer working environment

5428921 our economic and environmental security lies in our ability to deploy the next generation energy technologies advances in energy storage are vital to diversifying our energy supplies and transforming our transportation sector
5428922 while the u s industrial sector has become much more energy efficient over the past 30 years there are still ample opportunities to achieve efficiency gains through advanced technologies
5428923 without a sustained commitment by the private and public sectors to invest in r amp d the ability to close the gap between u s energy supply and demand will be greatly limited this legislation is needed to ensure continued gains in industrial energy efficiency and environmental performance through research and development

5428925 the mandatory nature of this change along with the increase in cost has received hugely negative feedback from our membership
5428926 with sap enterprise support customers are provided an unrivalled comprehensive support offering at a cost that is below the average of maintenance fees found elsewhere
5428927 in the six months since its release the offering has experienced positive market adoption with more than 350 new customers signed on
5428928 there still is an enormous potential for efficiency increases and cost reductions when it comes to the management of entire application landscapes
5428929 we started to roll out the set of tools that greatly facilitates the management of not only the sap landscapes but multi vendor landscapes including a growing number of composite applications and processes that link several companies and constantly adapting and transforming business networks so in a sense enterprise support and supervision of the corresponding technologies and services represents the logical transfer of our business process platform strategy to our support operations we are convinced that enterprise support will ultimately lead to a net decrease of the total cost of ownership for the overwhelming majority of our customer base
5428930 the mandatory nature of this change along with the increase in cost has received hugely negative feedback from our membership to date
5428931 the enterprise support product includes additional support activities not currently included in the standard support product and based on case studies appears to offer great value potential but is yet to be fully proven included in the announcement however is an indication that pricing will increase from 17 of contract value to 22 of contract value immediately applicable to new customers and introduced in a phased way for existing customers
5428932 in real terms this is a 29 4 increase in costs over the next four years for existing sap customers and is proving to be a particularly difficult area to accept the enterprise support product looks good and for organisations needing the extra level of support that it offers it will no doubt provide value however many of our members may not want or need this extra level of support and therefore are reacting negatively to having a new support product and the associated increase in costs forced upon them in addition along with the german speaking user group we are sceptical that the enterprise support offering is sized appropriately and we remain concerned on its suitability for many small and medium sized enterprises
5428933 i would encourage all organisations impacted by these changes to examine the potential value of the offering and to contact sap to provide their feedback on this price increase
5428934 i would also encourage sap to reconsider this mandatory price rise so that organisations not requiring the extra level of support provided in enterprise support do not have to pay for features they do not require
5428935 i wonder whether saps move will encourage other perpetual license vendors to move to 22 my suspicion is yes
5428936 cios looking at the hike in support costs can and should object strenuously to this mandate since it serves no one well except the vendor
5428937 fortunately perhaps while there is only one sap paying customers have other choices when it comes to purchasing support despite the current skills shortage which sap is exploiting rather than addressing disgruntled customers can shop around for cheaper and more reasonable terms and conditions
5428938 customers are right to question the value theyll get from the new price hike
5428939 ive heard many large manufacturers complain that a large part of the current sap development budget is going for new verticals e g service industries or products e g sap business bydesign for small companies not relevant to them sap competitors may love reading the blog posts from customers unhappy with the news my bet is this will blow over i wonder though whether saps move will encourage other perpetual licence vendors to move to 22 my suspicion is yes
5428940 a conspiracy to engage in and cover up corporate theft of oracle intellectual property on the grandest scale
5428941 conspired to leverage the stolen oracle intellectual property to entice customers to migrate to sap software applications through saps safe passage program
5428942 all the measures i and the board have taken were correct
5428943 we are going to defend our brand and our good name in the courts
5428944 gartners discussions with customers that have made the transition from tomorrownow to rimini street indicate that the process is straightforward and can be accomplished in as little as a few weeks which is significantly faster than migrating to supported versions of oracle products
5428945 at a time when purse strings are being pulled tight saps announcement that it is raising licence and support costs is not only bad news for software buyers but the software industry as a whole
5428946 over the years as service levels increase and upgrades take place pricing changes are inevitable however many businesses are already suspicious of software vendors and what they perceive as being rigid and complex licensing models confusion breeds the suspicion that they are not always getting value for money and all too often this suspicion is borne out as customers pay for unused licences when organisations are investing significant amounts on software licences every year concern over the return on money spent is understandable
5428947 the only solution is for the software industry to get back to basics customers need to see a clear commitment to flexible and transparent licensing this needs to be one in which customers can continue to be confident that they are only paying for what they use
5428948 although the astronauts and family members interviewed do not represent a random or exhaustive sample of the larger population the issues they raised during these unstructured interviews were remarkably consistent and compelling and deserve focused action
5428949 major vulnerabilities underlying root causes and contributing factors extend well beyond the specific medical aspects of nasa operations many of the cultural and structural issues identified in the report have existed for many years pre dating the current leadership team are deeply ingrained and will take senior leadership action to remediate them
5428950 the findings of nasas anonymous survey echo a number of the concerns originally raised last summer by col bachmanns external astronaut health care assessment panel nasa now needs to demonstrate its sustained and serious commitment to addressing those concerns and the committee will work to see that they do so
5428951 the hearing i called last fall to examine nasas astronaut health care system raised a number of serious issues that nasa needed to address while the anonymous survey released today provides some useful data nasas action plan for addressing the problems identified last year is still unavailable nasa needs to provide that plan expeditiously if congress is to be confident that nasa is serious about dealing with concerns raised by col bachmann and others and i intend to press nasa to do so

5428954 as ive said time and again we have to recognize there are roughly seven billion people in the world half of whom make less than 2 a day we cannot and would not want to compete with that
5428955 we have to compete at a higher level with a better equipped and skilled workforce than that of our global counterparts and we do that by focusing on science education and innovation
5428956 im confident that the same enthusiasm and coordinated effort that led to the passage of the america competes act last year will bring this debate to fruition
5428957 as chairman of the house science and technology committee and the father of a 6 year old daughter i understand we cannot allow our children to become the first american generation to inherit a lower standard of living than their parents ensuring our kids have the best education and jobs available to them is a challenge all of us must undertake
5428958 the competes legislation was a great step forward for u s efforts in science technology innovation and education and it will yield results but the debate on science and technology in this country must grow to be part of a national discussion on our future and a presidential debate on the subject would put it front and center

5428985 we need a president of the united states who actually understands youre life its one thing to fly into south carolina from someplace else give a speech go to a debate and then fly back out it is a very different thing to have lived here to have grown up in this part of the country and to understand in a personal way whats happening in you lives
5428986 and the reason it matters is because if you have a president who understands your way of life and who cares about where you life the odds go up tremendously that theyre actually going to fight for you
5428987 weve seen whats happening here in south carolina with the unemployment rate going up 6 000 jobs lost last month and then john mccain said just a few days ago that the economy actually is doing fine that were not headed into a recession the fundamentals were strong and remain strong

5429244 stuff to the web and linking and searching and browsing and stumbling over material that might
5429245 tacit instituational knowledge and my informal surveys over the last year have shown little practical growth here
5429246 aoife i am sorry i dont know what happened i couldnt stop myself
5429247 dont worry richard there isnt anything we can do about what happened you need to heal your leg lets not even bring it up again

5429255 hes right maybe you should go back to the cottage i have to get back inside
5429256 richard what are you doing lying around you should have gone hunting with us we had a very good day
5429257 why are you avoiding the obvious i am that bad off arent i
5429258 i didnt plan it i just found myself there i was getting the annulment writ and i was angry
5429259 you know as well as i that this is not looking very good the doctor has sent for the priest i know what that means
5429260 you are finally king you mustnt give up on yourself now
5429261 we have come a long way and we have done everything we said we were going to do get better so we can finally live it
5429262 i understand everything you just said but i need to be realistic if it happens i need you to bring him here
5429263 lees cited idc data indicating that windows mobile unit sales have grown faster than the overall market expanding from slightly more than 11 percent to just under 13 percent of the worldwide market for
5429264 smartphones are still seeing growth rates hovering around 40 0 year over year while the rest of the industry is growing at roughly 10 0
5429265 however grouping the rest of the handsets into one category is doing the industry no justice the rise of the feature phone has created a battle at the high end of the market with the main difference between smartphone and feature phone being the high level operating system we expect the competition at the high end will help drive growth within the market and help move volume to higher end devices
5429266 i realized that cars really are the fulcrum of the economy
5429267 if you can change cars you can change many things it is the end of business as usual and the car industry needs to figure out ways to build cars that are not using fossil fuels
5429268 he wants plug ins for the same reason gm wants them to get away from the use of petroleum and because they offer an environmental solution
5429269 theyre not convinced or they are still in a business as usual mode
5429270 they dont understand that the world around them is changing and these things are going to have to happen
5429271 it wasnt until felix came along that they got some traction because hes a promoter
5429272 if you want to find out the daily kos or the most prominent source of public info about plug in hybrid electric vehicles its calcars
5429273 if a conventional car uses 700 gallons of gas per year you could reduce that to 70 gallons per year in a plug in electric hybrid vehicle
5429274 no i dont know why i liked the jetsons so much
5429275 we havent finalized plans for europe although we are certainly eager to grow our business there once we have established our business in the us and can confidently expand production and distribution ed
5429276 the big issue at this point is cash flow and margins
5429277 most major handset manufacturers suffering this big of a decline start burning up cash
5429278 even in a tough competitive market there are things you can control
5429279 the streets understanding is that motorola has worked through its a candidate list and is into its b list
5429280 she has been gone for a few hours she didnt want to disturb you do you want the message your highness it is marked urgent
5429281 she made her orders clear we had no choice but to let her go
5429282 have my horse ready in fifteen minutes leave me and send for my brother
5429283 well it could be worse he is allowing you to continue to rule leinster
5429284 i dont know we finally had an astounding night together i thought it would bring us closer but when i woke up she was gone
5429285 well she cannot leave you if that is what you are worried about she is bound to you by marriage
5429286 calm down richard we will find this man and take care of things i will fetch my horse and we will go immediately any idea where he may be
5429287 i think i may know he could either be at lord oflatterys manor or the cottage he was given to live in with aoife upon their marriage
5429288 i will meet you at the stables and we shall find this man before aoife does
5429289 we run a large and messy application on php 4
5429290 jan would an easy way to run php lint checking of your codebase against php 5 help
5429291 well dan this is all well and good but this only benefits facebook
5429292 hey driver can we get an autograph for the kid over here
5429293 number 999 but allow me to put the debate to rest right now figure eight schoolbus racing is the highest form of motorsport in existence
5429294 then a guy walked by and decided that i was gay he came up and punched me so hard that he knocked out a tooth others were shocked but they didnt react because they just thought that the attacker had drunk too much i did not report the incident to the police because it is my experience that the police in particular have a nasty and humiliating attitude towards gays
5429295 i was approaching to an entrance when i saw young people smoking nearby
5429296 i didnt call to police because im not sure that they would take my side when find that im gay
5429297 the owner of the bar together with his son decided to beat us up they locked the door and we couldnt escape they badly beat my friend and i kicked the door in the police showed up but they behaved as though i was the guilty one we were taken to the police station together with our attackers the police let the attackers go with out even finding out who they were the attitude toward us was very humiliating it was as if we were the criminals not the victims
5429298 we feel a great freedom to pick the most interesting and provocative stories
5429299 aber wenn die frau oben ist kann sie doch nicht schwanger werden
5429300 das kann ich gar nicht kriegen ich bin ja nicht schwul oder daran dass syph tripper und co immer mal wieder gerne auf dem vormarsch sind und scheinbar niemand was davon geh rt hat da schauderts einen doch
5429301 this special limited edition will sell for 99 000 euros for a fully loaded car
5429302 this is evidenced in part by high gas prices due to gas taxes
5429303 this special limited edition will sell for 99 000 euros for a fully loaded car
5429304 the government of canada has proposed an amendment to the motor vehicle safety regulations that will harmonize the canadian bumper standard for passenger cars with similar safety standards from the u s and europe
5429305 sizable portion of our car parts and labor are paid in euros or pounds
5429306 obviously many nations use 220v 50 cycle power so the converters would be different
5429307 too bad we couldnt revive henry ford he knew how to build cheap cars
5429308 have you looked at us prices for porsches in comparison to euro prices
5429309 i dont know the details either but its obvious that the bigger the price disparity from the us to europe the bigger the incentive is to do this
5429310 fisker has a vehicle with appeal to a much larger chunk of the marketplace
5429311 it is sad when a company has to resort to litigation to compete in the marketplace
5429312 tell me how a third of a megawatt home hookup could theoretically be built
5429313 as a point of reference name a vehicle that has the styling that you would want to see for the whitestar
5429314 in the us and i think around the rest of the world a sedan is a 4 door car that has door pilars between the doors it has nothing to do with size or trunk space
5429315 ok so you think the fisker karma is ugly but would hope to see the ford focus body on the whitestar instead
5429316 i agree that the headlights need redone and i would make the windows taller which is to say doorsills lower the nose shorter and move the wheels farther to the corners
5429317 i wonder about hatchbacks they dont seem to be prevalent in the market ws seems pointed at but i dont know why never had one myself you sure seem keen on them why
5429318 and if that is a limosine there then yes a sedan here is a limosine there here in the us a limosine is a much longer car that usually seats 6 10 people
5429319 i am thinking a cross between the bmw 545 a vw eos and a fisker karma can you sketch something like that out
5429320 how did you edit your post to remove the ford focus statement as hunter and i both recall it being there
5429321 he seems to get the form of the most classic iconic vehicles every built the old jaguars and the gull wing mercedes outstanding for me maserati and lamborghini took a wrong turn looking more like stealth fighters instead of vehicles too bad they didnt go the way of the saline sr7
5429322 the four seater can travel 50 miles on a single battery charge when the battery empties the car automatically activates a one gallon fuel engine that generates enough electricity to power the car a further 450 miles
5429323 the one that gets me is the solar roof anyone serious in this industry would already know that so either fisker has no clue what they are doing or theyre just saying this as a marketing gimmick
5429324 you are missing the 2 back doors lol to make it a sedan
5429325 a private event for her close family and friends it was low key

5429328 the weaponry is amazing im going to get to fire the best guns and do this and do that
5429329 your brother is doing what hes joining the military cant you stop him
5429330 you cant really stop an eighteen year old man who signs up to fight
5429331 this is no longer a completely powerful way to make change
5429332 wow the government could really use this to tell everybody that there is free speech and do nothing
5429333 let the bodies hit the floor let the bodies hit the floor
5429334 why do you keep watching that stuff why dont you hang out with me and mom and relax
5429335 because i dont want to enjoy coming home too much i wont be able to go back
5429336 oh my god if i need to do anything based on the soldiers i need to do it with this much authenticity
5429337 oh my god i was in iraq how did you get it so accurate
5429338 wow i didnt realize that this was what it was like for a young man to go over there and put his life on the line
5429339 a verge is not a sharp border but a frontier region where the forest meets the prairie or the mountains meet the flatlands where ecosystems or ideas mingle verges between land and sea between civilization and wilderness between black and white between immigrants and natives between state and national governments between city and countryside all mark the american experience
5429340 i run into folks from web 1 0 startups fairly often that bitterly complain about how they were building web 2 0 software in 2000 but nobody came
5429341 yeah andy thats great but you should have branded that plug somehow with your logo
5429342 i dont thing getting shot down is qualification to be cic
5429343 well you suck so bad you couldnt even survive the war without getting shot down
5429344 well if you want someone experienced well ugh hint hint ugh
5429345 verbarius is the first clock in the world that tells time the way people do

5429349 leadership is the critical need that will unleash other needs around capital regulation
5429350 we need change at the state and regional level on optimizing the grid nothing will happen without a national push
5429351 i dont think there is any question that the scaling issue is possible
5429352 while we do think states play a really important role especially for the balance of power supply the big thing that is missing is strong federal authority to make sure lines are centrally planned built and sited
5429353 private enterprise will invest money and will build new transmission infrastructure cheaply and efficiently if congress adopts clear predictable policies
5429354 we must make producer tax credit permanent for a decade
5429355 congress repeated failure to act could derail the wind energy industry at the worst possible time for the economy
5429356 weve added advisory services such as financial boot camp an intensive one day finance workshop monthly powerhour lunches powerlink prot g e targeted at earlier stage companies and ceo circles our peer to peer alumni advisory program
5429357 i met lani through her banker and i was immediately impressed by her maturity
5429358 it was clear she was very serious about her business
5429359 i know how difficult it was for me as a startup to learn where to go for information and contacts
5429360 since powerlink helped me with some of my business issues i thought it would be great to serve on the powerlink panel for someone else
5429361 she was sweet intelligent very well spoken and determined to make her business a success
5429362 it was inspiring to see someone so young with so many goals i liked her story making her scrubs because she had sensitive skin how she gave them away for gifts her involvement with charities her sense of design and packaging
5429363 i am taking the advice geri gives me and using it to be sure my plan for putting simple sugars in spas will appeal to other spa owners
5429364 we must have a complete understanding of the potential threats of global warming we must put this country and the world on a path to reducing carbon emissions we certainly can do it and probably at a relatively modest cost if we have the will
5429365 this is science it is not revealed truth and there are of course some uncertainties related to this prediction of climate change unfortunately what we find is that around our central estimates things might be a little better they might be a little bit worse we have not yet found a lot better but we have found the possibility of a lot worse that is especially linked to this issue of abrupt climate changes or what are now called tipping points
5429366 rapid arctic ice and permafrost melt are the kind of events with cascading effects that tip the planets climate into an uncontrollable cycle of warming the result could be an acceleration of the melting of the ice sheets in greenland inundating coastal communities and devastating the world economy
5429367 the polar bear is completely dependent on sea ice for all of its essential behaviors including travel mating and hunting ice dependent seals they cannot hunt seals from land
5429368 methane is 21 times more powerful than carbon dioxide and remains in the atmosphere for about 12 years conservative estimates from the epa indicate that 13 of us methane emissions could be reduced by 2010 at a cost benefit or no cost
5429369 women are increasingly obtaining advanced degrees in math science and engineering yet many face obstacles when looking to advance their careers or obtain faculty positions at our countrys colleges and universities
5429370 it is critical at this time when our country is looking for ways to maintain its competitiveness that all scientists and engineers have a seat at the table at our academic institutions
5429371 todays hearing provided subcommittee members with a unique opportunity to interact directly with dr shalala and other experts to better understand why women continue to be under represented in careers in the physical sciences federal policy makers must be more proactive in stopping the leaky pipeline that results in women departing at every major transition point while pursuing careers in engineering physics technology and related fields
5429372 beyond bias and barriers fulfilling the potential of women in academic science and engineering
5429373 overcoming these cultural barriers is much more difficult than just enforcing anti discrimination laws or making university policies more family friendly
5429374 this is one in a series of hearings examining how we can break down barriers and increase opportunities for women seeking careers in math science and engineering fields
5429375 i had the privilege about a year ago of speaking at the riverside church in harlem a place where dr
5429376 it is time for us to not remain silent about this war in iraq
5429377 it is time for us to bring our men and women home from iraq
5429378 here in south carolina we talk about the corridor of shame brothers and sisters we must turn the corridor of shame into a corridor of hope and opportunity for the people of south carolina we as a nation have an opportunity to deal with this great moral issue so brothers and sisters my message for today is that were in this today we are united in this effort to create hope and opportunity and it is time for us to say enough is enough were better than this the united states of america is better than this it is time for us to stand up speak out rise up together as one people and create the kind of america that all of us believe in and all of us are fighting for
5429379 any file that is executing on the computer system as a program e g an exe com dll cpl or other binary program file format is normally prevented by the file system from being opened for write or delete access reporting a sharing violation despite the fact that the program is not opened by any application however some access is still allowed for example a running application file can be renamed or copied read even when executing
5429380 is it possible that the book of genesis is simply another parable gods way of warning us of the dangers of the world by telling us a story when eve reaches up and touches the forbidden fruit and loses paradise and is driven from the perfect happiness of eden is it possible that god is speaking to us today what is it that will destroy our perfect home what is it that will drive us out of paradise and into unknown lands what is it that will take away from us everything we have known and loved and thanked god for every single day of our lives
5429381 student evaluations of law teaching work well strongly agree agree neutral disagree strongly disagree
5429382 can be a slippery slope until we set some guidelines
5429383 i gave all the actors the road to read to get their heads right bout this sort of existential detachment that living in a post apocalyptic world would bring
5429384 were in a very large post apocalyptic environment the bombs have gone off and theres very little left people are wandering through lonely landscapes we want to capture that by way of david lean photographic expanses so you think youre looking at lawrence of arabia so far so good
5429385 i think the first two pictures took those ideas so seriously
5429386 we wanted to make sure we did that as well
5429387 desde hace muchos a os antes de yo ser alcalde vienen hablando de establecer una incineradora de basura en el barrio cambalache al este de la ciudad que afectar a a miles de residentes en la zona urbana
5429388 mientras yo sea alcalde no endosar ning n proyecto contaminante que afecte nuestra salud
5429389 if quality problems do exist in the school buildings those found responsible will be dealt with severely
5429390 rent control refers to laws or ordinances that set price controls on the renting of residential housing it functions as a price ceiling
5429391 which while illegal is not uncommon and so how likely is it that low income families acquire rent stabilized apartments through these means almost never
5429392 the protection afforded by the new york rent control law to residents like myself from the escalation in market price that is pressuring so many of us to leave a community we can no longer afford
5429393 designing and flying satellites is a difficult business and even with years of experience there are always frustrations in bringing new ones into service
5429394 in the early 1990s the general accounting office told congress that the generation of goes satellites then in development was in serious trouble the instruments were behind schedule the program cost had more than doubled and it still was not clear when the satellites would be launched at least today we are not in the position of having the last goes satellite in orbit with its fuel tanks almost empty
5429395 it appears that the program cost estimate will be around 8 billion by the time we receive the presidents budget request this year this is some 1 billion more than the estimate admiral lautenbacher gave us last year that is not a good trend
5429396 it concerns me to find out that we are operating with both an acting program director and acting deputy program director and that noaas first attempt to fill the deputys slot couldnt find someone for the job there appears to be strong disagreement between our witnesses about the relationship between nasa and noaa in terms of managing the space segment of the goes program
5429397 bet edwards will win the focus groups again he is dominating the debate
5429398 8 35 pm he is dominating the debate so far extremely well informed on the subjects hes being asked and he seems to be relishing his role as the third wheel because the two fighting children are forced to listen to him again on points he seems to win these debates
5429399 mr edwards is having a pretty good night hes kind of a palette cleanser
5429400 mr edwards is having a pretty good night maybe his 4 percent showing in nevada has liberated him in some fashion hes looser than usual and as we said before without a dog in the fight hes coming across as an impartial observer hes kind of a palette cleanser
5429401 are there three people in this debate not two edwards asked we have got to understand this is not about us personally its about what we are trying to do for this country edwards said to applause from the audience
5429402 john edwards is probably winning on points and tone pushing his message effectively
5429403 and so far john edwards is probably winning on points and tone taking obama off his game but pushing his message effectively even from the sidelines of the main event
5429404 yet while clinton and obama exchanged their personal barbs john edwards broke through with the best arguments of the night
5429405 yet while clinton and obama exchanged their personal barbs john edwards broke through with the best arguments of the night
5429406 first black president edwards outlined a vision of racial and economic equality where every american is of equal value
5429407 obama isnt the best debater on the stage we still think that person is edwards
5429408 nobody does the personal story better than edwards on this stage
5429409 nobody does the personal story better than edwards on this stage perhaps bill clinton can do it better than edwards but im not sure edwards is good perhaps even better than the master of feeling your pain bill clinton
5429410 john edwards comes out most forcefully against the presidents stimulus package and its what dr king would want too
5429411 8 14 pm john edwards comes out most forcefully against the presidents stimulus package and its what dr king would want too he goes after trade as well finding a distinction off the bat
5429412 the candidates tend to explain their policy decisions using short tern and the lingua franca of the senate which makes it hard to referee these disputes so the candidates who refuse to jump in usually wind up looking better and john edwards is looking better
5429413 battery wear and tear due to bi directional power cycling is not fully understood and could potentially have a cost impact greater than the benefit produced
5429414 i would also imagine that the grid operator wouldnt want all the plug in vehicles to start or stop charging at exactly the same time so there needs to be some way to slightly randomize the response to the operators requests
5429415 more generally isnt all this concern about how much renewable generation we can reasonably install a little premature
5429416 current thinking in newspapers might be that renewables with variable production need backup power but this is not true in any meaningful sense
5429417 second objection is that you shouldnt control the loading of the vehicles based on the production from renewables it should be based on the cost of electricity
5429418 two smaller motors are of necessity heavier than one larger motor of equivalent total power replication of motor inverter electronics each motor will require its own expensive complex inverter in the end a differential plus a pair of shafts is more reliable and more efficient than a second inverter and a second motor especially when the two inverters must act in coordination
5429419 well there young feller weve had that energy unit in our family for three generations transplanting it from car to car
5429420 look this is how much electricity i used ill pay you per kilowatt at the rate of your choice
5429421 in 2006 the world wide web became a tool for bringing together the small contributions of millions of people and making them matter the cover storys lead author lev grossman then starts off with some fairly inspired prose after noting that there are still serious problems in the word which aregrowing in conjunction with this apparent technological utopia writing but look at 2006 through a different lens and youll see another story one that isnt about conflict or great men its a story about community and collaboration on a scale never seen before its about the cosmic compendium of knowledge wikipedia and the million channel peoples network youtube and the online metropolis myspace its about the many wresting power from the few and helping one another for nothing and how that will not only change the world but also change the way the world changes the cynical among us will find some of levs analysis to be starry eyed and excessively optimistic but calling out web 2 0 by name the person of the year cover story makes careful note that the mass participation were witnessing on a grand scale on the internet cuts both ways sure its a mistake to romanticize all this any more than is strictly necessary web 2 0 harnesses the stupidity of crowds as well as its wisdom some of the comments on youtube make you weep for the future of humanity just for the spelling alone never mind the obscenity and the naked hatred but the lead story is just the beginning and time has prepared an extravaganza of supporting material and documention in the form of fourteen separate stories that range across the web 2 0 terrain covering subjects from the beast with a billion eyes on the web anyone with a digital camera has the power to change history
5429422 imperial is one of the first universities in the uk to be trialling this sort of technology it is a really exciting opportunity to show everyone within the college how applied game based learning in a multi user virtual environment muve can be used to enhance face to face teaching
5429423 men look at women women watch themselves being looked at
5429424 in my home state of tennessee 37 bridges were found to be deficient by a road improvement survey in 2005 my colleagues on the committee could all share similar statistics clearly the disaster that struck minnesota could have happened anywhere
5429425 this is a wakeup call that we need to be doing more to strengthen and secure our bridges now and for the long term
5429426 we are a nation of infrastructure and more than any other country in the world we rely on a massive interconnected web of power lines and power plants telecommunications facilities train tracks roadways and bridges to go about our everyday lives
5429427 ensuring the safety of our basic infrastructure must be a top priority of our federal state and local governments
5429428 successfully and efficiently addressing the nations infrastructure issues bridges and highways included will require a long term comprehensive nationwide strategy one that includes research and identifying potential financing methods and investment requirements for the safety and security of our families we as a nation can no longer afford to ignore this growing problem
5429429 the i 35w bridge collapse was both a tragedy and wake up call to the country the departments inspector general will be monitoring all of the investigations into the collapse and reviewing our inspection and funding programs to decide and advise us what short and long term actions we may need to take to improve the program a top to bottom review is underway to make sure that everything is being done to keep this kind of tragedy from occurring again we look forward to continuing to work with congress to give the people of this nation the safe efficient and effective transportation system that they expect and deserve
5429430 of course new technologies are only useful insofar as they are adopted by builders and inspectors i hope to hear more about technology transfer programs and what we can all do to make innovative technologies more accessible to the hardworking engineers and inspectors that need them
5429431 the temperatures generated by body heat could produce enough electricity to charge the batteries in small technology ideally this finding could lead to special clothing and other wearable materials that produce electrical current for batteries in cell phones and handheld computers or power the devices themselves
5429432 personal power jackets that could use heat from the human body to recharge cell phones and other electronic devices
5429433 toch heb ik zon vermoeden dat juist heel veel mensen dit kookboek wel aanspreekt

5429435 you do you know how many people you are championing
5429436 i did feel at last truly at peace i had found my place i was no longer ashamed

5429439 top 10 standard features you use all the time except 10 and 9 which are useless gimmicks but which we had to add because no one does top 8s
5429440 the possibility of a world transformed by climate change is not a science fiction image of a post apocalyptic society it is not a road warrior movie it is happening now
5429441 after listening to leaders of the scientific business and governmental communities my colleagues and i came to agree that global climate change is and will be a significant threat to our national security and in a larger sense to life on earth as we know it to be
5429442 can we better prepare to protect our national security interests by conducting research that will predict what consequences can come from global warming and where can we be better prepared by conducting research into how to mitigate the consequences of global warming
5429443 i think we can and i know this committee can help insure that research gets underway and is properly utilized for the better protection of the american people
5429444 the foreign policy and national security implications of global climate change
5429445 im not going to comment specifically on what russian units or equipment are in the area right now
5429446 but let me be clear if it rolled in after august 6 it needs to roll out that would be in keeping with the russians commitment on withdrawal
5429447 anything such as that or any other military equipment that was moved in would be in violation of this ceasefire and should be removed immediately
5429448 we will continue to closely monitor russian actions in georgia for confirmation of the withdrawal this is something that should be achieved without delay
5429449 we have indeed come along way as a nation of explorers when we can look to the sky and know that both the iss and our space shuttle are being commanded by such extraordinary women commanders peggy whitson and pamela melroy are truly among the best in their field and we are especially proud of their efforts to advance u s space exploration they are serving to inspire the next generation of female scientists and space pioneers and i wish them and the crew of sts 120 all the best as they embark on this most challenging of missions
5429450 i want to wish the entire crew of sts 120 a safe and successful mission to the international space station they have a very challenging and complex set of tasks awaiting them many of them unprecedented but their efforts will serve to add a new room to the iss and prepare it for the upcoming addition of the international laboratories when the shuttle returns to earth well also be able to welcome home clayton anderson who has been aboard the iss since june
5429451 these sexist jerks actually thought they were being cute gag me with a spoon
5429452 sit back relax and let your customers create your products
5429453 web 2 0 is what happened while we were waiting for the semantic web
5429454 this has been two camps posturing and positioning so far doing everything from a distance away from the dividing line
5429455 now with this move ea has basically said were not going to go forward as outsiders you need to let us into the tent to see whats in the pipeline
5429456 all customers should get the same level of service but in order to achieve this they dont necessarily all need to be treated the same by your sales or customer service department
5429457 dividing your customer base into groups based on their attributes means that you can offer each group a more specialised service tailored to their specific requirements
5429458 the secret to providing good customer service is simple offer each customer exactly what they need nothing more nothing less
5429459 it is better to regret something you have done than to regret something you havent done
5429460 im done arguing with you about this marriage thing so i will let you enjoy your little funky plan for now but im pretty sure that in two years time you will come around begging me to find you a good girl
5429461 i would go on with my life somewhere down the road i would meet someone i would get to know her fall in love and marry her
5429462 we must give up the life we planned in order to receive the life that is waiting for us
5429463 the case for change is overwhelming the law and its framework lack clarity
5429464 the technology enabling the collection and sharing of large amounts of personal data continues to advance but public confidence in how personal information is safeguarded is evaporating our package of recommendations is aimed at transforming the way personal information is collected managed used and shared
5429465 the regulatory system governing data sharing needs to have much more bite and reform is now long overdue there is undoubtedly a lot of confusion and uncertainty particularly about the law
5429466 the risks in the information age are also very real particularly if organisations are cavalier about sharing
5429467 the regulatory system governing data sharing needs to have much more bite and reform is now long overdue
5429468 theres a significant lack of public trust in data handling in general and data sharing in particular
5429469 theres got to be clear governance and accountability who is responsible for getting it right if the top managers are assuming techie people are responsible that wouldnt be right if the techies assume hr are doing it that wouldnt be right
5429470 we feel that selling the edited register is an unsatisfactory way for local authorities to treat personal information it sends a particularly poor message to the public that personal information collected for something as vital as participation in the democratic process can be sold to anyone for any purpose the sale of the electoral register deters some people from registering at all we therefore recommend that the government removes the provision allowing the sale of the edited electoral register the edited register would therefore no longer serve any purpose and so should be abolished
5429471 our view is that as a matter of principle electoral registers should be compiled exclusively for electoral and other limited statutory purposes and that they should not be made available for sale for commercial purposes
5429472 removing access to the edited register for data cleaning purposes will make it harder for marketers to target accurately and effectively
5429473 everyone agrees that direct mail should be correctly targeted and access to the edited electoral register is an efficient way of verifying data to do just that
5429474 marketers use data from many different sources to help with accurate targeting and the edited register is an additional layer to ensure data accuracy removing access to the edited register for data cleaning purposes will make it harder for marketers to target accurately and effectively
5429475 the tenor of the governments argument has focused closely on the benefits of data sharing paying perhaps too little attention to the potential hazards associated with ambitious programmes of data sharing
5429476 the government has consistently laid itself open to the criticism that it considers data sharing in itself an unconditional good and that it will go to considerable lengths to encourage data sharing programmes while paying insufficient heed to the corresponding risks or to peoples legitimate concerns
5429477 a large majority of contributors to the review expressed the consistent and strongly held view that the information commissioner and his office have neither adequate powers nor sufficient resources to promote or enforce proper information management practices
5429478 the government is already working on possible amendments to the powers available to the information commissioner and the funding arrangements for his office to support the exercise of any new powers
5429479 we will assess the other recommendations in the report in further detail and issue a more detailed statement once we have had time to fully consider the implications and costs of bringing about such changes
5429480 when you check into a hotel they dont need to know your name and address they just need to know that the bill will be paid

5429482 a new feature that truly differentiates novoking from sl and hipihi is that it allows users to upload their own content created in photoshop 3dmax and maya so besides aiming for just the newbies the developers at novoking have left plenty of room for the more experienced content creators too
5429483 not sure what you mean by rolling out the inworld animation tool sven i know someone now who does poses and animations in world i just dont recall the name of the app
5429484 as for charging 20 an upload well preposturous is the first word that comes to mind
5429485 i am talking about adding three tools to the modeling ability of the tool set they already have the basis of those tools in the tool kit sven your solution would cost more in time and money then it is worth
5429486 hiring someone or even a team of someones just to certify uploads dude do the math whats the final cost if you pay a five person team for this job hourly benefits 401k seriously why
5429487 my main objective is to start a conversation around why you dont think portability has become common place for the end user by now
5429488 q sculpted prims are limited to 32 32 vertices at their highest resolution if ive uploaded a 256 256 sculpt map how can i get the sculpted prim to show that detail
5429489 why do you think there used to be only very limited prim tools in sl from the very beginning until the very recent addition of sculpties
5429490 why do you think there wasnt the ability to import any mesh from the very beginning
5429491 why do you think there are just a certain amount of prims possible in a sim
5429492 the more prims there are the more vertices faces polygons they have the bigger is the rendering weight
5429493 the word of the lord you have spoken is good

5429497 we build from the present as we build on this world of software plus services well build it together
5429498 this isnt going to happen overnight in the enterprise world but what you need to be able to do is know that the wording the training the investments you are making today will seamlessly move to the new world
5429499 im not going to tell you the world of the future looks exactly like the world of today we all know thats not true there will be businesses that youre in today that wont exist 10 years from now because the technology will have advanced so far

5429502 we have great hosting partners but the best you can do is the best you can do with our existing server products hosted and managed well were basically reinventing some of the server software particularly as it relates to scalability geo caching and replication management cost of operation and all of the improvements well make in order to do our own cloud services which are necessary theyre innovation that we and we alone can do we will also repackage back over time into our server offering there will be customers who want to work on our scale platform in the cloud there are going to be customers though who want hosted dedicated solutions from partners we will support both

5429504 this is hard everyone of us has to embrace the fact that a lot has changed and will continue to change as a partner of microsoft your business must change as well we need you to be successful with online services in order for us to be successful
5429505 for our partners its a no brainer to engage and be listed
5429506 we think its a great way for our partners to get exposure and a connection to our customers and prospects
5429507 we want our broad partner base to embrace crm online as a way to handle their customer management needs
5429508 our goal is to provide thought leadership to our partner community on the business model evolution required by the software plus services landscape
5429509 after a year spent building and tuning the new vehicle in its software services strategy microsoft has handed the keys to its partners and told them its theirs to drive and to customise
5429510 microsoft says it is committed to helping partners succeed after all it depends on them for some 96 of its revenues to that end it describes a number of ways in which partners can leverage the new model
5429511 key to partners success will be their ability to provide some additional value on top of the plain vanilla hosted solution perhaps by helping customers migrate from other platforms or often by customising the subscription services for the particular industries they serve
5429512 microsoft is clearly encroaching on some partners that have themselves been providing plain vanilla hosted solutions based on microsofts products but the vendor has been signaling its intentions for some time so this weeks announcements should take no one by surprise nor is the need for partners to provide higher value solutions unexpected after all plain vanilla hosting is destined to become a low margin commodity business if it isnt one already to a large extent microsoft is simply accelerating a transition that partners would face anyway but its also offering them tools they would otherwise have to create by themselves

5429515 it was always my dream to come to berklee to study drums under mike mangini
5429516 if you think the fact that we have sold in excess of 2 million records and have never been paid a penny is pretty unbelievable well so do we and the fact that emi informed us that not only arent they going to pay us at all but that we are still 1 4 million dollars in debt to them is even crazier
5429517 the best way to describe the concours delegance is nascar meets the kentucky derby
5429518 we hosted well over 100 people it was a great showing from among our nearly 600 members

5429523 the most important invention for them since the mobile radio
5429524 we wanted to fit our information to our business needs not just to build a fancy information system
5429525 the department believed in that legacy system and business logic so if we could deliver a system that played off of that not only could we go to market sooner but wed have the buy in from staffers

5429547 the only minor shortcoming we felt was slightly increased understeer entering corners
5429548 as it neared empty the tesla automatically went into a conservation mode that limited torque by 50 percent that made the indicated 7 percent at full power jump to 21 percent remaining charge at half power when the controller opens reserve capacity in the battery pack
5429549 the only minor shortcoming we felt was slightly increased understeer entering corners
5429550 the ceo should have given them more time and more money
5429551 that is why martin was let go because he was satisfied with his 95 in spite of what he promised investors and customers

5429561 traverse city mich general motors corp has signed an agreement with a battery maker that could propel it ahead of toyota motor corp in the race to bring plug in hybrid and electric cars to market a top company official said thursday
5429562 a123 systems inc based in watertown mass already produces millions of nanophosphate lithium ion batteries for use in cordless power tools and it plans to apply the technology to automobiles
5429563 gm vice chairman bob lutz said the deal coupled with a published report that toyota motor corp
5429564 goal is ultimately to get people to stop burning gasoline in their cars
5429565 tesla motors will remain focused on building the best electric cars for the foreseeable future
5429566 i realize that most believe that an all electric ev is the best option given that it completely removes dependence on gasoline however ive previously suggested and still standby the fact that a car like the blue star will have a greater net benefit to the environment and the consumer if a such a serial hybrid configuration is at least made available
5429567 august 16 2006 front and center on the first page which is slightly misleading if you dont know about the smaller revision note down on the bottom of the last page i still think the update footnote should appear next to the original publish date not buried down at the end
5429568 he agreed that working battery pack prototypes will be coming from both battery teams this fall interestingly it is expected that different test versions of the volt will be built each with different battery packs from the two manufacturing teams he also told me that a decision has been made to use liquid cooling and not air systems for the packs

5429572 the warm up time power loss component malfunction you dont get those problems with integrated devices when you transfer power from one component to another you lose energy but you lose less energy in an integrated device
5429573 if we stack 500 sheets together in a ream thats 500 times the voltage if we rip the paper in half we cut power by 50 so we can control the power and voltage issue
5429574 i wouldnt want the ionic liquid electrolytes in my body but it works without them
5429575 you can implant a piece of paper in the body and blood would serve as an electrolyte
5429576 batteries and capacitors are being steadily improved but electricity storage is much more difficult and expensive than liquid fuels and probably will be so forever
5429577 the world is not going to change as a result of this new invention any time soon
5429578 the devices were making are only a few inches across we would have to scale up to sheets of newspaper size to make it commercially viable
5429579 im a strong enthusiast of electric vehicles but it is going to take time to bring the costs down
5429580 they are ultimately easier to manufacture more environmentally friendly and usable in a wide range of devices
5429581 ford shunned green and did not believe in accountants he was a pacifist who opposed war which he thought was a waste of time
5429582 he knew what he was able to do socially and economically in the u s and he figured that he could apply that model to the depressed area of cork
5429583 though not formally educated ford had a global vision with consumerism as the key to peace he put a dealership in every north american city and in major cities on six continents
5429584 this week i move from the ceo position to become president of technology and i remain on teslas board of directors in my new job i will focus on the final details of the roadster and on advancing teslas leadership in our core technology i will also be able to spend more time with you our customers my passion is for creating technology that brings about meaningful change and for the people who embrace such technology as we move towards production and contemplate the choices ahead of us we at tesla need leadership with that same kind of passion and talent for operations passion that will secure teslas future as the next major automobile company
5429585 dont doubt martin initiated the search the only surprise is that the board would take on some temp ceo over martin with 5 years of experience and knowlege of all facets of the business what is the time to get up to speed to get even a fraction of the knowledge of martin and then he is gone and they need to start over
5429586 i think too theres a hope that with enough buying power tesla will be able to specify a battery chemistry attuned to automotive applications rather than consumer electronics
5429587 if all goes according to plan by 2009 you could be sticking it to big oil by driving an all electric chinese made sedan for little more than the cost of a camry the xs 500 has a top speed of 80 miles per hour and a range of 120 miles at 60 miles per hour both the low cost and the high range can be attributed to china where low labor costs keep the price down and state sponsored research into battery technology yielded what rubin said was an advanced lithium ion power pack produced by lishen battery

5429592 itll never work and if it works itll never sell and if it sells itll break down every five minutes and all the directors are evil con men just out to rip off your grandmother
5429593 these liberal elitist hippies actually hate these ugly looking pieces of trash theyre not worth an eighth of what theyre selling for unless youre from hollywood
5429594 i am halibut ed proud of what we have built here at tesla motors and though with hindsight i might have done better i am not ashamed of any of our setbacks our overriding philosophy has always been to deliver quality cars as soon as we can rather than to meet a schedule that might compromise the cars
5429595 a world of 100 hybrids is still 100 addicted to oil
5429596 electric cars move our choice of energy source upstream from the vehicle making them the ultimate multi fuel vehicles
5429597 gm seems to be trapped in the same thinking that hobbled so many ev ventures in the past if they cant see the way to make an inexpensive electric car as their first model they cant see the business case for evs at all why dont they think this way about the corvette or the escalade for that matter
5429598 hub motors whats with the obsession about hub motors or to put it more succinctly what problem what actual real problem would hub motors solve they wont improve performance they wont improve efficiency they wont improve reliability they wont improve safety they wont reduce program risk
5429599 and that means charging stations like gas stations are soon to be as obsolete as cigarette lighter chargers for our phones
5429600 maybe i was a bit naive expecting to hold the line on mass those of us at tesla motors who have a long automotive experience say that fixes to problems discovered at this stage of the program always add mass
5429601 i find it quite amusing to see so many car companies now embracing li ion batteries when only last july most said that li ion was not the way to go for cars
5429602 nobody makes anything like the tesla motors ess its impossible to hire people with
5429603 i actually dont have a good suggestion about how to encourage consumers to make fuel efficient choices other than to make great electric cars
5429604 unfortunately the limits of current battery technolgy mean full electric vehicles with petrol car performance arent on the cards for now

5429607 ive noticed none of the big hot rod mags have acknowledged the tesla roadster
5429608 a fully electric car can use a battery pack as large 30 batteries if the batteries cost 1 000 each thats 30 000 dollars electric cars will cost around 40 000 plus the cost of the batteries total cost 70 000 for
5429609 a person who never made a mistake never tried anything new
5429610 they will no doubt complain about the lack of engine roar another selling point for me personally and they will point out that an 08 corvette will match the 0 60 acceleration has a higher top speed and costs about half as much
5429611 here we are on the eve of the tesla roadsters start of production
5429612 we are working to the general timeframe of delivering founders series cars this year signature 100 cars in q1 2008 and other customers cars after q1 depending on when you placed your reservation
5429613 the tesla electric sports car has an idiotic battery pack of li on laptop batteries 8631 of them that cost 20 000 what do you think a nanosafe battery pack will cost to drive the roadster 200 miles
5429614 crash sensors inductors main frame service plug and etc see http www a123systems com newsite index php
5429615 i initiated a ceo search many months ago as tesla motors has grown in size and complexity beyond twice the size and at least five times the complexity of any organization i have run before
5429616 and we have accomplished one more big thing we got the world to re think electric cars
5429617 and you have a set of panels on your roof that can provide rest from storage
5429618 in response to a solar car cover i ran the numbers and figured you could fit 12 of the large power film strips on a roadster car cover
5429619 that would be exactly the punishment car tesla is talking about tiny three wheeler for handicaps a boosted up electric wheelchair with cabin nobody and i mean nobody would buy such a car
5429620 ten years ago people tried the prius because it was a toyota
5429621 today people are buying toyotas because we have the prius
5429622 hyatt will install tesla recharging stations at three hotels stretching in an arc from san francisco to lake tahoe the two companies announced the agreement wednesday at hyatts fishermans wharf hotel where a handful of surprised tourists watched mayor gavin newsom take one of the gleaming all electric sports cars for a spin
5429623 by placing rechargers at hyatts at fishermans wharf sacramento and incline village on tahoes north shore a tesla owner could drive from san francisco to the lake without fear of running out of juice
5429624 a technological breakthrough required to make this concept a reality is a large lithium ion battery
5429625 aoife could you please explain why we are standing here rather than out there finalizing the vows
5429626 your majesty your daughter needs to speak with you about something of grave importance
5429627 i am here waiting patiently father aoife say what you need to say
5429628 father i am with child i am pregnant with finns baby
5429629 i dont quite understand is this just a way to keep you from marrying de clare
5429630 how can i expect him to take you as your wife now not only are you ruined but you have another mans baby in your womb this is outrageous this was the perfect match why did this happen everything is ruined
5429631 king dermot please calm down your daughter needs your understanding and your love she shouldnt be mistreated she has gone through enough
5429632 father i need to see finn i need to tell him please take me to him
5429633 did you think i would have kept him here while your wedding was taking place that would be foolish and risky
5429634 you must take me to him father why dont you care about what i need
5429635 yes i am certain the signs and symptoms are unmistakable
5429636 do you take me for a fool i release him and then you disappear shortly thereafter he is far away where he can cause no trouble
5429637 but i suppose he has caused enough trouble already hasnt he
5429638 what do you mean you said she was virginal did you purposely deceive me
5429639 i did not know she has informed me that the one incident occurred not much more than a month ago i had no knowledge of it
5429640 what am i to do tell me what should i do
5429641 oh no even you cant solve this one aoife is with child she just told her father today what do i do now
5429642 i like this woman william i mean i really like her now its all impossible
5429643 yes i know but how can i compete with the other man now when she will have his baby as a constant memory of him
5429644 it shouldnt be about the girl it is about accomplishing the task at hand marry her on paper only then focus on what we came to do
5429645 i dont want to marry just for tactical reasons i feel something i have never felt before
5429646 if i were you i would avoid the emotional aspect of marriage it complicates everything
5429647 a student receives a dollars worth of education for perhaps twenty five cents the universitys other costs are supported by the taxpayers which means the farmers and factory workers and business people of one of the fifty states
5429648 another way to look at this is that every student admitted to an american university receives an unstated scholarship or perhaps a subsidy from american society every state debates the amount of money allocated for higher education each year every state wants to keep education fees low to benefit its own low income students but every year states agree to use tens or hundreds of millions of dollars to subsidize the students that come from foreign nations these billions of dollars demonstrate a true american commitment to diversity and international understanding
5429649 the pla peoples liberation army has established information warfare units to develop viruses to attack enemy computer systems and networks
5429650 i will support and defend the constitution of the united states against all enemies foreign and domestic and i will bear true faith and allegiance to the same
5429651 this is exactly the kind of situation we anticipated and is the reason for the slow initial ramp in the early going it is easier to address issues that inevitably crop up and then get back on track without major impact to the overall schedule one thing is for certain we will not sacrifice quality or customer satisfaction to force the schedule
5429652 just because you have that much torque doesnt mean you have to use it
5429653 elon musk the founder of tesla motors said here saturday that he plans to take his electric sports car company public by the end of 2008

5429657 signature 100 group of vehicles is going to have a special distinction
5429658 it shouldnt make any difference to the battery load or the pem in terms of gear ratio below 60 mph an electric motor in a lower gear consumes more current than the same motor turning slower in a higher gear what really counts is that the energy to accellerate the car from 0 to 60 in 4 seconds is the same no mater what method is used to propel it ignoring efficiencies
5429659 the higher current levels are generating the expected higher levels of torque 280 lb ft that will enable the same 3 9 second 0 60 acceleration with the new single speed gearbox under development
5429660 the higher current levels are generating the expected higher levels of torque 280 lb ft
5429661 pound foot is used by engine manufacturers in specifying the torque output of an engine
5429662 a rose my any other name would still accelerate as fast
5429663 a measure of how much a force acting on an object causes that object to rotate
5429664 here in europe we consider a good gearshift as part of the art of driving
5429665 er excuse me can i just plug my car in
5429666 i dont really understand why you have to be personal
5429667 we plan to establish service facilities in key european cities starting with london paris munich northern germany milan oslo copenhagen this list is being finalized
5429668 tesla is also hard at work on model 2 the mid size luxury sports sedan which will be unveiled in the first half of next year
5429669 you should have just left her alone now i have to kill you
5429670 if you do this aoife still will not return to you you will have less of a chance than you have now
5429671 this is not about getting aoife back i never had her it was always you who she wanted so if i cant have her than you wont either
5429672 dont try and run and put that toy away you are no match for me with that
5429673 this isnt going to be as easy as you think
5429674 i cant kill you you are the king i only wanted to avoid being killed
5429675 value proposition for information technology organisations to do more with less has promoted even broader customer adoption of our products and services in the current macro economic environment
5429676 as a result of this growing trend 48 of our deals over 100 000 were with customers that plan to use informatica for more than data warehousing
5429677 our value proposition for information technology organisations to do more with less has promoted even broader customer adoption of our products and services in the current macro economic environment
5429678 customer adoption of the latest informatica data integration release continues to grow hasbro the leading toy maker selected informatica for our proven high performance and cost effective scalability electrolux premier manufacturer of appliance chose informatica for their universal data access required by their project to migrate data into an sap application from 20 systems
5429679 in europe a leading logistics provider deutsche post world net has adopted informatica across all three lines of business dhl the german mail system and post bank
5429680 deutsche post adopted informatica to expedite results across a broad range of projects including consolidation of customer applications and data quality projects
5429681 within europe we continue to benefit from very strong performance in germany
5429682 we are very pleased with the consistent performance that we have attained in southern europe primarily in france we are also very pleased with the progress we have made in germany in terms of the macro economic impact we have not seen that across all of europe clearly we have not seen any of that in any of the eastern european economies the closest that we have seen any signs that there might be an impact would be in the uk however overall europe continues to do extremely well for us
5429683 we commented that we had seen some different patterns in the buying behaviour of our customers and we took steps in order for us to adjust our processes and our organisation
5429684 the team has done an exceptional job having the discipline to have much better linearity in the second quarter
5429685 in fact we closed some of the larger transactions much earlier in the quarter we expect that our customers will continue to have a little more scrutiny in terms of the purchasing process however as our value proposition is for customers to do more with us we find that our customers find that particularly appealing in times like this where they are looking for operational efficiency
5429686 the software as a service trend was one that we were the first among the data integration of vendors to recognise
5429687 but we went a step beyond that we actually now have delivered the third integration as a service i commented on a few customers that have subscribed to it and there is a huge interest in the third service that we announced called data loader which provides bi directional integration between salesforce com and any other source including google docs and that is generating a lot of excitement it gives us a very tier differentiation versus every other data integration vendor we are the only one that provides a complete enough solution to integrate both on premise as well as off premise data
5429688 we have validated our strategy we have repeatedly demonstrated the operational discipline we have confirmed the customer demand we have diversified our business across the geographic regions we have diversified it across the various verticals we have the strongest product line that we have had ever with the 8 6 and all of those things give us a lot of reason to be optimistic however the macroeconomic uncertainty clearly provides reason to be prudent
5429689 informatica might look financially solid but its not an immovable oak as yet
5429690 it hasnt been entirely immune to a soft economy which has resulted in a see sawing north american financial services business informaticas strongest vertical over the past year
5429691 it kind of dropped and then maybe you had a kind of bounce and then just kind of stayed there for a while
5429692 what happened aoife you had the baby today all alone
5429693 i came here early this morning and that is when it started actually i think it started yesterday will all of my back pain
5429694 a boy how wonderful lorcan is a fine name my i hold him aoife
5429695 well he was here when i arrived this morning i had no idea that anyone was here but i am very thankful because without him i would not have been able to deliver the baby
5429696 okay so now that i am here we leave and go back to the castle right
5429697 you are my wife and you will go home with me right
5429698 you know i cant do that aoife it is more complicated now we are married in the eyes of god the church wouldnt allow a divorce
5429699 you said you would try and make a life with me
5429700 i said that when i thought i would never see finn again he is here now we have our baby please let me go richard
5429701 what about last night aoife the church wont allow an annulment now
5429702 i was overcome with grief finn and we did something we shouldnt have
5429703 it was the only time the first and last time finn
5429704 she should be lying down after what she went though today
5429705 she doesnt want you be man enough to let her go
5429706 aoife this all needs to end we are a family and you are the queen we are both rulers of leinster without you i cannot rule king henry will take the kingdom and give it to someone who will not care like we do your father would not want just any earl from england to oversee his land you need to think about this
5429707 let him go richard tell your brother to unhand him
5429708 i cannot let you leave aoife not only because i love you but because i will not let king henry take this land from us everything will change here in a matter of months all of ireland will belong to him dont you understand
5429709 no i dont all i know is that since you came here everything has changed you brought these people here and now our country is suffering just as i have suffered
5429710 what will happen to finn you and your brother will come back and do something to him like you were going to do today i cannot trust you now
5429711 i suppose i do do you promise that once king henry leaves we will seek an annulment
5429712 then the answer is no i will not go with you i am not open to discuss anything i will stay so you can keep the kingdom but then i will return to finn
5429713 47 5 of attached active listings were vacant or tenanted
5429714 considering that dubai gets 4 000 wind hours annually the turbines incorporated into the building can generate 1 200 000 kilowatt hour of energy
5429715 i wouldnt worry too much about magazine testers from car and driver road amp track and the like lots of them have road racing experience under their belts
5429716 i continue to believe that attending a weekend autocross or driving clinic should be a must for the new owner of any super car including the tesla roadster not only will this minimize the risk of costly carbon fiber repair but it will also enable new owners to realize the truly spectacular level of performance that the tesla roadster has to offer
5429717 for those interested in a discussion of the static vs dynamic mass and in particular the distinction between sprung unsprung and rotating mass as it applies to the design and driving experience of the tesla roadster please stay tuned for the second half of this blog to be published at a later date
5429718 driven tires have less rolling resistance than free wheeling ones
5429719 would imagine that a less experienced driver would have to deal with the constantly changing content weight of the gas tank and how it effects the weight distribution
5429720 the problem becomes when running the g loads one might experience on sticky r compound tires the pickup for the fuel pump can run pull air and cause power to cut out
5429721 the tank has a synthetic bladder inside to minimize evaporative emissions the bladder expands and contracts with the fuel volume minimizing the air gap over the fuel which minimizes fuel evaporation which can escape during filling or venting in a non bladder system this bladder can become less flexible in cooler weather which will keep you from fitting a full 11 9 gallons in the tank
5429722 the company sees the possibility that its customers will be able to take advantage of v2g technology and phevs by providing power to their home or businesses during hot summer days to avoid high energy prices and help prevent outages

5429724 anyhow if you start counting electrons you might as well count the molecules of rubber left on the pavement
5429725 we give new meaning to the words plug and play
5429726 aoife what are you doing here he asked desperately as he hugged her as tight as he could without crushing her midsection
5429727 should you be out on your own in your condition
5429728 what do you mean intrude i would have expected you to come and take me away from all of that i still love you finn
5429729 i didnt even think i just saw you with him yesterday and
5429730 i dont know i dont know anything about this aoife
5429731 its only two miles to oflatterys manor i am sure someone is there who will know what to do
5429732 no what if something should happen while you are gone please stay with me maybe it will stop
5429733 i can believe it i have been believing it for many months i have so much to tell you finn
5429734 we are pleased that noaa is sending mr proenza back to the southern region his experience and talents were too important for the weather service to lose and he was widely admired for his work in the region we recommended that he resume his post as director of the southern region and we believe this is the best outcome given the circumstances it would also have been grossly unfair to give mr proenza a drastic demotion given the conflicting accounts of what happened at the tropical prediction center tpc
5429735 we remain concerned about how noaa will get the tpc headed in the right direction mr proenza initiated precisely the kinds of culture challenging changes that the turner review identified to keep the tpc at the forefront of predictive science after pulling proenza out of the center just a few months into his tenure due to discontent among the hurricane forecasting staff we wonder how noaa can recruit new leadership that will implement a new agenda to address problems identified at the tpc
5429736 the committee will continue to review the decisions that led to proenza being pulled out of the center and will watch carefully as a search for a new leader unfolds
5429737 i think factors such as a costly war mounted on the basis of fabricated threats

5429739 about the dismantlement of important weapons installations and the export of dangerous materials to foreign states
5429740 officials of the commission and the international atomic energy agency have repeatedly called on the iraqi government to report on what it knows of the fate of the thousands of pieces of monitored equipment and stockpiles of monitored chemicals and materials
5429741 it appeared that a highly organized operation had pinpointed specific plants in search of valuable equipment some of which could be used for both military and civilian applications and carted the machinery away

5429749 the storms not a concern it just doesnt look like its going to do a lot of damage
5429750 i think its a good use of resources it doesnt put any officers in danger which is a good thing
5429751 you can sit at a computer and find exactly where a suspect goes
5429752 law enforcement has a legitimate right to try to solve crimes and track suspects provided that there are protections so that the innocent are not improperly snooped upon
5429753 our main point with this is that before installing a gps tracking device secretly on someones vehicle a judicial officer should make the decision about how much evidence is good enough how long the tracking can be for and the parameters of the tracking
5429754 i want to point out its very easy to get a warrant if the police have a good reason it doesnt take a long time and if there is a real reason the warrant will be granted
5429755 its a lot more like a police officer tagging along inside your car an invisible police officer inside your car
5429756 the question always comes down to how much are we willing to give up in freedom and privacy for how much marginal increase in our security

5429765 we are already seeing the effects of strong customer relationships in the voting a number of vendors and resellers have evidently courted their customers to vote for them in the awards with impressive levels of participation as a result
5429766 in last years awards those software vendors and resellers that were confident enough to encourage their customers to vote performed the best and rightly so any company with such strong relationships with their customer base deserves to lead the field in the software satisfaction awards
5429767 this year we are already seeing the effects of strong customer relationships in the voting a number of vendors and resellers have evidently courted their customers to vote for them in the awards with impressive levels of participation as a result
5429768 on the other hand some firms in the 2008 awards are showing relatively little voting activity and as the awards are based on the views of genuine end users these firms will struggle to make the cut for the shortlist theres still time though and any firm falling short of the required number of votes will need to get their message out there and quickly
5429769 previous research has demonstrated that many employers hold negative stereotypes about obese workers and those beliefs contribute to discrimination against overweight workers at virtually every stage of the employment process from hiring to promotion to firing
5429770 this study goes a step further by examining whether there is empirical support for these commonly held negative stereotypes are they based on fact or fiction our results suggest that the answer is fiction
5429771 china is unlikely to follow suit as long as the yuans exchange rate is stable against the dollar the chinese central bank will be forced to sell dollars once the yuan appreciated dramatically which might lead to a mass depreciation of the dollar
5429772 foreign ownership of domestic american treasury notes may tilt sino american relations awry in a world where multinational companies are moving every day into the chinese sphere of manufacturing and business reduced leverage at home and putting america in hock to the chinese may not have a rosy ending china may ultimately call the shots during diplomacy and foriegn policy due to acknowledgement of business investment in china and ownership of bonds and bills backed by the american government in chinese hands

5429776 one of the surprising things weve seen so far is in the devices
5429777 the t mobile sidekick is the most popular device we think its due to the fans and that the band uses the sidekick as well we had expected a more even distribution between devices
5429778 these are the early adopters they need to understand more about their mobile users
5429779 the standards in the mobile world are not as advanced as they are in the web world companies need to understand what type of phone people are using what carrier they have and ultimately who it is
5429780 if the phone companies are going to reveal the users name theres some work that has to be done

5429786 the films that disappointed me on that moviegoing day were iron man and the dark knight the first seemed to me an ordinary comic book movie endowed with verve by robert downey jr s performance while hes thought of as a versatile actor downey also has a star persona the guy whos wound a few turns too tight putting up a good front with rapid fire patter see home for the holidays wonder boys kiss kiss bang bang zodiac downeys cynical chatterbox makes iron man watchable when hes not onscreen we get excelsior christopher nolan showed himself a clever director in memento and a promising one in the prestige so how did he manage to make the dark knight such a portentously hollow movie apart from enjoying seeing hong kong in imax i was struck by the repetition of gimmicky situations disguises hostage taking ticking bombs characters dangling over a skyscraper abyss whos dead really once and for all the fights and chases were as unintelligible as most such sequences are nowadays and the usual roaming camera formulas were applied without much variety shoot lots of singles track slowly in on everybody whos speaking spin a circle around characters now and then and transition to a new scene with a quick airborne shot of a cityscape like jim emerson i thought that everything hurtled along at the same aggressive pace if i want an arch criminal caper aiming for shock emotional distress and political comment ill take benny chans new police story

5429791 this paperback is very interesting but i find it will never replace a hardcover book it makes a very poor doorstop
5429792 theres something going on that i cant explain right now
5429793 the more relevant the message to the recipients interests the more likely it will rise above the other messages

5429795 today giant automobile makers as well as start ups like silicon valleys tesla motors are struggling with life cycle performance and the cost limitations of battery technology tesla for example has been delayed several times by transmission related issues and now says it plans to deliver its first models next year
5429796 life cycle performance and the cost limitations of battery technology
5429797 problems with teslas battery pack will affect th nk as well reducing production this year from a planned 200 300 cars to around 70
5429798 over 200 also added to the speculation that different batteries may be under consideration
5429799 therefor the delivery of the tesla roadster has geopolitical and world economic implications
5429800 whoa boys these are all good ideas but lets take a deep breath and work on one thing at a time
5429801 i also think the media should do their homework about the companies that they are covering
5429802 there are also issues of safety with existing lithium ion batteries that have become unstable under extreme temperatures
5429803 we deliberately chose lithium ion cells with a slightly lower capacity than the largest cells available because these smaller and more mature cells have better long term durability and higher tolerance for abuse
5429804 there are also issues of safety with existing lithium ion batteries that have become unstable under extreme temperatures
5429805 i always thought the delay was mainly due to transmission especially after tesla changed suppliers im no engineer but i imagine it must be pretty difficult to make a smooth reliable change with no clutch and 13 000 revs on the clock in first gear
5429806 if the transmission uses a clutch for shifts what do you do to engage disengage the clutch
5429807 im in the 2 e motor camp not that this is feasible for 1st generation roadster at this point
5429808 exact reasons why tesla motors decided to use two speed transmission are not known at least to me use of that transmission allows maximum traction limited acceleration to sustain under largest fraction of emotor power this is first gear but in that case second gear is needed to get maximum speed
5429809 i cant think of any benefits about using to emotors
5429810 but better still is a no transmission single motor with lower rpm and higher torque to eliminate the transmission you need high current now we are back to the battery pack
5429811 was delaying production reportedly because of problems with the battery technology
5429812 tesla has had its struggles it originally said it would have cars for sale by mid 2007 but it recently said that it was delaying production reportedly because of problems with the battery technology until the first quarter of 2008 when it will sell its first 50 cars the company said it would have 600 more cars ready by the end of next year
5429813 i thought you were too worried about there being a bomb on the plane
5429814 well yes the chance of there being a bomb on the plane was still too high for my comfort level however the chance of there being two bombs on the same plane is really vanishingly unlikely and ive decided that thats a level of risk im willing to deal with so now i simply carry my own bomb
5429815 the primary cause of our delay has been and continues to be issues with durability and reliability of the transmission
5429816 the result is that tesla has collected deposits from 600 customers which amounts to a 30 million interest free loan of course teslas customers might have judged the car cool enough with only a single speed transmission or uncomfortable seats or lame headlights
5429817 tesla officials are now busy gearing up for another milestone letting top automotive magazine representatives test drive the roadster on bay area roads next week
5429818 ive been training my ass off for 4 months and im not improving maybe this just isnt working
5429819 i have noticed that the women who make it in these boys clubs have a few things in common the main thing is that almost all of us were promoted and supported by men the men we worked for and with felt comfortable around us we learned to adopt some of the male traits that make men so successful and in doing so we reminded the men of the thing they admire most themselves

5429828 i can only imagine what would happen if the tesla had a bluetooth interface
5429829 a reasonable person could expect such a situation to occur
5429830 the tesla sedan will have the electric motor and batteries up front sending power down the rear wheels two powertrain options are expected to be on offer the smaller featuring a range of 200 miles and a more powerful version with a 300 mile range unlike the roadster with a lotus built aluminum structure the sedan is expected to be made of steel tesla figures on building 10 000 20 000 sedans each year and will be sold globally
5429831 that surprises me if they do what it says to have the motor up front with rear wheel drive drive shafts hurt efficiency cut into cabin space and are a maintenance item i would have thought the pem could go up front but still have the electric motor in the back between the rear wheels
5429832 the tesla sedan will have the electric motor and batteries up front sending power down the rear wheels
5429833 right it makes a lot more sense if you have a gasoline engine but remember the size of our motor i mean the size of our motor its about 10 or 12 inches in diameter and 12 to 14 inches in length and thats it so you know we can package it anywhere in the car front or back without it being a packaging issue its a different problem the neat thing about whitestar not being based on somebody elses chassis is we can architect the vehicle to optimize it as an electric car instead of trying to cram batteries into an architectural designed for gasoline powered car
5429834 that surprises me if they do what it says to have the motor up front with rear wheel drive drive shafts hurt efficiency cut into cabin space and are a maintenance item i would have thought the pem could go up front but still have the electric motor in the back between the rear wheels

5429837 why do you have to come all the way here to connect my phone cant they just push a button on a computer somewhere
5429838 well they do that but someone needs to make the physical connection
5429839 the last tenants had a phone with telstra cant you just say
5429840 he is actually better i was going to fetch the doctor to inform him that richard is lucid and aware of what is going on
5429841 that is great news aoife i would let you go find the doctor but i would like a few minutes of your time there is something we need to discuss
5429842 it is the annulment writ richard had gone to get the day this all happened
5429843 this is why he was so upset it makes sense now poor richard i am going to put this away and not think about it until he is fully healed
5429844 there is actually one more thing we need to talk about aoife come sit down
5429845 when richard was young about 16 he had met a girl who was lets just say not of our social standing she was a farmers daughter and to put it bluntly she became pregnant
5429846 needless to say our father was in a fit of rage and forbid him to see her again
5429847 no but he has taken care of him throughout the years
5429848 his name is gilbert and he is 16 years old
5429849 no he thought it was best he didnt want to interfere in the life his mother had made for him
5429850 well he had his reasons anyway last week when i first saw him he asked me if i would find him and bring him here just in case an heir would be needed
