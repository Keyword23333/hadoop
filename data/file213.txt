2130001 we will have to wait and see what happens it is a question of waiting a bit more and then we will see how things turn out
2130002 all i can say about that is that i know nothing about it either we have a list of forwards and we are working on that not on what journalists or agents are saying
2130003 large numbers of these people really seem to think that an obama election would benefit them hugely
2130004 will be a clear signal for millions of our people
2130005 obama is a visual aid for white americans who just dont get it yet that we have lost control of our country and unless we get it back we are heading for complete annihilation as a people
2130006 it doesnt really matter if obama wins the election or mccain wins the election
2130007 neither of them are going to try to fight to preserve the white race or heritage
2130008 those were the good old days for straight white males but for everyone else it was a pretty raw deal
2130009 the revolution if you will in 1776 brought the 13 colonies together against the king and the same thing can happen now against with the 50 states
2130010 see richard doesnt really mean what he says its popular for him to say it thats the way he makes a living
2130011 same as some more of our black revolutionaries who make a living off of keeping things emotional

2130028 good people are caught up in this system and ive given some examples of the places that i think shes caught up in it
2130029 and i also secondly think that she continues to defend it and i dont think you can bring up the change this country needs if you defend a corrupt system that doesnt work
2130030 the closer we get to the election and the more people move past celebrity and to the issues such as honesty integrity and who can actually bring about change i think they are going to pay very close attention to those questions

2130069 more often than not the obama campaign is discussed as the home team
2130070 i dont think its such a bad thing if for 15 minutes you take off your reporter hat and respond to obama as a human being at an event where youre surrounded by people of color and youre here for a united cause
2130071 aim of new unity initiative is more diversity in top media management
2130072 with more than 50 percent of the population projected to be people of color in less than a generation
2130073 the nations news organizations continue to generate dismal diversity numbers year after year ten by 2010 is a significant step in the right direction
2130074 with an event like the olympics you cant allow for stuttering especially during crucial moments like a goal its a black eye on the branding of the broadcaster too
2130075 it is easier to pre populate a network with one item
2130076 first generation networks placed tens of thousands of servers with one item to serve it up but a million separate files wanting to be seen by a million different users is a bigger challenge
2130077 nbc significantly increased the specifications for systems availability this time around given the extensive plans for video streaming
2130078 we do not expect the streaming service to have any large scale impact on the network

2130080 its wonderful news it will help fight attrition and traffic blues lower costs and allow many more people to join the workforce its a great move but i need to look into details
2130081 this could be the game changer for india and the industry it could make attrition problems history however the devil is in the details and we need to see the terms and conditions
2130082 the industry has been asking for this for long it would allow those who are home bound like differently abled people and women to work in the bpo industry and earn too
2130083 clients have a whole host of security concerns and access to information to employees is allowed in a tightly controlled environment security concerns reduce the lure of work from home and its no longer a viable option for us
2130084 we can provide the same data privacy controls at home electronically
2130085 agents could call their companies and be routed to the international customer on a secure line similarly inbound calls could be received at the companys office and then directed to the agent sitting at home

2130088 with more agriculture workers joining the union and establishing collective agreements
2130089 it encourages others to seek the legal representation to deal with systemic problems with sawp and wages arent the only issue so are fundamental workers rights
2130090 we understand that farms have fiscal realities and this is not a campaign to put farmers out of business certainly hard work deserves fair pay but for many of these workers whats as important is being recalled each season based on seniority and a grievance procedure that protects them from being arbitrarily repatriated if they raise any workplace issues
2130091 our security is in a bad shape with our intelligence in a defensive mode
2130092 well continue to see more such attacks if something is not done fast

2130104 the net effect is that they are more ambitious when it comes to money
2130105 the raw talent is a primary factor but i think the experience somebody gets at their college plays a part
2130106 the network of people you meet and the kinds of experiences you have in and out of the classrooms helps form who you are and what you become
2130107 the happiest and richest people look for schools to help them develop their talents in whatever field that owns their soul

2130135 we all have our personal opinion about freddie and his efforts for this club
2130136 he got a lot of criticism last year after what happened in the game at birmingham
2130137 but until then everyone said he was a fantastic captain so i think he deserves another go to show his commitment and then we will see where we stand at the end of the season
2130138 he acknowledged that he made some mistakes and he has learnt from it
2130139 he is an important player in the team and he plays in a position where it is easy to be the captain
2130140 some of the other players who could be captain are still a bit young

2130153 children with simple febrile seizures had a risk of death similar to the background population whereas those with complex febrile seizures febrile seizures triggered by a temperature below 39 degrees c and febrile seizures occurring before 12 months of age had a twofold higher mortality lasting for about two years the excess mortality was at least partly due to pre existing neurological abnormalities and subsequent epilepsy parents should be reassured that death after febrile seizures is very rare even in high risk children
2130154 the latest data show the slowdown in uk economic activity gathering pace and business and consumer confidence falling further
2130155 however with inflation heading higher in the next couple of months the bank is right to leave rates on hold for the time being
2130156 the mpc continues to be pulled in opposing directions by rising inflation and slowing growth however the balance of risk appears to be shifting more rapidly a cut in interest rates may be needed sooner rather than later to prevent the economy from drifting towards recession
2130157 we are not surprised that rates remained at 5 we feel that with inflation rising over the next few months possibly to up to 5 in the autumn the mpc was unable to give the economy any relief via lower rates but we are happy it had resisted the temptation to raise rates

2130175 she definitely brings a fun side out of anakin i think they have such a great relationship
2130176 ahsoka is very eager to prove herself and i dont think she would allow anakin not to accept her
2130177 i was hoping id never have to lay eyes on this dustball again
2130178 with this movie and also the ongoing series were going to see the banter between obi wan and anakin were going to see them as comrades as buddies
2130179 it is reminiscent of some of the original star wars its got that comic relief in it and has kind of that old school feeling
2130180 that was the impetus of that this whole period of time we could run around in
2130181 it was a script submitted to me about nine years ago
2130182 at the time it was about a bunch of teenagers who worked in a mall which we thought was an absolutely great concept
2130183 we noticed how to add more and more music and still keep the story moving forward it felt like you got to a certain part of the script and you just went music when i started watching every musical i could trying to understand why i liked them so much i realized music didnt stop the story and added depth to the characters
2130184 a lot of the other cast members had been involved with the project for months doing very intensive auditions
2130185 i got really lucky i had only two auditions in the space of a week then a week later we were ready to shoot

2130187 theres been a lot more of it over the past few years which is really fabulous

2130202 its just that what you do it doesnt have as important a place in the lives of people now
2130203 the world is in a really tough spot and you can make people laugh and do a tv show and thats important to them but
2130204 how long does that last that effect how long do you take their mind off other things and the second question becomes should you be taking their mind off other things
2130205 i know this sounds like im being handy but its handy and true at the same time which works quite well the networks have to do it clean i love the sopranos i love everything on the cable stations where its much more hard edged salty more adult the networks we dont have that luxury you cant go blue youve got to keep it clean thats harder to do the fact that we have a smart show with nothing that caustic or harsh is a miracle to talk about what i want to do to condoleezza rice sexually without saying something really really anatomical that takes a lot of doing

2130210 its a big plus point that adebayor has decided to stay at the club hes a big player for us so im pleased hes committed himself to the club
2130211 he worked his socks off against real madrid pre season but hes got to do that every game now
2130212 the fans have to see that hes got the desire and wants to play in an arsenal shirt
2130213 im sure if he works hard and scores a few goals the fans will be singing his name again

2130242 the 60 percent protective effect against hiv acquisition over the first 24 months of the study we now find to be sustained and possibly strengthened to approximately 65 percent over three and a half years of follow up

2130244 teaching a large first year course at a british university i am fed up with correcting my students atrocious spelling
2130245 instead of complaining about the state of the education system as we correct the same mistakes year after year ive got a better idea
2130246 university teachers should simply accept as variant spelling those words our students most commonly misspell
2130247 we spell the word february the way we do only because it is taken from the latin word februa the roman festival of purification
2130248 similarly the correct spelling of the word wednesday comes from the old english wodnes daeg or wodens day but why should we still pay homage today to a pagan god or a roman festival of purification
2130249 there are enormous advantages in having a coherent system of spelling
2130250 it makes it easier to communicate maybe during a learning phase there is some scope for error but i would hope that by the time people get to university they have learnt to spell

2130261 but if it happens im extremely happy and excited for murray i think he deserves another chance to be a head coach in the nhl
2130262 a year ago going back down to the phantoms as head coach was a good opportunity for me to get experience and show i could be a head coach
2130263 now getting a chance to go back to the nhl especially with the flyers is a good opportunity for me too
2130264 it wasnt something that i was planning on when it happened this late in the summer when paul called it was an opportunity that presented itself that i couldnt let go by there are so many people in the organization that ive worked with coached and played with that there were too many signs pointing to it being a good thing

2130274 what they the coalition have done is absolutely no service to democracy

2130277 this decision was taken in haste they are playing with fire
2130278 none of the treatments studied had any significant benefit over no treatment at all

2130311 clearly if a taser is used as an alternative to shooting someone dead then that is one thing
2130312 if on the other hand a taser was used to repeatedly fire into someone for the purpose of eliciting information then obviously that is a different situation

2130348 all too often companies set out on an executive search without even realizing what theyre looking for
2130349 dont make this mistake outline a list of metrics that pinpoint the skills and qualifications needed and match those up to applicants recruited software that is specialized in the recruitment process is ideal for helping you to effectively identify the ideal job candidate
2130350 especially in larger enterprises where the corporation is inundated with employment applications having an efficient software solution that can sit between your website and your human resources database is the most effective strategy
2130351 while these active pursuit techniques are crucial to any successful employee recruiting effort it should also be noted that the company must make sure to brand itself as a good place to work

2130543 das wird immer eng mit seinem namen verbunden bleiben aber auch bei der euro 2008 hatte er einen genauso gro en anteil an unserem erfolg
2130544 er hat viel f r den deutschen fu ball geleistet und war f r mich stets ein wichtiger ansprechpartner

2130548 we just have to have a better record than them after 162 games
2130549 it doesnt matter who youre playing if theyre in the way weve got to beat them if theyre not in the way weve got to beat the team thats in front of us and not worry about them the best record is going to get you to the playoffs regardless of who you beat
2130550 were really going to have to step it up a notch
2130551 they are in our division and because theyre the ones nipping at our heels as it goes on though we do play a lot of games against other teams and i think thats when weve really been able to go out there and win i think if you can get away with it its great
2130552 but when it really comes down to it in september were really going to have to win those games against the division rivals

2130560 however there are a couple of things with this team that you get
2130561 thats not what our team does here so its a little bit twofold there
2130562 i mentioned yesterday that weve cut obviously the number of plays down from what we have installed in training camp here just so the guys can get out there and function in particular the young guys
2130563 they can get out there and function and theyre not worried about what the play is
2130564 i think hes done a good job with it but again well get to see him against different people here well see how he does
2130565 im going to have a lot of fun out there coming out and starting
2130566 im going to try and showcase my talent and let the coaches know im ready im going to show them what i got
2130567 i said this early in camp that there are going to be certain guys that make this football team because of special teams if everything is equal or close to and youre excelling on special teams then youre going to be the guy that makes this club

2130631 elbows were raised i dont know if they were trying to make us injured for the olympic games
2130632 i dont know when australia and the u s have ever met and it has not been physical
2130633 i dont think we left the game feeling like it was any more physical than when we played russia or latvia
2130634 it got very physical but it certainly was not one sided
2130635 to minimize the excessive use by contractors of subcontractors or tiers of subcontractors to perform the principal work of the contract
2130636 with this acquisition we have extended our capacity to serve the department of homeland security and expanded our contract portfolio significantly
2130637 we view the protest including the argument regarding the scope of the services to be performed as challenging tsas actions pursuant to the oct 18 solicitation and as such outside our jurisdiction
2130638 we feel theres a serious intention by the american forces for a withdrawal timetable at the very least
2130639 it should not be considered an end to the mehdi army but its a halfway step to dissolving the mehdi army if the u s began to implement a withdrawal timetable we shall complete the path to dissolution
2130640 it is a good step to repair our mistakes especially sectarianism and sectarian killings we are very sorry about these sectarian killings because some parties supported this violence for their own advantage
2130641 to renounce violence and participate peacefully in the iraqi political process
2130642 as of last night the schedule was one of the issues being discussed between the two sides there is no agreement yet but this is what the iraqis are asking for
2130643 if we find this does not happen and the u s forces change their stance over the timetable we can change direction also
2130644 this will not mean ending the ceasefire it will depend on whats going on the ground
2130645 today the iraqi oil ministry celebrates a return to work by iraqi oil exploration teams after 20 years of interruption
2130646 the ministry has begun to build new refineries in the country in the provinces of dhiqar kirkuk karbala and misan while renovating other refineries in baghdad basra and diwaniyah
2130647 crude was a safe haven at a time of declining stocks and a declining dollar and now the dollar is going back up so people are less interested in a safe haven
2130648 oil is following the euro dollar and thats keeping pressure to the downside
2130649 there are worries about the economic situation with expectations of flat demand
2130650 in the past six olympic games there had been an average 19 12 per cent increase in the hosting countries stock indexes in the six months following the games
2130651 not all the gold in the olympics is going to be made by the athletes savvy investors are going to make some too
2130652 what i am telling the readers of my newsletter is that i think we may see a bigger pop than what has been historically normal because it is starting from a depressed starting point
2130653 sometimes they get so pessimistic they drive things down to unrealistically low prices which is pretty much where we are now in china
2130654 it causes a focus on the host country and a lot of people who maybe had not considered that host countrys economy and opportunities for investment all of a sudden will pay more attention
2130655 the infrastructure construction system establishment and environmental protection among others for the olympics gave a lasting boost to the hosting countries economy
2130656 therefore although gross domestic product growth in those hosting countries showed a certain degree of slowdown generally speaking the hosting countrys economy maintained a relatively high speed of growth

2130662 weve harped and harped on the lack of willing investors to provide capital to the juniors
2130663 however we believe its only a matter of time until investors return to the junior mining sector
2130664 while investors should not get more bearish at this point we are not advising to rush in and buy yet either
2130665 a more probable scenario for the near term could be that select sectors and countries have seen their lows but are unable to rally much
2130666 in the interim other sectors and countries where fundamentals are bearish could witness new lows in share prices
2130667 our airline has achieved great success in colombia after only eight months of operation and we are now embarking on our second stage of expansion we are delighted with the jetstream 41 the aircraft has performed exceptionally and has adapted well to the countrys topographical conditions an added benefit we have enjoyed has been the aircrafts fuel efficiency

2130670 mispronunciation is more than a challenge its also a danger
2130671 if you pronounce it wrong you may end up with the wrong drug
2130672 its just going to get worse with increases in the number of drugs and in the number of unfamiliar names
2130673 as far as pronunciation of words my experience is that its pretty much all over the place
2130674 even if you were pronouncing something correctly if you had a really deep southern drawl its not going to sound the same or if you come in with an english accent or a french accent or a texas accent you may be pronouncing it correctly but its not going to sound the same
2130675 i thought this guys just mispronouncing this terribly and hes the speaker but he actually studied under the guy who discovered the drug
2130676 most industrial countries are showing symptoms of over heating in the housing market
2130677 one simply cannot ignore the number of indicators that are now simultaneously exhibiting marked deviations
2130678 weve had a 30 year leveraging up of america ending in an unchecked orgy
2130679 the final straw was the feds hopelessly slow tightening from 2004 onwards there was no excuse for the interest rates of 1pc and then they went through this ludicrous metronome dance of quarter point hikes
2130680 by making banks raise capital against their balance sheets it gave them a strong incentive to move off balance sheets
2130681 to get inflation down to 2 and keep it there required the very high real interest rates in force in the eighties to purge the inflationary excesses of the seventies to be maintained throughout the nineties this made the western economies moribund and drove nominal interest rates ever lower
2130682 democracy can be flexible and more speedily flexible in a better direction than the dictatorships
2130683 rating agencies are supposed to get their ratings somewhat close to reality and didnt
2130684 failure has been in technical areas of risk management and bond rating
2130685 the federal reserve banks are one of the most corrupt institutions the world has ever seen there is not a man within the sound of my voice who does not know that this nation is run by the international bankers
2130686 the few who understand the system will either be so interested in its profits or so dependent on its favors that there will be no opposition from either class
2130687 to attempt to portray the financial institutions as poor children led astray by the wicked actions of the various governments is novel but unconvincing surely they should have been able to act as organisations with some sense of self preservation yet all we got was mindless pocket lining as chaotic amp self serving as to quote p j orourke chimps at a salad bar if people have lost faith in financial institutions its because theyve behaved like fools and we apparently are to bail them out for it
2130688 we must blame capitalism for this fiasco otherwise it wont learn and it will go on practising without moral hazard in the future
2130689 this is not one of aeps brightest columns it was financial capital itself that relentlessly called for and got government deregulation this allowed financiers to take virtually any risk and they did and now we must pay
2130690 i think youve missed aeps point somewhat although the banks should nmot have done what they did they were pushed into by the fed

2130695 it derives from the milton friedman doctrine that the slumps can always be avoided by monetary stimulus loutrance to the utmost if only life were so simple
2130696 interest rates were being held too low for safety in most of the worlds mature economies
2130697 one cannot ignore the number of indicators that are now simultaneously exhibiting marked deviations
2130698 with just about everyone in the country knowing someone who has been affected most people will be that much more conservative about what credit they take on that is they will stop treating cheap credit as a kind of no lose public welfare system and start treating credit with the respect it deserves
2130699 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create deposits and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create deposits
2130700 well any kind of socialism is of course revolting and grossly immoral but you need to remember capitalism is at heart hypocrital socialism is fine so long as it sells in my view thing would be so much better if the usa nuked irans religious cities just get on with it

2130718 there must be clearly a distinction between the fog and pollution
2130719 the fog you see is based on the basis of humidity and heat it does not mean this fog is the same as pollution there can be pollution but the fog is not necessarily pollution
2130720 they do not have the same confidence they once had can we return sport to its very essence to the fair play concept we must if we do not then part of the world as weve known it for all of our lives is going to leave us

2130728 we created a lot of chances and we were dangerous in the final third
2130729 were thrilled to welcome these two beautiful animals to our family at the baghdad zoo
2130730 the conservartors centre is proud to contribute these tigers toward the restoration of the baghdad zoo and the important education work it will engage in over the next decade
2130731 after 13 days of the us occupation we found the animals in miserable conditions
2130732 only a few of the bigger animals were still alive such as four lions and three bears
2130733 we have forgotten this matter as it is in the past and the us apologised
2130734 we did not use to come here much but after we heard that there are new animals we wanted to look around especially for our kids
2130735 we really like the tigers and we hope they will bring more
2130736 this is a good day for the tigers the zoo and the people of iraq
2130737 our heart goes out to the two tigers who had to endure the long trip to iraq and a dangerous future at the baghdad zoo
2130738 these tigers will be caged helpless and completely dependent on humans to survive in an area where many people live in fear and are still without access to basic necessities
2130739 we have the utmost concern for the well being of the tigers
2130740 we have full confidence that the baghdad zoo has the staff and facilities to care for them long into the future

2130748 this is a broader and more important collection of degenerative diseases for which there are no good treatments and more importantly no good animal models
2130749 the cells will allow researchers access for the first time to cell types of interest to watch the disease progress in a dish to watch what goes right or wrong well see in the years ahead that this opens the door to a new way of treating degenerative disease
2130750 that is where all of the science will go on over the next many many years
2130751 even though the ips methodology gives us a facile way for making disease specific lines it does not eliminate the value or need for continuing to study human embryonic stem cells
2130752 those are really the gold standard for pluripotent stem cell types they have no genetic modifications and at least for the foreseeable future and i would argue beyond that are going to be extremely valuable tools human embryonic stem cells allow you to ask questions that we never can ask with ips cells
2130753 whether or not were going to be able to figure out how to do it without viruses so we can use the cells therapeutically is as of today an unanswered question
2130754 im confident were going to get there and that within the next year or two we will have several strategies for reprogramming cells without viruses and when that happens we may have cells in our hands that may be valuable for cell replacement therapy
2130755 in these complex genetic diseases were so ignorant at the moment we dont even know if patients who get type 1 diabetes all get it the same way there could be 50 different ways to get type 1 diabetes

2130814 i was surprised at the transition how different it was from wednesday to today
2130815 i thought it would be a little firmer and a little faster but it got a lot firmer and a lot faster thats going to make it play difficult on the weekend unless we get some rain

2130822 if eric had been openly gay he would never have been allowed in the military
2130823 i think that eric coming out showed how ineffective dont ask dont tell is
2130824 being in the military is hard enough without having a sound bite making life more complicated in ways that people dont realize it can and has been used as a weapon for personal vendettas
2130825 but it ended up being used and abused as a political tool
2130826 for instance the military has what they call moral waivers in which people convicted of felonies can have these crimes forgiven for enlistment purposes the crimes include manslaughter arson kidnapping and rape but they will keep you out if you say you are gay or a lesbian it makes no sense a vast array of talent that the military could use would become available if people were accepted as who they are
2130827 there is a huge shortage of people who can do what i do and i would love to go and do it
2130828 but once discharged thats it under the current policy it makes you feel helpless
2130829 thats once of the reasons i now work in activism
2130830 that shows how arbitrarily the rules are now enforced by the military
2130831 he lived his life in the open and nobody cared he did his job and got out
2130832 and thats something that the policy doesnt take into consideration people are more educated more tolerant and when a gay man is in combat his chances of being discharged dramatically shrink the movie shows this discharges are shrinking the numbers bear this out
2130833 this movie was funded in part by pbs and is scheduled to be broadcast next year
2130834 i hope mainstream exposure will show how complicated dont ask dont tell makes life for a soldier who is out there willing and ready to give his or her life if necessary
2130835 if people walk away with an understanding of what this policy is what it does and what it has done then i think the world will be a better place
2130836 weve come to see pylons role in the bigger picture but to be honest we have never really felt like we were really a part of the whole show business thing and still dont so nothing has really changed
2130837 we treated the entire music industry with detached indifference we were more like these art purist types who didnt want our specific palette of ideas and sounds to morph into something beyond the discipline of what we did
2130838 to translate we were tourists who knew we werent there to stay
2130839 i honestly cant tell you how we did it outside of michael and i took these ideas and played them for hours
2130840 our binge rehearsals drove our future drummer curtis he lived upstairs from where we rehearsed so crazy that he finally brought some drums down to help us move on then vanessa just dropped in
2130841 it was like oops we made a 45 single oops we made an album oops were in england hey were broke oops its not fun anymore lets stop so we did 100 per cent we never thought that what we had done made a difference
2130842 if someone didnt have sufficient indoctrination into what we did they werent gonna get it and if they didnt get it well i have heard boos
2130843 the other side of that is when we did open for like minded bands talking heads gang of four pil the experience was great but it didnt happen much
2130844 you never know when you are doing it if you are having an influence or not
2130845 there was a time when i would occasionally look back and think what if but im over that this time around its about having fun making music with each other
2130846 at first we didnt know whether to laugh or cry
2130847 but it came back pretty quickly and is extremely faithful to the way we have always played
2130848 i think we understand that pylon has been in remission for so much of its life that we tend to live more in peoples memory so we cant screw it up now
2130849 this music isnt just ours it belongs to everybody who loves it
2130850 but were letting the cliff have a life of its own
2130851 i looked to the land to the placement of the cliff our siting things we cant do anything about to tell us what to do
2130852 is to watch a tree or shrub or perennial grow from a young transplant to cultivate and nurture it
2130853 we are eager to build our boeing fleet with these additional 737s and 767s to meet continued demand for air travel in our region
2130854 todays order is yet another step forward in our strong relationship with boeing we look forward to operating the 787 and benefiting from its advanced performance features however the 767 300er is the economical and logical choice to fulfill our interim capacity targets
2130855 boeing and british airways have a relationship that stretches back over the last 50 years and this order is a reaffirmation of this ongoing partnership
2130856 the 777 300er offers exceptional fuel economy and environmental credentials and will integrate seamlessly into british airways existing twin aisle fleet
2130857 in addition our key partner gecas continues to demonstrate confidence in the 777 with the 777s gecas has ordered in the last two years it has created five new 777 customers three of the five new customers have subsequently purchased new 777s directly from boeing

2130859 prior studies have looked at atrial fibrillation in young and middle aged and generally healthy people
2130860 they found that for example marathon runners have a higher risk of atrial fibrillation but the vast majority of atrial fibrillation occurs later in life after 65 about one in five people develops atrial fibrillation over 10 years
2130861 no one has looked at exercise and atrial fibrillation in these older people
2130862 we found that light to moderate exercise such as walking 10 blocks a week was associated with a lower incidence of atrial fibrillation
2130863 we have enrolled patients who have atrial fibrillation already to see whether exercise improves their quality of life
2130864 preliminary data appears to be that they feel better and function better
2130865 there are additional strong reasons for the public to focus on exercise
2130866 the practice of wearing no clothes in a vacation camp or other leisure activities nudism
2130867 for anyone considering a trip to this years blizzcon october 10 11 in anaheim california tickets will go on sale worldwide on monday august 11 for 100 each through our website blizzcon is a celebration of the communities surrounding all of our games and features discussion panels hands on play contests tournaments and more we look forward to meeting some of you there
2130868 it had received a preliminary approach from a third party which it is considering this approach is at a very early stage and there can be no certainty that it will lead to an offer being made for the company
2130869 we knew that there were downside risks and those risks are materialising
2130870 they have cut out all reference to moderate ongoing growth and no longer seem sure that the economy will recover even in the fourth quarter i detect meaningful concern
2130871 the july rate rise looks like a policy mistake in need of being urgently reversed
2130872 theres not much left once you take out germanys staggering export growth each time theres a global shock european policy makers say that they are relatively immune and each time that turns out not be the case
2130873 the data has been dreadful but the ecb has surprised us before they are monetarists after all
2130874 josh were in the midst of data analysis but i
2130875 interesting reactions can you share here or point me in the

2130883 the cdc is committed to ensuring that its resources are going to the populations hardest hit by the epidemic
2130884 its often more politically viable to fund programs for women and children and youth
2130885 at a minimum we need to be matching percentages to where the epidemic is
2130886 something happening in artists studios a shift of emphasis from surface to depth and a shift of mood from mania to melancholy shrugging off the allures of the money hypnotized market and the spectacle bedizened biennials circuit
2130887 a bruptly once settled views and values have unsettled themselves and stalk the mind
2130888 what we want now is a major artist a who will manifest durable truths at the core of inevitable hypes and hyperboles if none such appears that will be a valuable datum it will help us adjust to the happenstance that once and finally our particular civilization is spent
2130889 there is some sort of harmony it is the harmony of overwhelming and collective murder
2130890 an inner untidiness too vast to be tamed by ordinary secular means
2130891 the sovereignty issue is very big for the iraqis and we understand that but we are losing patience
2130892 the process needs to get moving and get moving quickly
2130893 this move is meant to offer an incentive for the foreign forces to withdraw
2130894 the special cells of fighters will not strike against foreign forces until the situation becomes clear vis a vis the iraq u s agreement on the presence of american forces here
2130895 mahmud kraydi alias abu hunata considered to be the leader of al qaeda in ramadi was arrested at sharqat in salaheddin province on the basis of intelligence
2130896 postponing the election law will complicate the situation in kirkuk and lead to a struggle between the factions and eventually a civil war may erupt
2130897 the parliament and the government has to work seriously to resolve the situation
2130898 we want to solve the problem not ignite the problem and i came to kirkuk with a message from the which is the message of brotherhood love and invitation for understanding
2130899 if there is a shortcoming in the kurdish performance we are ready to rectify it
2130900 kurds are fed up with the crooked policy of malikis government it is time to bring kirkuk back to its origin kurdistan
2130901 malikis government has to prove its influence by ensuring all iraqi factions are represented in the provincial council and not let some parties control the city
2130902 we have fears about foreign agendas by parties inside and outside kirkuk why have all the parties positions unified against the kurds

2130905 i think the audience will really enjoy him letting loose like that
2130906 but while the mac vs pc debate is always good for ratings
2130907 we may think we live in a fast moving hectic world but statistically our environment moves around us slowly
2130908 apart from the odd speeding car buildings landscape and walls around us all move past us at slow and predictable speeds our brains are constantly building up a statistical picture of the world around and based on experience it is a statistically slow world
2130909 when an object moves quickly be it a football cricket ball or for our ancestors a spear our brains have to interpret the movement rapidly and because our brains draw on experience its often biased by what it already knows the less certain we are about what we see the more we are influenced by the brains statistical assumptions which means in some circumstances we get it wrong
2130910 although it is not surprising that sportsmen who practice a lot build up a better statistical picture in their minds about where a ball might go it is surprising that what should be a vital survival skill is based on such a trial and error learning experience
2130911 capitalizing on natures design is a good way of building artificial visual systems for robots as humans get visual judgments right a lot more often than the best current robot systems further knowing the situations in which humans get it wrong is a useful starting point for the design of assistive devices to help correct those errors before they have serious consequences
2130912 the point of the article was to determine what human genes are critical to or influence west nile virus infection
2130913 theyre interested in identifying the genetic factors that regulate susceptibility to infection with a certain class of viruses and among those viruses are some which are of public health importance
2130914 in theory if you could identify the genetic factors that make cells susceptible to infection you could do something about that to make people less susceptible
2130915 there are some pathways that are important for both viruses
2130916 were testing other viruses and are hopeful that some of these pathways will be important for the common family of viruses and if so will provide special targets for prevention
2130917 is more than anyone can handle on their own im hopeful this will provide a road map for other people to ask these types of questions
2130918 the finding has good potential to provide us with novel targets in humans that can be exploited to intervene in a wide array of viral infections
2130919 just as the eyes are the window to the soul the eyes are also a window into social development
2130920 the earlier we are able to identify children the better it is because early interventions make a difference in optimizing childrens outcomes
2130921 weve always had a sense that children with autism dont make eye contact but this study confirms it in a higher tech way
2130922 if theres a derailment in the process of social engagement
2130923 in reality the only possibility of avoiding such a crunch appears to be if a major recession reduces demand and even then such an outcome may only postpone the problem
2130924 only extreme policy measures could achieve a speedy response and these are usually politically unpopular
2130925 patients may not be learning this information from their health care providers and information regarding is not as well publicized as it could be
2130926 in the context of busy clinic visits it is in some ways efficient for patients to be reminded that physical activity is good for their health in general going through each specific health benefit of physical activity would take considerable time
2130927 sedentary people should first set such moderate achievable goals more benefits could accrue from higher levels and more intense exercise such as jogging running or tennis to some extent more may be better but it is important to note that a little is much better than nothing
2130928 theyre going to push each other and really help make something special
2130929 were gonna be doing one thing and one thing only and thats killing nazis
2130930 in moderately active individuals short durations of stretching seem to temporarily improve flexibility without the detrimental strength losses that have been previously reported
2130931 pre competition stretching became controversial due to what has been reported as decreases in performance however future research still needs to determine how these stretching exercises may impact athletes
2130932 durations of stretching at or less than eight minutes may not significantly alter lower leg strength
2130933 our findings in conjunction with previous studies suggest that for these muscles there may be a threshold of stretching between eight and 10 minutes that would be necessary to decrease muscle strength
2130934 further to recent speculation flying brands ltd confirms that it has received a very preliminary approach from west coast capital this approach is at a very early stage and there can be no certainty that it will lead to an offer being made
2130935 the tough market environment has exerted pressure on our second quarter results
2130936 proven very resilient at a time of equity market crisis
2130937 the main impact on the industry is still on the asset side
2130938 with respect to what we call advertising and consumer promotion our activities are increasing but we are finding better ways more creative ways to get better value for money
2130939 this is an opportunistic move by xstrata which attempts to capitalise on the current volatility in financial and metal markets lonmin will contest this approach vigorously it undervalues lonmins unique business and fails to deliver appropriate value for lonmins shareholders
2130940 we found that the actual incidence of gastrointestinal gi bleeding would make it an uncommon complication
2130941 but when it does arise it appears to be associated with increased death and disability
2130942 one of the key points we want to raise is that people are generally prone to developing medical complications with stroke
2130943 and as part of that larger observation we know that among these complications are gi issues and we feel that this is particularly important because gastrointestinal bleeding is a complication that is potentially modifiable with various treatment strategies
2130944 having a poorer outcome in stroke patients with gastrointestinal bleeding is not surprising at all
2130945 but i dont know based on this kind of a retrospective study if we can tell how preventable this is as there are all sorts of things that the researchers may not be measuring that might affect the results
2130946 we treat all our stroke patients with preventive prophylactic therapy to prevent gi bleeding and our experience is that gi bleeding is a rare event so its really not something we get too concerned about
2130947 and that means that the fact that this study shows an increased risk of death associated with gi bleeding says to me that a gastrointestinal problem is simply a marker for someone who is a lot sicker not an independent factor directly related to the stroke itself
2130948 so i dont think this finding gives us much useful new information
2130949 probably around 2bn id take it up from 24m passengers today to more than 40m by halving landing fees for all
2130950 you could have a second runway for 150m and second terminal for 250m instead of the 4bn taj mahal baas planning and we could bury harry bush the civil aviation authoritys economic regulator under the concrete on the ramp
2130951 while we are heartened that he sees the long term value of stansted airport it is not for sale
2130952 fgf 23 helps regulate serum phosphate levels and we know that among patients with kidney failure elevated phosphate is associated with more rapid progression to renal failure and earlier death
2130953 the results of this study suggest that we need to be concerned about phosphate control even for patients whose serum phosphate levels are normal and that may involve routine screening for fgf 23
2130954 incorporating fgf 23 levels into the management of kidney failure may have its greatest potential for treatment of the millions of patients with early stage dialysis who usually have normal phosphate levels but quite high fgf 23
2130955 routinely monitoring fgf 23 may help determine which patients need to begin therapies that control phosphate levels which may reduce mortality in this very high risk group
2130956 one question we are mulling is the closeness of the vote and whether there is still a significant danger of the committee raising rates especially as our forecasts show cpi inflation at 5pc in september

2130959 more and more retail consumers are going online to shop the endless rows of digital shelves
2130960 in response to our retail partners needs consumer behavior and business efficiencies microsoft is focusing distribution efforts for microsoft money plus software online via download and discontinuing traditional box sales of the software at retail
2130961 microsoft does not see shrink wrapped software going away anytime soon and we are always talking to customers about different ways to price and package our software offerings
2130962 the company is evolving its strategy and product solutions to meet customer demand and optimize business efficiencies
2130963 the traditions grew out of race to a certain extent
2130964 the real problem as i see it is that weve placed god in a box
2130965 the evangelical church in this country doesnt today maintain any consistent tradition
2130966 you always end up speaking disparaging and blissfully ignorant words about the other without regard to whether they are fellow believers
2130967 thats the atmosphere in which many white conservative evangelical churches exist all i need to focus on is me and mine and never mind the poor people out there who havent worked as hard as i do to get what i have
2130968 you belong in that other fellowship only because of your ethniciy color
2130969 heres another item to consider in addition to growing up in a liturgical tradition im also a jazz musician should i leave my preferred musical style outside the church doors because it doesnt fit with the prevailing church culture
2130970 why do black and white christians in the united states worship separately
2130971 how can my congregation reach its community what human resources does my congregation contain that can be directed at the issues the community is facing
2130972 maybe it will require a round of authentic persecution of christians in america before we will learn to focus on the great things we have in common and to ignore the minor differences that currently keep us apart
2130973 we are a predominantly white tertiary educated upper middle class congregation
2130974 carl youre involved in tertiary education its the next step up from
2130975 churches should exactly reflect the race makeup of the community
2130976 but one thing i do forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead i press on
2130977 given that this happened how am i going to respond
2130978 the little man is healthy happy and as loud as his daddy
2130979 this test is another important milestone on the road to putting the aim 120d in the hands of the u s warfighter
2130980 the aim 120d will enable our men and women in uniform to maintain air superiority regardless of the threat
2130981 advanced features offer u s aviators a critical advantage in the beyond visual range fight

2130983 i liked her much better in the bob i thought it was really sophisticated very chic and very trendy
2130984 this whole sort of fashion evolution since becoming mrs tom cruise i think it has taken her time to find her sea legs
2130985 this haircut is clearly a step in the right direction
2130986 where did i go right youre no one in hollywood unless someone wants you dead
2130987 we got a dead person a 250 a week raise i knew i was in the right business
2130988 you take care of everything and get them ready for the day
2130989 how do you take an actor or comedian or a writer and point them in the right direction and go through all that garbage unless you love it and love them and think theyre talented and worth it
2130990 latin america is an important market for executive aviation and labace will be an excellent opportunity for embraer to promote the advances in products and services for this area
2130991 we are very pleased to publicly exhibit the phenom 300 for the first time like we did with the phenom 100 last year
2130992 veterans that were exposed to agent orange during the vietnam war have a twofold higher risk of prostate cancer
2130993 the cancer they get tends to be more aggressive a higher grade and is more likely to spread or have spread at the time that they present to their urologist
2130994 a lot of veterans dont get their care through the va veterans administration
2130995 this message needs to go out to their physicians and their urologist in the private community to know that this is a large risk factor
2130996 i can almost guarantee youre going to find more cases of prostate cancer
2130997 im not saying that there is not possibly some relationship but i dont think that this paper necessarily proves it
2130998 but i think you could pick almost any exposure and increase screening and you are going to find more cases whether or not the agent is responsible for more cases or not
2130999 the finding is provocative but its hard to know how to interpret it unless it can be replicated in other studies
2131000 we have seen good market conditions and the business is benefiting from longer term demographic changes
2131001 the second quarter has seen strong revenue growth across the business our focus on innovation in the attractive growth market segments in each business is delivering excellent results margin improvement across the businesses shows that our earnings improvement programme is working well
2131002 a strong set of results ahead of our expectations and towards the top end of consensus no further downside reported relating to plus and lost sales of 19m in second quarter appear well within original management expectations
2131003 we might all be better off if we used less salt and pepper and focused more on herbs and spices
2131004 ive started putting oregano in my eggs thats not a big change
2131005 at first we thought it was the apples but it soon became clear that it was the cinnamon
2131006 taking cinnamon supplements for the purposes of either improving glucose control or improving cholesterol levels is not supported by the evidence that is currently available
2131007 larger studies may show that supplementation is beneficial but it seems unlikely
2131008 we showed that herbs and spices are powerful sources of antioxidants and anti inflammatory agents
2131009 about a teaspoon of cinnamon for example is plenty to get these beneficial effects
2131010 if you set up a good herb and spice cabinet and season your food liberally you could double or even triple the medicinal value of your meal without increasing the calorie content
2131011 the shortage of vehicles available for lease at the point franchises are being let technical and operational factors and costs and risks in switching or introducing new rolling stock
2131012 we have found that there is active rivalry between roscos for the leasing of new rolling stock at its first lease
2131013 frequently little or no competition to the existing incumbent fleet
2131014 echoed what the conservatives have been saying for years that the governments possessive micro management of the railways is preventing innovation
2131015 what the commission has said vindicates our position the market may not be perfect but the problems arent down to us
2131016 with the end of the stimulus cheques we know consumers are spending more cautiously and we continue to see a pronounced pay cheque cycle at the end of the month

2131020 sen barack obama d ill was the most liberal senator in 2007 according to national journals 27th annual vote ratings the insurgent presidential candidate shifted further to the left last year in the run up to the primaries after ranking as the 16th and 10th most liberal during his first two years in the senate sen hillary rodham clinton d n y the other front runner in the democratic presidential race also shifted to the left last year she ranked as the 16th most liberal senator in the 2007 ratings a computer assisted analysis that used 99 key senate votes selected by nj reporters and editors to place every senator on a liberal to conservative scale in each of three issue categories in 2006 clinton was the 32nd most liberal senator
2131021 the new yorker cover is aimed at very stupid mccain supporters and america sees that
2131022 hoagie has become just like the other obama supporters and gotten upset and rude when he she didnt have to do so
2131023 again though im not trying to convince bundy of anything i havent addressed him since last thursday and i wont unless he corrects his record of misrepresentation but he still seems to be stubbornly asserting his lie i dont expect any reversal
2131024 but when media outlets make attempts to censor the views of certain candidates by filtering the message or suppressing it outright it should concern americans of all stripes
2131025 people who like liver flavored ice cream have a weird sense of taste
2131026 idahogie claims that everyone who likes ice cream has no taste at all
2131027 people who send specific kinds of emails about obama are hiding their racism
2131028 please tell me where i made the statement idahogie says anyone who supports mccain is a racist
2131029 it is also amazing that idahoagie can blatantly label mccain supporters racist and stupid
2131030 fox is 1 and kicks cnn msnbc and all the big 3 networks combined every single night
2131031 nemesis please tell me what the other outlets mentioned that fox didnt that would excuse the times from blatantly censoring mccains piece and publishing obamas the fox piece gave all the reasons the times laid out for rejecting the piece your attempt at a hatchet job has no substance like i said show me what differences are in the story
2131032 i am not going to apologize one bit for questioning obama and pointing out the irony of this situation if people choose to start disrespecting people because of a disagreement then perhaps it it the hoagster that should voluntarily decide not to partake here exchange of opinion is what this is all about if you dont like it too bad and too bad that people choose to get nasty when there is no reason to
2131033 at any rate bundys latest post is really kind of bad i would think that any editorial page editor would send it back full of red ink
2131034 post 40 if people choose to start disrespecting people because of a disagreement then perhaps it it the hoagster that should voluntarily decide not to partake here
2131035 those people forwarding the obama is a muslim and michelle hates america emails are just looking for cover for their racism
2131036 your assertion that anyone who questions anything about obama is racist
2131037 please tell me where i made the statement idahogie says anyone who supports mccain is a racist
2131038 id be very eager to publish the senator on the op ed page however im not going to be able to accept this piece as currently written id be pleased though to look at another draft let me suggest an approach
2131039 it would be terrific to have an article from senator mccain that mirrors senator obamas piece to that end the article would have to articulate in concrete terms how senator mccain defines victory in iraq it would also have to lay out a clear plan for achieving victory with troops levels timetables and measures for compelling the iraqis to cooperate and it would need to describe the senators afghanistan strategy spelling out how it meshes with his iraq plan
2131040 the obama piece worked for me because it offered new information it appeared before his speech while senator obama discussed senator mccain he also went into detail about his own plans it would be terrific to have an article from senator mccain that mirrors senator obamas piece
2131041 the obama piece worked for me because it offered new information it appeared before his speech while senator obama discussed senator mccain he also went into detail about his own plans
2131042 a surge is really a counterinsurgency made up of a number of components im not sure people understand that surge is part of a counterinsurgency
2131043 because of the surge we were able to go out and protect that sheik and others and it began the anbar awakening
2131044 i rest my case and will leave this particular topic bundys lack of integrity for good
2131045 yes anyone sending around emails saying obama is a muslim and michelle hates america is covering for racism
2131046 focus our efforts on a more effective counter insurgency strategy and take steam out of the insurgency
2131047 people who like liver flavored ice cream have a weird sense of taste
2131048 idahogie claims that everyone who likes ice cream has no taste at all
2131049 please dont generalize that i dont think people should answer questions or some such
2131050 i took your statement and blew it out of proportion with the
2131051 that is obviously not true i did nothing of the sort and bundy was just lying but his lie had a purpose to weaken the racism accusation in general if the conservatives do this enough they will be able to paint any racism claim as just the absurd accusations of politically correct liberals
2131052 its just a he said she said thing we can all just have our own opinions and agree to disagree
2131053 i am intentionally calling you on your baloney liberal theories that paint any opposition to obama as racist
2131054 i said nothing about people who oppose obama for other reasons
2131055 fox is 1 and kicks cnn msnbc and all the big 3 networks combined every single night
2131056 given that he seems to think a criticism of obama must be because obama is black think how racist that view is
2131057 he was deliberately attempting to ridicule me and anyone else who supports sic bundys right to not support obama
2131058 and for the record i will not blatantly attack what i believe to be your lack of character
2131059 there is little doubt that you are going to be swift boated in some way during the campaign and that we are all once again going to be hit with the politics of fear how do you deal with that in the past democrats have cowered in front of that
2131060 there are things you can do individually though to save energy
2131061 making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups youd actually save just as much
2131062 i hardly think low tire pressure is not the answer to our energy woes
2131063 we can only hope that the president of the united states elected this november will listen conscientiously to the majority for whom the top priority is human survival

2131067 we made money on both events but not as much as we would have liked
2131068 i think it would be foolhardy to say we are recession proof but so far so good
2131069 you dont see a step fall in this business in previous downturns
2131070 youve also got 1 500 to 2 000 shops without horseracing pictures which is affecting the levy
2131071 the most important point is that so far neither william hill or ladbrokes has seen any slowdown from the consumer
2131072 confirmed annual inflation rates are likely to remain above levels consistent with price stability over a protracted period of time and risks to price stability in the medium term remain on the upside
2131073 we believe that the long term outlook for our business is excellent
2131074 the outlook for our us military and national security markets remains robust and we are confident that we will be slightly ahead of our growth targets for the year
2131075 in uk retail following a strong first four months of the year june suffered a string of poor results affecting all channels most notably royal ascot and the early stages of euro 2008

2131098 congress spends too much and he proposes more we need more energy and hes against producing it were finally winning in iraq and he wants to forfeit
2131099 in 12 months or sooner if requested by the government of iraq
2131100 this shows the support of the international community for what they are doing
2131101 the iraqi government is willing to protect the un and has expressed readiness to contribute financially to the building of the new un headquarters in baghdad
2131102 we hope they the un will re open their offices in different parts of iraq

2131134 although its reputation is built on its inflation fighting ability the bank has so far resisted the temptation to hike interest rates whilst the economy experiences its most significant slowdown since the early 1990s
2131135 we expect inflation to rise to about 5pc around year end even though the economy is probably in recession now
2131136 the outlook for our us military and national security markets remains robust and we are confident that we will be slightly ahead of our growth targets for the year

2131170 the idea that they have some bureaucratic definition that constitutes severe economic harm is really nonsense to me
2131171 they need to look at reality we got people that are hurting
2131172 i think this is the early stages of the destruction of the texas livestock industry
2131173 one of the biggest mistakes weve seen by the u s government in the last 20 years
2131174 you can know one thing im going to be standing up with them and keep fighting for them
2131175 im sure there are going to be challenges from other areas in the future

2131184 i beg your tolerance there is nothing i can do to make things any easier for any of us and you will have to accept being addressed by a disembodied voice just as i accept the compulsion to speak out even though i am painfully aware that i am talking to an invisible perhaps nonexistent audience wise men have regarded the earth as a tragedy a farce even an illusionists trick but all if they are truly wise and not merely intellectual rapists recognize that it is certainly some kind of stage in which we all play rolse most of us being very poorly coached and totally unrehearsed before the curtain rises is it too much if i ask tentatively that we agree to look upon it for as a circus a touring carnival wandering about the sun for a record season of four billion years and producing new monsters and miracles hoaxes and bloody mishaps wonders and blunders but never quite entertaining the customers well enough to prevent them from leaving one by one and returning to their homes for a long and bored winters sleep under the dust then say for a while at least that i have found an identity as ringmaster but that crown sits uneasily on my head if i have a head and i must warn you that the troupe is small for a universe this size and many of us have to double or triple our stints so you can expect me back in many other guises indeed do many things come to pass
2131185 so lock it up whatever you still want to own
2131186 as athletes we need to send the message to the khartoum government not to kill or bomb and to china to stop because those guns are not to defend the country but to kill innocent people
2131187 the fact hes getting to play in a pga event is amazing
2131188 but hes so excited about this what a neat experience
2131189 its a once in a lifetime experience were all so thrilled
2131190 ive got the greatest players the greatest parents here i just dont have the passion for teaching that i do for coaching
2131191 if i could just coach at auburn riverside and get a teachers salary i would do that for the rest of my life
2131192 i can only coach my team for five months a year
2131193 those are the rules and i support them but its hard
2131194 i think this program is at the best its ever been and thats how i want to leave

2131203 there are two ways to conquer and enslave a nation one is by the sword the other is by debt
2131204 what is the predictions posted by graham topp on august 7 2008 9 38 pm
2131205 mr chairman we have in this country one of the most corrupt institutions the world has ever known i refer to the federal reserve board and the federal reserve banks the federal reserve board a government board has cheated the government of the united states and he people of the united states out of enough money to pay the national debt the depredations and the iniquities of the federal reserve board and the federal reserve banks acting together have cost this country enough money to pay the national debt several times over this evil institution has impoverished and ruined the people of the united states has bankrupted itself and has practically bankrupted our government it has done this through the maladministration of that law by which the federal reserve board and through the corrupt practices of the moneyed vultures who control it
2131206 if the america people ever allow private banks to control the issuance of their currencies first by inflation and then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all their prosperity until their children will wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered
2131207 there are two ways to conquer and enslave a nation one is by the sword the other is by debt
2131208 the headline says a decade of cheap credit fuelled by rising house prices i think you mean a decade of rising house prices fuelled by cheap credit
2131209 by 2006 such funding equated to around two thirds of net new mortgage lending
2131210 a lack of liquidity caused by the belated recognition of bad lending in usa amp the global banking system
2131211 inevitable long term effect of government policies that have increased money supply and reduced financial regulation in an economic and political over reaction to world events

2131241 when he came into the weavers to replace pete seeger which was a pretty tall order he not only did that but he brought so much of his own talents to bear that it was overwhelming it really was
2131242 he was an absolutely logical person to be brought in
2131243 of the next generation of weavers i mean he was so outstanding that it was hard then or even now to imagine who else we could have brought in other than erik
2131244 three musicians who had recently been planning something with him told me he didnt tell them either
2131245 a close friend of his said he was a great eccentric sure he was also a beautiful soul i will miss him very much
2131246 i wasnt saying i was better than jay z as a person or rock was greater than hip hop as a thing or whatever it is
2131247 i said what i said and it was wrong or it was taken as wrong and now all this
2131248 my single went back in the charts profile went through the roof everyones a winner
2131249 he knows that i was misrepresented as i guess he was so lets move on
2131250 for my own part i can sit here and say i never dissed that guy i never would
2131251 but theres no point in going on about it because you end up sounding like
2131252 its a good business but it would take us two to three years to grow it while we can grow our businesses organically within six months
2131253 we believe that now is the right time to dispose of it because gibson has become the largest independent midstream oil an gas company in canada
2131254 we have looked at companies we havent just been sitting here waiting for this deal to close we are hopeful that by the end of the year we will be able to announce something along the acquisition line
2131255 thats why ill be spending the money as fast as i can
2131256 we are 12 months into the process of falling valuations however i am pleased to say our assets have held up relatively well it is a market to be invested in quality assets and uk regional shopping centres are very defensive
2131257 what will really worry the market is that bad debt provisions more than doubled 3pc of rent roll is now in administration
2131258 while 75pc of those in administration were still trading at end june this increase in one of the best portfolios in the uk gives us reason to be very concerned about anyone with a lower quality portfolio
2131259 any and all societal progress that black people have experienced is due mostly to the courage perseverance and radical love of everyday black folk
2131260 god demonstrates his love for us in this while we were still sinners christ died for us
2131261 you see you as an asian were never considered as much a threat to the social order as i as an african american especially at the time your parents came over
2131262 but talk to them about how the world perceive them that they got into school only due to affirmative action for openers and you will realize that society judges you differently on that basis
2131263 real american repentance for racism is going to cost us not just sentiment but also money and a lot of it
2131264 how would i know that was long before my granddaddy was born
2131265 you know a lot of slaves were really well taken care of
2131266 big deal the civil war didnt start out over slavery
2131267 asian store owners have often been viewed as predators who gave nothing back to the communities in which they were located that has little to do with spike lee
2131268 it was a big deal and the civil war certainly did start out over slavery
2131269 if i could preserve the union by freeing all the slaves id do that if i could preserve the union by freeing none of the slaves id do that if i could preserve the union by freeing some and not others id do that too
2131270 if you enjoy todays blessings even though none of your parents or you yourself ever paid the price for them why do you have such a reaction to the idea of paying for the sins you also had no part in
2131271 after all the fact that you and i actually did none of these evils doesnt seem to keep us from paying for them in every other way today
2131272 if we do not repent of the attitudes of our forefathers which were probably much the same regardless of where our parents came from we all will pay again and again and again
2131273 i would rather repent of the past and turn away from it in the hope i might see a future where my grandchildren do not have to have this discussion
2131274 i think the best way to do this would be to purposely stop living segregated lives but if it does cost me some money i would consider that a very small price to pay
2131275 actually it was more about states rights slavery was a tangential issue
2131276 only later down the road did he decide that slavery itself had to go
2131277 what i said is that asians were not seen as a danger to the established social order in the same way that blacks are which is true
2131278 hi im barack obama and im running for president of the united states remember to vote for me in november and if you dont think im funny youve obviously never seen me bowl
2131279 im not going to deliver this line any better than that
2131280 im john mccain and i approve this message a president has to be funny they just have to be
2131281 unfunny presidents only serve one term if they win an election at all
2131282 i may not be the last comic standing but im definitely the funniest candidate for president
2131283 army wives has a lot of great twists and turns i know because cindy makes me watch with her and were looking forward to season 2
2131284 i know you all are waiting to see what happens this season on army wives but i just wanted to take a moment to honor the people this show is about
2131285 as columbus goes so goes ohio as ohio goes so goes the nation
2131286 wallis support of every communist marxist regime and his strong anti american stance
2131287 betsy i think you may have proven jim wallis right
2131288 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
2131289 lasst uns in diesem augenblick wo kollektive egoismen fast berall auf der welt beunruhigende formen annehmen zeigen dass m nner und frauen unterschiedlicher kulturen in ein und demselben land harmonisch zusammenleben k nnen
2131290 am bewusstsein f r kultur auch in fragen der politischen kultur
2131291 weil es jetzt h chste zeit ist eine kulturpartei zu gr nden
2131292 aber jetzt spiele ich die rolle zu ende und wenn es am ende nichts wird muss man auch das einsehen

2131294 there is a broad view by the public that our health care system needs a full overhaul either to be totally rebuilt or reformed
2131295 often paperwork doesnt arrive or your records arent available when you show up there are also concerns about getting timely access to care
2131296 also having a regular doctor who is available to see you getting timely referrals and having more affordable care are important to people
2131297 we now spend twice per capita what other developed nations spend on care yet we die younger have worse access to care and are even behind on medical computerization
2131298 these survey results are a clarion call for the health financing mechanism used elsewhere nonprofit national health insurance
2131299 we have seen the number of uninsured rise we have seen people facing higher out of pocket costs we see layers of complications in terms of billing problems
2131300 all that adds up to an american public that is quite ready for health care reform
2131301 there is no doubt that anyone seeing that ad will know that it is beyonc
2131302 it is categorically untrue that lor al paris altered ms knowles features or skin tone in the campaign
2131303 is lighter than the way im used to seeing her
2131304 advertisers and magazines need to be careful about this even if its just a production process
2131305 weve got some experience and that plays a major factor even when you talk about athletic ability some of the guys theyve been out there before they know how to get into position and how to do things that experience is going to help us plus theyre a year bigger a year stronger and a year faster
2131306 hes a great player and we cant wait to get him back
2131307 it feels great being out here with the guys and just leading this team
2131308 this is what ive been waiting for this is my shot
2131309 theyre still trying to figure out how to line up correctly whoo they better get a lot better at that fast
2131310 though we dont think this type of advertising is appropriate for college sports we have tried this once before in this country and it didnt work very well
2131311 you always like to have experience its the one thing you cant manufacture you can get them strength but the only way to get experience is to get on the field you can do a lot of things in practice but until you get in a game you dont know what is going to happen but if you dont have it experience you dont have it
2131312 as it became apparent they werent going to continue to function they decided to sell off the licence we swooped in and grabbed it we took no assets there was nothing to be had to be honest were building everything from the ground up
2131313 youll venture through space exploring new civilizations and life forms
2131314 youll also beam down to planets and have adventures inside your ship its a galactic wide game theres going to be tons of space to investigate we have a great system for exploration which will allow for almost infinite possibilities
2131315 there might be a ship called enterprise flying around but its probably not the same ship anymore
2131316 most of the characters will have either retired or passed on but youll definitely be going to all the places you know and love from star trek expect to see oldies like vulcan and bajor but also fan favourites like andoria and qonos
2131317 youre going to see the actual game working and functioning
2131318 this isnt renders this isnt concept art everything that people will see on sunday is going to be taken right from star trek online as it stands today so hardened people should know that a release date might be closer than they think
2131319 you see it was the only workers i could get
2131320 you know who is in charge now the gestapo agents at homeland security they are in charge
2131321 every american should be offended and outraged by comparisons between our dedicated public servants risking their lives every day to enforce our immigration laws and the nazi secret police no matter who is making the comparison that such a vile statement was made by a member of congress is truly reprehensible and irresponsible
2131322 ice actions have been entirely legitimate and carried out in a professional manner in an effort to deal with a national illegal immigration crisis
2131323 such a reckless comparison to the gestapo borders in making such comparisons congressman gutierrez is providing license for people to resist by any means necessary
2131324 fair joins with dhs assistant secretary julie myers in demanding that the house leadership take action against representative gutierrez his statement deserves the strongest possible condemnation from his colleagues
2131325 gee whiz if we ban beer ads from our sporting events that hardly anyone under the age of 21 watches anyway that might prevent people from drinking
2131326 though we dont think this type of advertising is appropriate for college sports we have tried this once before in this country and it didnt work very well
2131327 assured that customers charged for spam could contact their service provider to have the charges removed from their bills
2131328 given these undertakings by bell mobility and telus i would encourage consumers dissatisfied with existing plans to seek alternatives
2131329 based on the level of competitive bidding that took place we think we are well on our way to achieving those goals
2131330 cellphone companies want to charge consumers 15 cents for each text message they receive including spam
2131331 cellphone companies are gouging consumers and our government stands back and watches
2131332 a good progressive tax policy so that we make sure were not tying the hands of communities
2131333 the republicans bringing this cap to the floor today particularly when the assembly is not called in is a political scheme
2131334 we want to see whether the provisions of the agreement are serious we will be satisfied if the agreement contains the withdrawal of us forces
2131335 if so we will complete the reorganisation of the mahdi army which aims to transform it into a social organisation
2131336 we will be forced to await the decision of withdrawal of american forces
2131337 previously many researchers had assumed that we are simply better at imagining objects staying in the same place but this study demonstrates that when we truly believe an object is moving along with us we can track it in our minds just as easily as if it was standing still
2131338 we can have a greater sense that theres a fair process underlying that pricing
2131339 i think one of the major reasons we have low gas prices
2131340 if you must see one killer croc movie before you die
2131341 and you feel pain just as they feel pain but you expect from god what they do not expect from god

2131364 today the iraqi oil ministry celebrates a return to work by iraqi oil exploration teams after 20 years of interruption
2131365 the ministry has begun to build new refineries in the country in the provinces of dhiqar kirkuk karbala and misan while renovating other refineries in baghdad basra and diwaniyah
2131366 further animal studies however are needed before the approach can be used on humans in clinical trials
2131367 but when you go to primates or humans the same small concentration is lethal
2131368 yeah thats the main reason most of these drugs they find working in mice its not that they dont work in humans its that the effective dose is so great its impractical or deadly
2131369 scientists discover the source of most modern diseases laboratory mice
2131370 the cure i am a cynic i say if you dont want hiv aids then stop having unprotected sex stupid humans
2131371 there were no warning signs no tape no cones nothing to suggest a hazard
2131372 not a gaping hole but certainly uneven it was being repaved and the work crews hadnt put down the final layer yet

2131374 foreseeable risks of harm from unusual danger of which the city knew or ought to have known
2131375 the amount of chats that they studied amount to approximately half of the instant message sent worldwide during that period
2131376 we do need that stepped up enforcement and i congratulate the pictou county enforcement officers for doing that the rcmp and local police over the last several months have laid several charges i think the last time i checked there was somewhere over 100 charges obviously we need to do more
2131377 driver distraction is a huge cause of accidents in this province and im hoping the public will understand thats why were doing this thats why we passed the law
2131378 we had a very impressive first flight and we are pleased with the results
2131379 this success verifies that the testing done in the boeing system integration laboratory and during ground testing was thorough enough to find the systems issues prior to the flight

2131394 new york is complaining youre too pro environment and they say youre ignoring the costs of environmental protection they want you to cover the internal revenue service
2131395 there is abundant evidence that the trillions of pounds of hazardous pollutants that have been poured into the environment are in all likelihood responsible for much of the sickness suffering and too often death of americas children
2131396 the effect on childrens health is like a world trade center in slow motion
2131397 no disease has ever been documented that stems from legal applications of pesticides
2131398 this is a good day for the tigers the zoo and the people of iraq
2131399 our heart goes out to the two tigers who had to endure the long trip to iraq and a dangerous future at the baghdad zoo
2131400 these tigers will be caged helpless and completely dependent on humans to survive in an area where many people live in fear and are still without access to basic necessities
2131401 we have the utmost concern for the well being of the tigers
2131402 we have full confidence that the baghdad zoo has the staff and facilities to care for them long into the future

2131440 she came up and said quietly you know some men find the sight of a bare breast quite offensive can i offer you a blanket to cover up with
2131441 the rep defended what the flight attendant had done she said we have to make our customers feel comfortable
2131442 i would like them to recognize it is a human right and to have a policy that protects respects and honours the human rights of all their passengers adults and children alike adults eat on planes babies should be able to as well
2131443 lexus is also the highest ranked nameplate in the study and has ranked highest each year since becoming eligible for the study in 1990

2131446 its an all you can eat buffet in a hotel or happy hour oyster
2131447 then youll hear them say oh its been a great year or theyll say oh no its been a really poor year for shape or size isnt there and we want to eliminate that
2131448 what more people are looking for is the same thing they look for in a wine they want a product thats coming from a particular place on earth and has the characteristics of that place
2131449 if the oysters are just being kept in one place and arent being moved around theyll develop the word thats used with wine terroir but if oysters are getting relayed to different spots for different reasons then its going to be a more muddled flavour
2131450 there are many valid reasons why women who have had abortions at the fredericton clinic would not or could not bring this challenge
2131451 dr morgentaler is therefore a suitable alternative person to do so
2131452 our pathways are designed for multiuse and all users have a responsibility to comply with the bylaws that were designed to keep calgarians safe
2131453 we will convert our five conventional banners over a 15 month period to the metro name following this conversion the metro banner will be a 376 store strong national network that will contribute to the companys future growth
2131454 we used to have this filled to the ceiling and wed pretty much have it half full in id say approximately six months
2131455 people now take them to electronic recycling depots where perfectly good stuff gets broken down for parts if its not working i can see it going to be recycled if its working i think somebody else should get it and give it a second life
2131456 were going to have to listen to all of the different views out there and come up with something that everyone is comfortable with certainly we know that re use should be a priority
2131457 here a laptop there a laptop everywhere an unencrypted laptop
2131458 i always thought that there was a semen database and that the bad guys just left semen all over everything
2131459 it just helps the police be more efficient and would save tax dollars because we could catch criminals faster and spend less on cops
2131460 we could get a situation where outside bodies like insurance firms manage to get hold of dna from innocent people and use it for their own purposes
2131461 its not like there would ever be a law for example that wouldnt allow a specific nationality to sit at the front of the bus
2131462 well sell you insurance but your genetic profile puts you at high risk for lung cancer so if you get it we wont cover you

2131466 the driver saw that the bridge was moving and was starting to fall
2131467 he immediately slammed on the emergency brakes and hid in the engine compartment of the locomotive

2131469 i heard a terrible noise i immediately left my office to see what had happened the image before me will never leave me until the day i die
2131470 it is not easy to speak when you have a catastrophe of such proportions before your eyes
2131471 the czech government will examine this catastrophe on august 20
2131472 if there had been the slightest suspicion of complications for example cranial head trauma then they would certainly have been kept in
2131473 our carriage was full of young people and we were having fun then there was the crash chaos people were dying they had no legs and arms i am alive i have been born again

2131482 la bonne tenue de nos exportations est nette pour mais aussi pour les biens de consommation et d quipement
2131483 les ventes dairbus sont en progression en revanche les exportations de lindustrie automobile sont toujours la peine et stagnent depuis deux ans
2131484 the forecast is based on a number of factors most significantly economic growth in diverse areas of the world
2131485 over the long term global economic growth will drive demand for new high value products as well as seasonal perishables that people have become accustomed to enjoying
2131486 we expect several trends to continue dedicated freighters will continue to provide an increasing proportion of air cargo capacity going to nearly 54 percent and the industry will continue to move to larger airplanes
2131487 additionally freighters will continue to comprise about 10 percent of the world jetliner fleet during the forecast period
2131488 the cms will neutralize mines in the beach and surf zone in advance of an amphibious assault by the marines
2131489 this capability will greatly enhance the sea services ability to project power and successfully complete a ship to objective maneuver
2131490 some tunnels want 100 a box some just 70 you have to compare prices
2131491 a tunnel can bring in a mobile phone but it cant bring in raw materials
2131492 its just a matter of time until they make a tunnel an elephant can walk through
2131493 we are happy to share with the world in these joyful moments but i am sad to see the big teams of many countries while our country is left behind with one of the smallest teams in the olympics
2131494 we had hoped that our country will participate with a large team in order to get good results in the games our interest in the olympics would have been greater
2131495 anyhow i will try not to miss the events they are in
2131496 we have waiting eagerly for this world event in iraq we are in desperate need for such issues in order to entertain ourselves and forget the miseries
2131497 this resolution expands the range of restrictive measures adopted by the u n security council
2131498 show restraint when granting new public loans for trade with iran and to also be vigilant on activities taken by financial institutions with banks based in iran
2131499 we do not understand why and we do not understand what changed
2131500 the sovereignty issue is very big for the iraqis and we understand that but we are losing patience
2131501 the process needs to get moving and get moving quickly
2131502 this move is meant to offer an incentive for the foreign forces to withdraw
2131503 the special cells of fighters will not strike against foreign forces until the situation becomes clear vis a vis the iraq u s agreement on the presence of american forces here
2131504 i think it is an important step that the gravity of the situation has been recognized and that there are some steps in place to turn the tide in afghanistan
2131505 whether that is successful or not is of course an open question
2131506 in terms of milestones its important to point out that no casualty is more significant than any other
2131507 each service member is equally precious and each loss of life is equally tragic
2131508 the reported presence in afghanistan of the head of al qaida in iraq underscores the extent to which blowback from iraq is being felt in afghanistan
2131509 at this point leadership seems to be looking at the afghan theater as the next big thing
2131510 the size of the operation and the ability of the group to get support within the town was somewhat alarming and it shows that there is clearly some concern with local afghans and thats a concern because civilians are the center of gravity in a counterinsurgency
2131511 the dangerous message is that there was involvement by the civilians
2131512 we will go back to our work and role as citizens who are concerned about public affairs in their country
2131513 were trying to be pre emptive with our operations to prevent it and make it an inhospitable environment for them
2131514 weve got operations to continue to make it an inhospitable area for them to return to so that they cannot get back into baghdad to get the population to realize theyre better off without them

2131586 the application was to protect the use of the term cloud computing as it relates specifically to our offering
2131587 at the time when we announced our solution it was not quite as pervasive a term we sought to protect our intellectual property and we certainly respect the intellectual property of other people and would not infringe on that of others

2131596 youll be walking through the barrens an area in wow and youll see a steam tank drive past you with five people sitting in it or youll see a death knight clad in frozen armor with five ghouls walking behind him this stuff is wrath only after seeing that who wouldnt want the expansion
2131597 they took it up a notch with the complexity of the scenes and the intricacy
2131598 they have some areas which are now misty which is a really interesting effect walking through a mist previously they had sort of grayed out the scene and called it mist but now its hard to peer through
2131599 theyve again taken the end game and made it more accessible to more people
2131600 without costing the high end players without giving up the challenge that keeps the high end players motivated
2131601 i think blizzard has learned a lot from the last expansion release
2131602 even a group of ten people will be able to conquer the very highest end game content while 25 man versions will let people who want to be more hardcore do that as well
2131603 if youre familiar with the mechanics of the 10 person version
2131604 then you should be familiar with the 25 person version at least in the philosophical sense

2131620 the market is continuing to favor first time home buyers
2131621 sales have been in a pattern of rising and falling within a fairly narrow range
2131622 because higher sales contract activity is necessary for overall recovery
2131623 foreclosure sales undoubtedly are a significant aspect of the improvement
2131624 it is making lots of homes affordable to buyers who have the credit and money but not a lot of income
2131625 everything taken together i believe we have bottomed when it comes to existing home sales
2131626 sales have leveled off recently because banks have been slashing prices on foreclosed homes
2131627 the housing market is continuing to act as a drag on the economy

2131636 i dont even have a word for it i am just so happy and so proud
2131637 i said i want to run fast like that and i want to run for that country
2131638 running is what we do all our lives it is part of our transportation so to see people watch somebody run and cheer for him i thought wow that is amazing

2131645 i think the golf course played tougher than the practice rounds
2131646 especially i personally felt that the greens got quicker today and firmer and the pin positions were tougher than the practice rounds

2131649 love to cut rates it will depend on issues at the time
2131650 i say to the commercial banks in australia that they have a responsibility to ensure that action by the reserve bank is reflected in the interest rate posture adopted by those commercial banks mr rudd in beijing for the olympic games told reporters
2131651 working families and australian pensioners and carers are under financial pressure from rents from mortgages from all sorts of cost of living pressures and therefore if banks are not going to do the right thing then were trying to make it possible for customers to vote with their feet he said
2131652 obviously there are a number of factors that we have to consider at the time of making a rate move mrs kelly told investors today
2131653 clearly we would love to pass through the full 25 basis points drop if that were to occur but well need to factor in all of those issues at that time
2131654 the strongest indication i can give you is that we want to pass on an interest rate cut if funding costs allow mr rowland said

2131664 you are always successful at being annoying you often fail at humor
2131665 proud americans should be ashamed at this type of crap as it contradicts the freedom and liberties that we have established in this country and sets us back ten fold

2131671 if you look at it from a family point of view it will be the good looking very popular younger brother of the other starwood philly airport hotels
2131672 whether or not the softness continues higher airfares will lead to reduced travel translating into lower occupancy
2131673 like other hotel companies is experiencing pressure on its occupancy levels and also cash flows but the company has an extremely strong balance sheet that provides it with great flexibility
2131674 demand in hotel rooms has slid in may and june which is probably a sign of the economy
2131675 its obviously not the best time for a new hotel to open at philly airport
2131676 and its overall occupancy should rebound relatively quickly to regain its usual top spot
2131677 so we didnt feel bringing in and introducing the third of nine starwood brands would cannibalize one of the two
2131678 we are seeing that because of the prices by the airlines for tickets there are people who are actually extending their stay
2131679 very chic almost a mid market type boutique hotel with a streamlined food and beverage element
2131680 people want to see it touch it and most importantly see how it performs against the more established older brands
2131681 now you have right in the heart of coal country the beginning of the solar century
2131682 it couldnt happen at a better time it couldnt be a bigger vote of confidence for pennsylvanias alternative energy policies
2131683 to think that were still sitting on probably 300 to 500 years of coal reserves it just shows that were trying to be innovative
2131684 the legacy of coal was one that when they left they left the scarred landscape behind as well
2131685 it was difficult to get anybody to take a second look at carbon county
2131686 the reality is we are putting the nuts and bolts together on the states entire energy package but that will come to fruition
2131687 just a commitment letter from the governor would suffice for the company to get the proper financing to make this thing work
2131688 what were doing fits hand in glove with the requirements
2131689 t he notion that more troops would mean more order i think is not a particularly controversial one
2131690 does john mccain deserve credit for pushing for that increase in u s troops a year or so ago that enabled the reduction in violence right now
2131691 well i dont know if he deserves credit i mean the notion that more troops might lead to more stability i dont think is a controversial one or it shouldnt have been
2131692 the thing that you know im struck by was how the generals who at the beginning of the war told the bush administration that more troops would needed to be do the job and maintain stability they were busted back for saying that
2131693 look our troops do a great job over there that doesnt change the fact that the rationale we were given is wrong and that we need to have a plausible strategy for withdrawing from iraq and i think thats something that the prime minister al maliki has recently said and that is a thats what we need to be focused on what is the strategy for american withdrawal
2131694 but a lot of people believe and you know this that if it had not been for that 30 000 or 40 000 increase in troops the relative quiet or stability thats developed in the al anbar province elsewhere in iraq might not necessarily have taken place and that mccain was out on a limb pushing for that
2131695 this is a sad instance of the civilian leadership making poor decisions while our men and women on the front lines have been performing excellent in the service that they give when theyre there
2131696 what mccain says is he can guarantee that if you end this war the way he wants it to end without a time line to just get the job done to win the u s will never have to go back to iraq but he says if you do it like senator obama is recommending a hard and fast 16 month time line you never know whats going to happen and the u s might down the road have to go back in
2131697 well you know the problem i think wolf with the senators position is he says do it my way no time line lets just have victory
2131698 i think the virtues of a time line is you start to look at facts on the ground what might change that will lead to an appropriate strategy for withdrawal
2131699 but senator mccain hasnt given a timeline he hasnt given a strategy hasnt defined what victory is and i think thats something that the american people and especially men and women in service are entitled to
2131700 mccain says its an important issue right now the u s should be doing it senator obama is not so sure maybe as part of a comprehensive compromise he might go along with it where do you stand personally on offshore oil drilling off the coast of virginia
2131701 in virginia weve taken a position both me as the governor and my legislature that we would like to explore natural gas reserves 50 miles off the coast not yet for drilling or production but for to explore to determine the size of the reserve
2131702 the federal moratorium against offshore drilling on the atlantic coast was the federal governments judgment that the costs outweighed the benefits
2131703 but my position is i think you need to do the exploratory drilling to determine what we have
2131704 now senator obamas position is pretty clear yes as part of a comprehensive plan drilling could be considered as part of it but first lets drill in the nearly 70 million acres of land that has already been leased to oil companies for drilling they have acreages leased already that could do significant good where they are not drilling before we wholesale hand over other acreages to them lets make them in the areas they currently have permission
2131705 in a highly competitive marketplace it is very difficult for one or a few institutions to hold the line on best practices or to stand on the sidelines in the face of booming markets
2131706 financial institutions must be subject to a higher degree of official oversight than is necessary for virtually all other forms of commercial enterprise however official supervision is not a substitute for effective management of financial institutions
2131707 whats needed is a form of private initiative that will complement official oversight by insisting on industry practices that will help mitigate systemic risk
2131708 were very fortunate weve had people come to conshohocken to invest and develop
2131709 at the same time because of the success of conshohocken our change from a blue collar to a white collar community weve lost some things towns can be a victim of their own success its time we add something for the residents
2131710 and we may still move the borough offices in there theres been no decision
2131711 most kids will be returning to school in last years duds
2131712 the consumer is taking the mind set that if i dont need it today then i am not going to buy it
2131713 we recognize that we are faced with a continued weak overall economic and retail environment and thus we are managing our inventory and expenditures very tightly
2131714 to protect freedom of expression freedom of religion and freedom of opinion in your country including tibet
2131715 using bigamy to paint them with a generally suspect brush to make them look bad
2131716 statutory requirement that applicants provide a social security number is wholly neutral in religious terms and uniformly applicable

2131722 there is no age too young to be spiritually married
2131723 at 13 or at 14 or at 20 you can have sex and not before
2131724 er you want to give these guys 99 years for what amounts to them by our cultural standards chastely and non sexually dating these girls where in the code does it say we can send them to jail for writing love letters
2131725 however people also need to be aware that evil people will use

2131728 he could not prohbit polygyny because it did not violate scripture
2131729 if you can take technical skills and turn them into something entrepreneurial
2131730 lots of people who graduate from mit start up their own technology firms
2131731 the net effect is that they are more ambitious when it comes to money
2131732 the raw talent is a primary factor but i think the experience somebody gets at their college plays a part
2131733 the network of people you meet and the kinds of experiences you have in and out of the classrooms helps form who you are and what you become
2131734 the happiest and richest people look for schools to help them develop their talents in whatever field that owns their soul
2131735 people in my class were very good at jobs where they follow rules doctors lawyers professions where you learn stuff and do it by the book
2131736 people who really break out of the envelope the really creative people in the world far more often than not did not go to brand name schools
2131737 to protect freedom of expression freedom of religion and freedom of opinion in your country including tibet
2131738 patients may not be learning this information from their health care providers and information regarding colon cancer prevention is not as well publicized as it could be
2131739 in the context of busy clinic visits it is in some ways efficient for patients to be reminded that physical activity is good for their health in general going through each specific health benefit of physical activity would take considerable time
2131740 sedentary people should first set such moderate achievable goals more benefits could accrue from higher levels and more intense exercise such as jogging running or tennis to some extent more may be better but it is important to note that a little is much better than nothing
2131741 im afraid like all fathers are afraid for their children its like all other sports its more dangerous than playing chess if thats considered a sport but i dont think its more dangerous than horseback riding and riding competitions
2131742 i think he has a really great career ahead of him
2131743 the initial injuries were reported as serious injuries but they have been upgraded again all the injuries that were reported are all non life threatening
2131744 we were very fortunate nobody was killed in this collision and again most of the injuries were minor in nature the location of the collision itself was close to a community centre where the bus passengers could be removed and taken care of
2131745 ems crews were on the scene immediately and setting up triage
2131746 we will carry on fighting and there will be more protests during the olympic games
2131747 any sort of jail time was the worst i was expecting but in fact the chinese government would not have allowed that to happen we were perhaps saved by the incredible pr strategy surrounding these olympics
2131748 after our arrests we were going into the complete unknown but in fact we made friends with the officers we ate with them we talked about their families and we asked about their lives in beijing
2131749 one officer said to me we may have different opinions but we can still be friends
2131750 they disrupted public order and violated chinese laws their period of stay in the country will hereby be cut short according to the law of the peoples republic of china on control of the entry and exit of aliens
2131751 we resolutely oppose such behaviour the olympics was a grand international sports gathering and we are resolutely against any attempts to politicise the games
2131752 china has stipulated laws and regulations concerning gatherings and demonstrations we hope foreigners who come to china can observe chinas laws and regulations
2131753 they disrupted public order and violated chinese laws their period of stay in the country will hereby be cut short according to the law of the peoples republic of china on control of the entry and exit of aliens
2131754 i think the chinese government is the kind of government that only responds to pressure it doesnt respond to olive branches
2131755 there is a whole campaign that will be going on throughout the olympics
2131756 we were treated very even handedly we were questioned but the police were kind to us we were treated fine
2131757 we were taken immediately to a police station and questioned one of the reasons that we were there was that tibetans couldnt be there in our place
2131758 they were refused visas and if anyone in tibet dared to protest they would certainly be treated much more harshly and would face torture and imprisonment
2131759 we were at the beijing olympics to highlight chinas use of the games to whitewash its

2131765 one officer said to me we may have different opinions but we can still be friends
2131766 we are only a very small part of this campaign and the ongoing struggle we will carry on fighting and there will be more protests during the olympic games
2131767 we were treated well there was some tough questioning after our arrests but nothing in respect of the way chinese citizens would have been treated
2131768 i cannot wait to put my arms around here and tell her i love her and im so proud of her
2131769 my worst fear was that chinese authorities would make an example of her
2131770 we are only a very small part of this campaign and the ongoing struggle
2131771 we will carry on fighting and there will be more protests during the olympic games
2131772 it was not difficult to get through the security as we had been planning this for four years

2131849 nigerias economy is petroleum driven and since this is so it would be good if students can stay in nigeria and help improve its economy
2131850 by working in the petroleum sector we can improve nigerias economy as a woman it gives me joy that ill be the pacesetter of nigerian women who would have received a very high quality education in nigeria and work in the downstream sector

2131853 every year thousands of africas most gifted children travel abroad in search of world class university education
2131854 secondly the facilities and equipment are obsolete half the students morale is always dampened that is why founders of this university found it not really necessary but highly desirable to give nigeria a world class university so that we can shorten both the distance and cost of acquiring world class university education abroad
2131855 we have always been scrambling to travel abroad to go and have world class university education but the europe and america where we go are yet to start falling over themselves to come to africa not because we dont have universities but they are not world class the standard is not as good as to attract foreigners to come and enroll the best they can do is to come to teach that is why founders of this universities found it highly desirable to give nigeria a world class university education so that we can shorten both the distance and the cost of acquiring world class university education abroad
2131856 a good number of nigerian students if not majority who have the opportunity of traveling to the us the uk europe come back a different set of people
2131857 that doesnt happen here so parents will like us to follow up to that whoever is interested in the education of his or her son daughter within the context of our cultural environment should rather send them to aun
2131858 what happens there is that generally people think about parties going to picnics going to eat on the streets etc
2131859 at a time when even terrorists bombs are rocking streets of the uk and us and the whole of europe where even the americans and europeans feel unsafe why should you then send your 15 year old daughter or son to go and fall into risks you better live him here
2131860 i dont think i would have enjoyed university education in any other part of the world other than the american university of nigeria this is where you come and you are taught academically the professors are excellent we are getting more for what we are paying if you are in aun you have to be thankful to god for being here
2131861 i would like to say something there is no point going to sokoto when what you are looking for is in sokoto as our people would say traveling abroad is not the actual thing aun is there whatever quality of education you want to get abroad you can get it in aun

2131867 working families and australian pensioners and carers are under financial pressure from rents from mortgages from all sorts of cost of living pressures and therefore if banks are not going to do the right thing then were trying to make it possible for customers to vote with their feet he said
2131868 we would like to cut those interest rates but we will have to assess what is happening to our funding costs at that time said anzs managing director for mortgages michael rowland
2131869 if they customers do not receive the full benefit of what the reserve bank has intended then in a way thats subverting what the reserve bank is trying to do through its monetary policy mr bradbury said

2132004 school mapping is the art and science of building geospatial data bases of educational demographic social and economic information for schools and educational directorates to support educational planning and decision making
2132005 and together they will enrich our decision making and planning processes to provide for our educational needs
2132006 this will eventually be pooled together with that of the 36 states to produce a map of nigeria indicating the location of all schools on it and by doing that we are going to have all schools at our finger tips
2132007 we are kick starting another level of school mapping exercise that will take care of the entire sub sector and this will also give us the opportunity of downloading the data into our collections posed from different agencies under the secretariat and other data institutions will be trained for the exercise and after the training it will move to the field to get the coordinators of all our schools
2132008 the lack of trained teachers and inadequate resources are threatening the commission and theres need to redress these problems
2132009 we the proprietors of private schools sat and agreed that we will not actively take path in the on going strike but will pay our allegiance as partners in progress
2132010 fees from the loan does not consider the rising price of commodities and fuel and we are disappointed to see that the loans from the ministry have not been reviewed to address the current cost of living for students
2132011 the affected students had to go back home because they do not have funds to register for the second semester we are dismayed by this situation because we expect the polytechnic of namibia management to deal with the issue with the ministry and not with the students
2132012 we are removing the language barrier and providing a valuable service to anyone traveling to beijing this summer
2132013 jajah was built to bring down barriers to global communication through high quality low cost calls available from any phone any network anywhere
2132014 no more translation books no hand gestures simply dial a local number say your message in english and hear it back chinese
2132015 any phrase can be translated and shared with others by passing the handset or activating the phones speakerphone function
2132016 you can guarantee that more of these will become common in future elections
2132017 more than likely the people who do this are the extremists or people who are in it for a profit campaigns need to become more aware of these kinds of attacks
2132018 campaigns are spending a lot on online advertising and some of this money is really being misspent and going to typo squatters
2132019 website poked fun at her and other candidates by depicting them as characters from
2132020 if i want to attack supporters of a particular campaign i can easily put malware on my site
2132021 you can target candidates cause confusion pop up ads or re direct computers when they try to log on to a candidates website
2132022 this is a serious problem that spans not only campaigns but every company with email
2132023 we continue to be candid about our belief that all people should have the freedom to say what they think and worship as they choose
2132024 we strongly believe societies which allow the free expression of ideas tend to be the most prosperous and the most peaceful
2132025 candour is most effective when nations have built a relationship of respect and trust
2132026 ive worked hard to build that respect and trust i appreciate the chinese leadership that have worked hard to build that respect and trust
2132027 we resolutely oppose any words or actions which interfere in the internal affairs of another country in the name of issues such as human rights and religion
2132028 the president has in the name of the european union just had a list of cases of individual prisoners and
2132029 he thinks he has a magic wand and that all of a sudden the chinese will smile condescendingly and say yes mr president and things will move forward i dont think so
2132030 the list handed over to the chinese authorities includes all the cases mr daniel cohn bendit and various human rights organisations wish to see raised
2132031 today mr sarkozy is losing on all fronts whether human rights and frances international image or its relations with the chinese authorities who now know how seriously to take french demands
2132032 shine a spotlight on the chinese governments lethal military crackdown inside tibet and its attempt to use the beijing olympics to cover up its
2132033 as the chinese government has done everything in its power to silence tibetan voices at this critical moment it is imperative that global citizens speak out
2132034 the united states believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings
2132035 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labour rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
2132036 we resolutely oppose any words or actions which interfere in the internal affairs of another country in the name of issues such as human rights and religion
2132037 we are making clear to china that being a global economic leader carries with it the duty to act responsibly on matters from energy to the africa
2132038 the american people care deeply about the people of burma and dream for the day the people will be free
2132039 its only than shwe and a few other generals who want to isolate burma so i told him engagement was very important
2132040 the united states believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings
2132041 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents and human rights advocates and religious activists
2132042 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labour rights not to antagonise chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
2132043 the chinese people enjoy religious freedom according to law thats a basic fact evident to all
2132044 we are willing to constantly strengthen our dialogue and cooperation with the united states in order to properly handle differences and sensitive issues
2132045 obviously i didnt want something that was toxic that could hurt the dogs or the kids
2132046 which building product with recycled content gives the biggest bang for the buck
2132047 most people would say that noise is the biggest issue
2132048 there are a lot of energy star dishwashers that doesnt mean they are all rated equally
2132049 ospreys swoop in and the herons are there all the time
2132050 there are lots of bluegills in the pond eels in there too
2132051 roman lemon and thai we do a lot of thai cooking
2132052 we sit out here in the morning and have coffee
2132053 the lid on the forgery blew open when two students were arguing over their admission when one with similar deficiency was not admitted but his friend gained entrance with forged papers
2132054 there will be market discipline in labour mobility and we will be able to eliminate the systems distortions
2132055 a well run nigerian university system with competitive salary structure and stability will attract the best hands across the globe as a result of labour mobility based on the law of demand and supply
2132056 we now find a situation where students are moving to our neighbouring countries education because of the stability of their university calendar
2132057 born of love and cast in light dont you know we can not die we are stars we are stars that shine stars that bleed silver seeking destiny

2132061 i just kept picturing what the artwork would look like
2132062 i like the juxtaposition of the black walls and the white floors
2132063 whats driving interest right now is that people are worried about it whats the value of my home
2132064 and then theres the life goes on factor people are still changing jobs families are still getting bigger if anything they tend to nest in this environment
2132065 we came we saw we swung a hammer kind of story
2132066 i think people want to see the good guy win
2132067 before when they came in it was more this is such a mysterious town with such great backdrops
2132068 here is a city of great characters with big personalities
2132069 thats something that seems lost in america right now when everything feels so homogenized
2132070 neighborhoods that are not getting creative and taking matters into their own hands will lag behind
2132071 i think people are receptive rich middle income or poor to any assistance they can get
2132072 if someone is willing to come in and help i dont think theres a problem with that theres so much to do
2132073 its as if katrina has made new orleans an incubator or testing ground for design ideas
2132074 the bears do appear to have momentum on their sidehere
2132075 technically there isnt a whole lot youcan talk about until you get down to 3 00
2132076 fund co managed by conquest and the adviser to alarge pension is no longer offered and is being unwoundbecause the pension has decided to manage its commodityexposure internally
2132077 if you put these items in the back you can get more stuff in
2132078 the number of our troops in afghanistan is only going up and so we want to make sure that as were growing that we have the most efficient and effective command structure in place
2132079 jura did you know you have millions of ants marching along the back of your kitchen counters
2132080 it might help to dig out the plat or property map that you received when you bought your home
2132081 our biggest disappointments this quarter were the downgrades by standard amp poors and moodys investors service which had a significant impact on our asset management business and our ability to write new insurance business
2132082 while the deterioration in the housing and mortgage markets continued over the past three months it has been consistent with what we projected when we established reserves and impairments for our housing related portfolio in the first quarter
2132083 its all too much an easy plan for living a richer life with less stuff
2132084 oh my god a side effect is that i suddenly find im losing weight
2132085 the president has therefore directed that you halt the eviction of pupils and compensate the purchaser accordingly
2132086 this compensation should take immediate effect in order to salvage this school which is supposed to cater for the underprivileged urban children
2132087 we were trying to find the people who shaped the industry today
2132088 one of the pioneers of the design build process which revolutionized residential remodeling
2132089 has elevated the image of remodelers and demonstrated that remodeling is a separate industry from home building
2132090 made money readily available for many homeowners as mortgage rates dropped home values increased leading to more home equity that could be pulled out for remodeling projects and other spending
2132091 a pioneer in bringing women into construction from the early 1970s he had women working in sales design and other nontraditional roles
2132092 one of the goals in an open floor plan is to share light by moving it from outside to inside the other goal is to take spaces that are small and make them more comfortable
2132093 we wanted to give them a fair price we knew it was a good deal and we knew the house
2132094 they said they wanted to have a more sensible entryway and an updated kitchen that wouldnt be so closed off from the living room
2132095 because of how the space was designed the furniture placement forced you to look at the front door
2132096 we drew a line in the sand about what it was sensible to spend
2132097 i think were about even depending on where the market is going
2132098 sconces lend a very immediate sense of elegance to a space
2132099 in a better sconce the detail will be there once you start to really look at it
2132100 a better sconce will have a better socket maybe take a 100 watt bulb
2132101 consumers should be able to find a good wall sconce for no more than 150
2132102 none of the more sexy energy saving installations small windmills on the roof photovoltaic panels solar water collectors make any sense until youve done your insulation weatherstripping and other fundamentals
2132103 if you put in compact fluorescent lighting today you wont have to change those bulbs for a couple of years at least and systems are quickly evolving to deal with disposal as more and more people do this
2132104 were starting to move our noise sources closer to us
2132105 you have the refrigerator the dishwasher right where youre going to be watching tv or playing games with your family weve moved our washer and dryer upstairs its more convenient that way but now you have to design for this
2132106 the effects of noise on hearing have been well documented over the years
2132107 dont require any extra money just extra care and thought
2132108 even though it sounds expensive it will be the cheapest solution
2132109 reducing the echo tends to dampen many noises which otherwise would bounce around the walls and hardwood floors causing the home to be much louder
2132110 the science of isolating sound in walls isnt that complicated you dont need fancy materials
2132111 such noise can travel much further in a building and it can be really difficult to mitigate
2132112 just move your chair around to maintain face to face communication
2132113 we are finding that the consumer is demanding more sound and noise control in the home
2132114 designed to enhance any rl painted wall and emulate the radiant effect of flickering candles
2132115 besides the 651 students the cavalla rubber plantation in maryland county has hired 600 students while the ministries of labor and youth and sports hired 200 and an additional 200 have also been hired in grand bassa county
2132116 web presence measures the activity and visibility of the institutions and it is a good indicator of impact and prestige of universities
2132117 rank summarises the global performance of the university provides information for candidate students and scholars and reflects the commitment to the dissemination of scientific knowledge
2132118 this ranking mainly considers research that is online makerere needs to improve this area because ict has become a major component in research
2132119 we wanted to address a couple of the questions concerns over the design the homeowners did not like the current layout of the cabinets the present folding area was not being used because it was not near the washer dryer it has become a place to stack and leave items also the cabinetry was peeling and damaged they wanted to use a large portion of the room for storage the 24

2132124 the police arrived at around 9 30pm and shot in the air as students pelted them with stones until up to 3 00am when sanity was restored
2132125 the students went wild and threw stones at teachers in the staffroom who were marking the end of term exams
2132126 we went to the dormitories and confiscated knives batons cookers mobile phones and radio sets
2132127 this angered them and they promised to harm the school
2132128 we interrogated the suspects and learnt that we arrived at the scene a few minutes before the students who had rushed to town to buy petrol returned
2132129 after the police officers stopped firing some daring students attempted to disarm a policeman thinking he had run out of bullets
2132130 progress thus far includes the enrolment of 360 000 learners recruitment and training of 24 000 volunteer educators 2800 supervisors and 150 coordinators
2132131 there were approximately nine million functionally illiterate south africans and the department seeks to halve the number by 2012 and ensure that by 2020 every citizen is able to read and write
2132132 the campaign will ensure that there are not more than 15 learners to one teacher in the adult schools because they need certain attention to ensure the effectiveness of the campaign

2132138 my heart melted around them so i just went ahead and gave it to them
2132139 i remember danielle in particular she just had such a sweet face
2132140 it inspired me to try to work harder in swimming and try to be an inspiration to others
2132141 it was just a sign of something to them that you could reach for the stars
2132142 they werent meeting a movie star with glasses she could be a normal person and still have that level of achievement
2132143 it turned out he was a good teacher and they were good students
2132144 everybody expected that abby was going to make the team but thats the way sandy is she rises to the occasion
2132145 ralph lauren was a perfect fit for us as not only do they present a timeless and quintessentially american look but they also have a great understanding of the importance of this moment in presenting these american ambassadors on a world stage in a manner that is appropriately dignified
2132146 over all we see our involvement in sports marketing as a global effort to bring fresh new energy and elegance to the world of sports
2132147 these games will be viewed by an estimated and unprecedented four billion people along with 24 hour coverage in multimedia outlets worldwide
2132148 we feel that this is a great platform for exposure and are thrilled that the ralph lauren brand will be seen by that depth of audience
2132149 lys ability to design urban sportswear that is technically advanced is perfectly aligned with hbcs vision to infuse current fashion trends into the olympic collection
2132150 this was an opportunity for us to keep our experimental design process alive and kicking
2132151 we were able to test some of our own research like the three to four gradiant color shades seen in most of the pieces
2132152 you actually have neurons reconnecting from one cell to a different cell
2132153 this kind of dramatic rewiring happens predominantly if not exclusively in early development
2132154 the ability to rewire neurons in that physical way seems to become much harder with age
2132155 evolutionarily somehow it seems to be advantageous to stop that process to stabilize the networks in your head and go on with life
2132156 it indicates that the sensory organs in the periphery the eyes at the front of the head have a mechanism to tell the brain when the eyes are ready and actually seeing something meaningful
2132157 every sensory system has some kind of message to send to the brain to make it plastic at some time
2132158 start to tell us how external information can directly affect molecular mechanisms of the brain
2132159 there are still many more studies that need to be done to understand plasticity in other parts of the brain and how to translate it to human problems
2132160 i have my opinion on it but i want to talk to him first then ill tell the world
2132161 people really are selling their talent in a way that can make them money
2132162 they really know that if they work with the government theyll benefit
2132163 he went from being this renegade making films that were banned and an eyesore for the chinese government to kind of being the pet of the government in some peoples eyes
2132164 there was hardly anything for the bowlers on the pitch just that we didnt bat well
2132165 if we take one or two early wickets tomorrow we are very much in the game
2132166 i went to the match confident after taking three wickets in a warmup match so i did not feel nervous
2132167 it was a big moment for me to get sachin tendulkar
2132168 but when were standing there not doing anything on the field ill wear it
2132169 we have gone through a very extraordinary process to improve its air quality and we have achieved outstanding results
2132170 i dont know how you reverse some of these things
2132171 lets hope thats one of the legacies of these games that the realization of the damage thats been done and will continue to be done unless they are more careful
2132172 i dont want to offend anyone but im out for my own health really and im sure that they know that the air quality is not good so i dont see its that bad wearing a mask
2132173 its different than what i remember from last year in that the pollution looked more yellow and dark
2132174 its whiter this year i think its a combination of a different time of year and little bit more mist and humidity in the air so it doesnt look as bad but you can still kind of taste it
2132175 faithfully confessed to having had access to a banned drug and he explained the context in which he received the substance
2132176 a weight was lifted from me today because i cooperated
2132177 i hope that the court is happy that i have cooperated
2132178 if the olympic games were not in china i would never have made all the effort to come back
2132179 the first six months were really difficult especially for my husband
2132180 he wanted to move back but after six months it was getting better
2132181 when i was in nanjing i was in the street and people start calling my name even after 20 years
2132182 when they call my name i was a little embarrassed
2132183 age is all relative and if you think youre old youre old
2132184 we knew two years ago that it would be a benefit for her for fencing and for our team were certainly going to get more chinese crowd support here because of her
2132185 reflexes matter but the younger kids tend to do things faster but they then make mistakes faster and will repeat the same mistakes
2132186 obviously the focus right now is on the olympic games and not on the rankings
2132187 but rafa has done very well the last year or so to become number one in the world
2132188 the last couple weeks have not been the best i think i lost matches i should never have lost
2132189 in a way they hurt but at the same time i didnt play badly by losing which is obviously important toronto and cincinnati werent the tournaments that are going to make me cry for months and months its really the olympic games and the u s open that matter to me in this point of my career
2132190 i dont know whats nicer but i guess it was meeting the girlfriend
2132191 because weve been together for eight years whereas the flag was only there for 10 minutes
2132192 its simple people get it and you dont have to explain it everybody could relate to it i miss it and i think other people will too
2132193 its crazy terrible the stupidest thing that ever happened to the sport of gymnastics how could they take away this beautiful this most perfect thing from us the one thing that separated our sport from the others
2132194 at first it was very hard to make the transition but now i think were used to it even though the fans might not be
2132195 i do think a lot of people who watch these olympics might be kind of confused
2132196 i was like wow you want me to do all of that is that possible
2132197 but then i realized that i need to do all that with this new scoring if i even want to think about a gold medal i said o k cool ill learn it
2132198 in one segment back to back she does six d or e elements which is pretty amazing
2132199 now we have to go against holland then nigeria i couldnt be happier the guys couldnt be happier coach peter nowak couldnt be happier
2132200 we created a lot of chances and we were dangerous in the final third
2132201 we did have some good cooperation but we made mistakes
2132202 i would like to thank the shenyang fans for supporting us despite the difficult situation we were in
2132203 the players didnt give up in the end and the fans didnt give up either
2132204 i lose six points in a row that never happens
2132205 i got a little bit nervous and he played well on those points he went for big shots and they worked for him i got a little bit tired
2132206 it took awhile for me to get into the match my legs were heavy he served very well and i wasnt moving well
2132207 he played well but i dont think i played the way i wanted to play
2132208 i had my best win and i couldnt play at the same level
2132209 thats something i have to change i dont think its a matter of the shots or the strategy i think its the mental part of it playing at the same level playing consistently
2132210 its always hard playing an american when youre in the usa so i just tried to focus on the whole match i like the atmosphere here and the people
2132211 he was asking about some of the mental mistakes that ive made and i told him it was a one time deal and it wouldnt happen again
2132212 everybody when they come here to new york wants to prove in a statistical manner that they belong
2132213 it will turn around for him and if it doesnt but we win the game what can you do its not like hes scuffling for a job or something
2132214 if you guys think this bullpen is bad go follow some other teams around and see what you come up with
2132215 messi had a fantastic game just like every other player
2132216 he has fantastic pace and he had prepared himself for this game very well along with his teammates and after a lot of effort he finally adapted to the hot weather so all our efforts in him have paid off
2132217 messis going to be with us through the entire tournament and we are very optimistic about our prospects
2132218 it was really difficult to play against a team like argentina because they are very good players and they have a lot of experience
2132219 but we messed up there were too many mistakes and too many fouls the most important thing is that we are here we are looking forward to playing our next two games against serbia and australia and we still have the chance to get through to the quarterfinal
2132220 it will take a couple months before lime cafe becomes profitable but sales are on the rise i have no doubt well be successful

2132231 while many medical blogs provide valuable information to the public are respectful in tone and are written anonymously others pose a threat to patient privacy and have the potential to threaten the integrity of the medical profession
2132232 unfortunately no professional organization has taken the initiative to provide guidance on this issue as the number of medical blogs grows professional organizations medical educators and the blogging community must address the challenge of this new medium by setting guidelines and standards for what is appropriate

2132240 on behalf of the 26 000 members of the federal law enforcement officers association fleoa i take great exception to your disparaging remark communities are terrorized by ice immigration raids
2132241 while the dedicated men and women of ice endeavor to carry out their dangerous and noble missions you somehow felt compelled to characterize their efforts as something akin to terrorizing
2132242 its one thing to remark intelligently on the need for immigration reform but its quite another to berate ice law enforcement officers who are risking their lives to enforce the laws passed by congress
2132243 your bi partisan fumble should not translate into labeling our members as terrorists by implication
2132244 ice employs patriotic men and women who are outstanding law enforcement officers not rampaging home wreckers

2132246 to bypass the neurotoxicity new anti mitotics are being generated
2132247 early clinical studies show that these drugs do not result in significant neurotoxicity
2132248 basically we just watched the cells using time lapse microscopy
2132249 this allowed us to track behavior of individual cells and determine their fate when exposed to different anti mitotic drugs

2132251 the test is a measure of long term glucose control but doctors dont typically use it to screen for or diagnose the disease theres reason to believe it could help identify many of the estimated six million people in the u s who have diabetes but dont know it
2132252 if a patient is scheduled for a physical he or she may tune up by changing their regimen for a few days and throw off their test results causing doctors to miss the patients usual pattern of high blood sugar

2132255 how much oil could americans save if we all took measures like properly inflating our tires getting regular tune ups regularly changing our air filters and driving more efficiently the answer using current numbers from the bush doe and epa the answer appears to be some 2 5 to 3 million barrels a day 20 times what could be found if we ended the congressional moratorium on offshore drilling and three times the oil we are likely to find in the arctic national wildlife refuge
2132256 please pick your stupid jaw or whatever it is off the floor
2132257 when you finish picking your jaw off the floor please let me know what you think of the senators plan
2132258 repealed as of the date of enactment of this act
2132259 all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling
2132260 some of those clumps are so dense they will emit a lot of gamma rays if there is dark matter annihilation and it might easily be detected by glast
2132261 one wonders whether the north koreans sensing how completely lefkowitz has been marginalized in washington simply withdrew his permission to visit
2132262 we understand the north has refused to register the application by the special envoy
2132263 i understand the norths explanation is his visit to kaesong wouldnt be appropriate
2132264 every day that its down we lose about 1 million barrels of oil that otherwise would be available to the global market
2132265 this advance isnt very inspiring it looks like more of a near term correction
2132266 it was about two or three months ago all the taxis in our company had this fitted
2132267 there is a screen which displayes the exact location of the vehicle the taxi is also able to send information back to us at the control station all the taxis registered with us have had the modifications
2132268 people were being invited in to discuss their cases and then were being detained and taken away via the back door i saw this happening today so i ran away and hid for fear of being detained
2132269 no one wants to see a household lose their home and repossession typically leads to a loss for the lender as well
2132270 one year into the credit crunch the number of people being repossessed is rapidly rising with these figures showing the biggest increase in a half year period since 1996
2132271 with current fears that unemployment is set to grow there is no doubt we are inching ever closer to the dark days of the last repossession crisis
2132272 we know that behind these figures are thousands of families facing sleepless nights worrying about how to make their next mortgage payment and many thousands more will be waking up to the frightening reality of repossession
2132273 government urgently needs to step in to prevent thousands more families from losing their homes and provide the significant financial support troubled homeowners need to keep a roof over their head
2132274 rising mortgage and other living costs are behind the increase in repossessions as people struggle to pay the bills
2132275 one of the problems is that a lot of people dont realize that they are having a stroke
2132276 there still needs to be a lot of education in the community for people to recognize these symptoms and when you recognize them call 911
2132277 there is also delay time among people who get to the hospital quickly so there is room for the medical community to act
2132278 once you get there you need to be diagnosed theres a very narrow window in which you can get treatment
2132279 we found that women were less likely to get timely treatment
2132280 also treatment was faster in hospitals that were certified stroke centers which have a formal plan for diagnosis and treatment
2132281 they were treated more quickly when they arrived by ambulance
2132282 it is better to call the ems than to take yourself to the hospital
2132283 the whole thing is recognizing a stroke on both ends the person who is having it getting to the hospital in timely fashion and also when they arrive at the hospital
2132284 so that when they walk in they are not given a number by someone and put in a corner for several hours
2132285 if something happens and it is a very severe stroke and someone suddenly stops breathing what are you going to do stop the car and give cpr
2132286 the important thing is to get to any hospital right away

2132290 we felt that we really should have done this 10 years ago but we cant start it 10 years ago we can only start it today
2132291 from a purely planning perspective we are looking at the widest scenario but that is not to say that is what it will ultimately be in every area
2132292 right now it is a planning study until you get to the actual design once we get to a preferred alignment based on all the input and the constraints then you do a more detailed schematic at that point in time we would know more about what that footprint will look like
2132293 the positive side of buying right of way now is it will be way cheaper today than it will be in the future
2132294 the negative side of it is that if you say this is where our corridor is going and dont actually purchase that property then really youve harmed those property owners then they cant ever sell their property you cant do that to people
2132295 txdot should be out here designating and buying right of way and everything else
2132296 the county shouldnt have to do it but the county cant wait for txdot to get its business in order
2132297 this is not one of the projects they had planned but northern williamson county has been largely underestimated in terms of population growth
2132298 we live it and see it every day and that is why we took the lead on this so that we could do this study and identify where the road alignment needs to be in the future

2132302 is what leads many people to insist on the pricey name brand drugs
2132303 im happy for you that you were able to prove yourself right
2132304 the dollar is strenghening across the board but its by default because were getting downside surprises on the economy in the uk and europe
2132305 britons have had the cash machines in their gardens taken away and weve got a consumer led slowdown
2132306 one question we are mulling is the closeness of the vote and whether there is still a significant danger of the committee raising rates especially as our forecasts show cpi inflation at 5pc in september
2132307 as soon as a durable peace takes hold we need to move forward with dialogue and peaceful negotiations
2132308 we set up a massive political operation that was aimed at really continuing that permanent campaign way of governing
2132309 we got caught up in the excesses of the permanent campaign culture in washington d c
2132310 these partisan excesses that have existed because of the permanent campaign in washington d c
2132311 come to grips with the fact that things went terribly off course
2132312 to come to grips with the realities of how things went so badly off course
2132313 this is my honest perspective on how things went off track
2132314 we got caught up in playing the washington game the way its played today
2132315 its just the way the game has become played in washington and we embraced it too often
2132316 we have to recognize that there isnt anything out there that is going to get us away from a hydrocarbon economy anytime in the near future
2132317 there really isnt anything on the horizon that today is economic relative for example to basic good old oil and gas
2132318 the solution for us in the near term near term being over the next few years is to increase production
2132319 for far too long too many politicians have advocated all kinds of other courses of action without facing up to the basic fundamental fact that today we have a hydrocarbon economy and if youre going to have cheap affordable energy available in the amounts it needs to be to run our economy youre going to have to produce more of it
2132320 the flames of self centered morality are licking at the very foundations of our society
2132321 im not going to go around making up songs about such a serious matter as going to war with a sovereign nation as senator mccain did
2132322 jerusalem will remain the capital of israel and it must remain undivided
2132323 i will always keep the threat of military action on the table to defend our security and our ally israel do not be confused
2132324 let me know if you see this guy named barack obama because he sounds pretty scary
2132325 in the spring the flowers are fantastic in the fall the its just such a kind of a place thats so fresh in the winter of course its got a lot of snow laughter summer is real hot but its we love it out here its beautiful
2132326 to issue a timely warning to citizens in the storms path
2132327 im going to keep making my case until we have a nominee
2132328 by their own admission its been the most slanted press coverage in american history
2132329 every time you turn on the television and listen to one of the people dissing her they all have a college degree theyve all got a good job theyve all got health care and theyre having no trouble filling up their gas tank
2132330 it does seem as though the press at least is not as bothered by the incredible vitriol that has been engendered by the comments by people who are nothing but misogynists
2132331 theyve declared her dead more time than a cats got lives
2132332 she will have won a majority of the votes cast in all the states in spite of being outspent by something like 60 million in every single electoral map ive seen she is beating senator mccain handily and she is the only democrat who is doing that today
2132333 these people who are saying the delegate race is over are depending on the democrats decapitating florida and michigan thats the dumbest thing ive ever heard of in my entire life
2132334 if i could only get her to have sex with me
2132335 i came of age when he was president running for president
2132336 we have to be the party of sams club republicans not just country club republicans
2132337 its good for my ego but probably not much else
2132338 i dont expect to be a member of the ticket
2132339 say what you will about barack obama people gravitate when you have something positive to say
2132340 one of the questions that inevitability will come is when will the decision be made
2132341 and i just want to address that right off the top i dont have any particular insights as to where brett favre is going to play next year
2132342 wow she didnt even bother to register to vote so she could vote for herself
2132343 and after seeing the make of some of the suits and dresses in this room
2132344 pray that the beloved anchor of meet the press is now sitting at the large table of the lord to begin a conversation which will last forever
2132345 its a crime against our future that since 1995 so many here in the congress and of course in the white house opposed increasing fuel economy standards for so long
2132346 the prerogative of the chair to get in the last word
2132347 74 cents higher than it was when the new majority took control of this congress
2132348 washington republicans continue to advocate for the same failed energy policies that got us where we are today
2132349 may i offer a suggestion to the democrat leadership admit you made a mistake
2132350 the two men most responsible for the prices at the pump are president bush
2132351 waiting for the windmills and the solar panels to kick in is not the responsible answer
2132352 the price of oil has gone up like a roman candle
2132353 president bush and his rubber stamp republicans have opposed common sense legislation to address high energy prices
2132354 congress should not leave town this week until we vote on meaningful solutions to help lower gas prices

2132359 we are not trying to cause the economic collapse of the roman catholic church but to illustrate to the court the magnitude of the plot against our order
2132360 exonerate a man who has been in prison for 21 years and help solve a similar local crime says
2132361 the first in the nation in which a crime victim or a victims relative has joined a prisoner in a lawsuit seeking dna testing
2132362 its baffling to me theres no reason why we would not go to court
2132363 its rather silly to turn over physical evidence on an unsolved murder to a person who has no business conducting an investigation
2132364 if there is evidence you can bet law enforcement is fully pursuing those things and well get them accomplished
2132365 certainly we would all like to believe that the da wants to see justice done and protect the citizens of the county

2132368 it now appears likely that real gross domestic product will not grow much if at all over the first half of 2008 and could even contract slightly
2132369 am i correct in understanding that you now believe a recession is possible
2132370 the most wrenching since the end of the second world war
2132371 the situation is bad its getting worse and the risks are that the situation could be very bad
2132372 we dont see it as being a broad financial concern
2132373 it is an attack on the black church launched by people who know nothing about the african american religious tradition
2132374 if you think im going to let you talk about my mama and her religious tradition you got another thing coming
2132375 he had to distance himself because hes a politician from what the media was saying i had said which was anti american
2132376 we both know that if senator obama did not say what he said he would never get elected
2132377 politicians say what they say and do what they do based on electability based on sound bites based on polls

2132381 so what can a corporation do to protect itself against punitive damages awards such as this
2132382 what you have today are 32 000 plaintiffs standing before this court each of whom have received only 15 000 for having their lives and livelihood destroyed and havent received a dime of emotional distress damages
2132383 i assume the test is the person has to be high enough that it justifies holding the entire corporation
2132384 the corporations responsibility or complicity or culpability is simply not relevant under your theory of the case
2132385 i believe that socially assistive robotics has a part to play in helping families both the affected children and their parents and siblings
2132386 we found that the behavior of the robot affects the social behavior of a child both human human interaction and human robot interaction social behavior with a contingent robot was greater than with a random robot
2132387 generally when the robot was acting contingently the child was more sociable

2132390 that which is discussed in the secret session cannot be revealed even if it is of a non classified nature
2132391 when the phone rings whether its 3 p m or 3 a m in the white house there is no time for speeches and on the job training
2132392 that 3 a m or 3 p m phone call means a lot
2132393 voters shouldnt have to wonder about whether their president will be ready at 3 oclock in the morning when the phone rings
2132394 they shouldnt have to worry about whether all of the steps necessary have been put in place so that that telephone shouldnt have to ring
2132395 this president the next president will definitely be ready on day one and prepared to answer the phone regardless of the time
2132396 senator theres been a lot of talk about the 3 a m phone calls
2132397 certainly your husband must have gotten some in his presidency can you talk about your role
2132398 i was there for a lot of phone calls at different times of the day and night and i have a very clear idea of what it takes to be prepared and ready to not only answer the phone but then to make the decisions
2132399 senator mccain will bring a lifetime of experience to the campaign i will bring a lifetime of experience and senator obama will bring a speech he gave in 2002
2132400 a major recession that reduces demand and even then such an outcome may only postpone the problem
2132401 while the forecast is controversial and extremely bullish even allowing for some increase in capacity over the next few years a supply crunch appears likely around 2013
2132402 once you know the gene thats responsible you can potentially figure out the proteins that are defective and possibly treat these patients
2132403 until you know what the defect is you cant devise any treatment once youve at least identified a defective gene you can work on potential treatments
2132404 the implications for dogs is that we have the possibility to reduce the frequency of this mutation in the population and in this way immediately avoid new cases of crd caused by this mutation
2132405 for humans the study may help in the identification of the etiology of some cases of crd and the dog could also be an extremely valuable model for the development of new treatment schemes for crd including gene therapy
2132406 in the future if they could use this model for gene therapy to see whether or not they can replace the gene product with a good protein that actually works in the retina and they can restore vision in this dachshund that would be helpful if we were to find same gene defect in humans that would be good news we could potentially use gene therapy in humans to restore vision
2132407 the cone cells are basically responsible for your very sharp central vision thats what allows you to read and see things far away and also provide you with color vision
2132408 the rods basically provide you with your peripheral or side vision and with your nighttime vision at night your cones dont work too well your rods are what enable you to get around in the dark
2132409 it may not be the same mechanism in humans but they think that it is
2132410 this is going to lead researchers in a direction where they know what to look for
2132411 this is a global market so it does have an impact
2132412 this is a pipeline that has not been attacked before to have it now politicized by the kurds opens up a whole new realm of political frustration and supply loss
2132413 that theres no significant follow through selling after going through some stops wednesday shows theres strength in the market
2132414 flows from the caspian play an important role in non opec supply growth this year given an increasingly deteriorating growth outlook for russia
2132415 the region is one of the fastest areas of crude supply growth
2132416 high crude oil prices and extreme volatility are causing demand destruction primarily in the u s if we get a period of stability around these numbers demand destruction will be limited
2132417 rising costs will drive government spending to unprecedented levels consume nearly all projected federal revenues and threaten americas future prosperity
2132418 last year we issued a funding warning and were doing so again this year
2132419 this will trigger and i want to emphasize again as secretary leavitt has said this will trigger a
2132420 enormous challenges unsustainable rapidly growing deficits mounting pressure savings rate has plummeted millions of americans individually at risk
2132421 i noted today in washington d c that the cherry blossoms are out they started to bloom today its part of natures rhythm and thats the way spring is in washington we see the cherry blossoms and hear medicare warnings the cherry blossoms go away and nothing happens with medicare
2132422 about 117 billion less than we felt it would be last summer
2132423 ive got to say that president bush is actually a very good fisherman

2132455 you lost five primaries and caucuses over the weekend youre not talking confidently about the next five you had to lend your campaign 5 million of your own money and your campaign manager just stepped down
2132456 what do you say to supporters who say this is not what a winning campaign looks like
2132457 i believe if you look at the states that are upcoming i am very confident i am absolutely looking to texas because we know that those are states where they represent the broad electorate in this country
2132458 senator obama suggested that the clintons already had their chance and that youre too polarizing
2132459 were they fights worth having yes they were so am i willing to lay down a lot of political capital and work my heart out to achieve universal health care yes i am
2132460 it doesnt look like theres a lot of redeeming qualities
2132461 dont tell me words dont matter i have a dream just words we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal just words we have nothing to fear but fear itself just words
2132462 i am not asking anybody to take a chance on me i am asking you to take a chance on your own aspirations
2132463 i am not asking anyone to take a chance on me i am asking you to take a chance on your own aspirations
2132464 you know those ads where people are running around the fields you know theyre smiling you dont know what the drug is for
2132465 i love the ads buy their medicine take it and the next day you and your spouse will be skipping through the fields
2132466 he did have an affair with 44 year old rielle hunter but said that he did not love her
2132467 we have good news for democracy the coalition believes it is imperative to move for impeachment against general musharraf
2132468 im a person who likes to be charitable but i dont usually give unless my own bills are paid and my basic needs are met
2132469 no one wants to see a household lose their home and repossession typically leads to a loss for the lender as well
2132470 the focus of lenders arrears management policies today is on seeking realistic alternatives that balance the interests of customer and lender
2132471 one year into the credit crunch the number of people being repossessed is rapidly rising with these figures showing the biggest increase in a half year period since 1996
2132472 with current fears that unemployment is set to grow there is no doubt we are inching ever closer to the dark days of the last repossession crisis
2132473 we know that behind these figures are thousands of families facing sleepless nights worrying about how to make their next mortgage payment and many thousands more will be waking up to the frightening reality of repossession
2132474 government urgently needs to step in to prevent thousands more families from losing their homes and provide the significant financial support troubled homeowners need to keep a roof over their head
2132475 the number of repossessions is rising but this should be put into perspective it starts from a very low base and the vast majority of mortgage holders are still paying their loans every month
2132476 im not sure theyre all equally striving hard for first place
2132477 ive never over all these years had any encounters with them in any way so in some ways the ferocity is shall i say a little surprising
2132478 because shes more conservative than he is i will campaign for her if its mccain
2132479 i can see possibly not voting for the republican nominee
2132480 i dont think that romneys going to succeed in getting to the right of me
2132481 the fact that you never tried to court these people suck up to them like romney did
2132482 i never would suck up the way all those other guys did those suck ups
2132483 the republican establishment which has long sought to rid the party of conservative influence since reagan is feeling a victory today as well as our friends in the media
2132484 the classic example of a fingerprint is an ink imprint showing the unique swirls and loops used for identification but fingerprints also leave behind a unique distribution of molecular compounds
2132485 some of the residues left behind are from naturally occurring compounds in the skin and some are from other surfaces or materials a person has touched
2132486 as expected falling equity markets and high levels of volatility have had a significant impact on retail investor demand and industry flows out of equity mutual funds continued in the second quarter
2132487 i saw firsthand all the greatest of the inaudible i wound up in inaudible but anyway i saw the inaudible
2132488 have you boxed yourself into a corner though by saying that the winner of florida will win the republican nomination
2132489 children with simple febrile seizures had a risk of death similar to the background population whereas those with complex febrile seizures febrile seizures triggered by a temperature below 39 degrees c and febrile seizures occurring before 12 months of age had a twofold higher mortality lasting for about two years the excess mortality was at least partly due to pre existing neurological abnormalities and subsequent epilepsy parents should be reassured that death after febrile seizures is very rare even in high risk children
2132490 the canadian economy is clearly downshifting in response to the downturn in the u s and the past run up in the canadian dollar
2132491 anyone reading the newspapers has been well aware of the flurry of plant closings and downsizing announcements and statistics canada surveys are finally catching up to that reality
2132492 canadians havent experienced job losses like this since 17 years ago when the country was in full recession
2132493 since this time last year weve lost another 88 000 manufacturing jobs now in the middle of the summer were seeing people give up on the job market altogether
2132494 with all signs pointing to a significant slowdown in the canadian housing market it is only a matter of time before construction hiring follows suit
2132495 next month will likely see a snapback after such a dramatic plunge in july and more large month to month swings cannot be ruled out
2132496 i dont think any of this is going to have an impact on his earmarks
2132497 he was going to go out in a blaze of glory
2132498 because the christian nation express is pulling out of the station
2132499 so keep fightin for freedom and justice beloveds but dont you forget to have fun doin it lord let your laughter ring forth be outrageous ridicule the fraidy cats rejoice in all the oddities that freedom can produce and when you get through kickin ass and celebratin the sheer joy of a good fight be sure to tell those who come after how much fun it was
2132500 i dont think any of this is going to have an impact on his earmarks
2132501 he was going to go out in a blaze of glory
2132502 because the christian nation express is pulling out of the station
2132503 so keep fightin for freedom and justice beloveds but dont you forget to have fun doin it lord let your laughter ring forth be outrageous ridicule the fraidy cats rejoice in all the oddities that freedom can produce and when you get through kickin ass and celebratin the sheer joy of a good fight be sure to tell those who come after how much fun it was
2132504 well but my affair is past the statute of limitations
2132505 how do you know whether it is a robust inspection force really uncovering the bad practices or whether restaurants in that city have poor health practices
2132506 the presence of rodents and insects is certainly disgusting and certainly shows a restaurant is not focusing on food safety
2132507 but the things most dangerous to consumers are the things we would never see unless we had the tools and the training even if we went into the kitchen we would not be able to see the things that would really harm us
2132508 the result in l a county has been a 20 reduction in food borne illness
2132509 right now a poor inspection is a hidden shame for a restaurateur with public grading food safety comes out of the shadows and becomes a priority for the restaurant the same way a four star rating from the zagat guide would be
2132510 ninety nine percent of critical violations are corrected before the inspector leaves the restaurant
2132511 whether it is a letter grade or some other method it needs to be standardized so it can be truly meaningful and inspectors need to be trained against those standards
2132512 and these standards should be based on the latest fda food code
2132513 every day 133 million americans eat away from home yet there is a very low number of reported food illness outbreaks from restaurants
2132514 the economy has some risks on both sides the risk of recession and the risk of inflation weve made the moves weve needed to make we will continue to monitor things to make sure that the outcome were planning on happens we think it might be a bumpy landing but were confident well be fine
2132515 this thing is going to land some day and we might be battered and bruised a bit but well land safely
2132516 im concerned about the inhumane slaughter and the use of downer sickly animals in our food chain
2132517 the global market for interchangeable lens type digital slr cameras is growing steadily but still only accounts for a 7 share of the total digital camera market
2132518 considering the much larger share held by interchangeable lens type slr camera systems when film was the dominant imaging medium it seems that there is still ample room for sales growth in the category
2132519 and the beast will come from a land called the u s of a and he will support the designated hitter rule and toyota in nascar
2132520 detroit sports fans should be reading out of bounds pretty much every day
2132521 coach if you want a messenger send for western union
2132522 well then id say youre due for a day off joe
2132523 just so you are not mistaken we dont make cakes we just like eating them
2132524 but we were shocked by the magnitude of the lies
2132525 the world will little note nor long remember what we say here while it can never forget what they did here
2132526 there is one sign the soviets can make that would be unmistakable that would advance dramatically the cause of freedom and peace general secretary gorbachev if you seek peace if you seek prosperity for the soviet union and eastern europe if you seek liberalization come here to this gate mr gorbachev open this gate mr gorbachev mr gorbachev tear down this wall
2132527 freedom is indivisible and when one man is enslaved all are not free
2132528 people of the world look at berlin where a wall came down a continent came together and history proved that there is no challenge too great for a world that stands as one the fall of the berlin wall brought new hope but that very closeness has given rise to new dangers dangers that cannot be contained within the borders of a country or by the distance of an ocean we cannot afford to be divided no one nation no matter how large or powerful can defeat such challenges alone none of us can deny these threats or escape responsibility in meeting them
2132529 theres no country that violates international law more than the us
2132530 were still the greatest nation in the world even with all our problems
2132531 ninety five per cent of the time he carries himself impressively the other five per cent embarassingly illustrates his inexperience
2132532 if you dont like this countrys stand on x or y then leave
2132533 dont complain about my comments if you dont like them just ignore them what happened to tolerance
2132534 there are ways to make your point and there are ways to make your point while insulting people
2132535 agreed easterner ill let the issue go but the fact is my last note to you 95 was bait i took your statement and blew it out of proportion with the intention of ridiculing you
2132536 im the glass is half full kind of person and youre the glass is half empty
2132537 but i also dont appreciate people bashing the us and the bush administration if youre so unhappy with this country than leave
2132538 repealed as of the date of enactment of this act
2132539 if only energy diversity were the real agenda of both parties it would be wonderful for the country
2132540 what we found is that neither of these popular and commonly used treatments offered a higher birth rate than no treatment at all
2132541 what weve shown is that neither of these first line treatments is better than the couples trying themselves
2132542 although it may seem a bit counterintuitive this is the one area of medicine where doing nothing could be as effective as going for any of these treatments
2132543 in the u s generally higher doses of clomid are used typically 100 milligrams a day
2132544 if anything the take home point from this study is in the group where they did insemination alone without any fertility drug there wasnt a significant increase in
2132545 if you have a patient with good results on the ovarian reserve testing then expectant management no treatment might be something the patient might desire
2132546 in the united states the indication of unexplained infertility is definitely managed more aggressively than it was in this study
2132547 usually after a year of trying and not succeeding the last thing a couple wants to hear is go home and try again
2132548 massively scalable real time ip video processing and collaboration platform
2132549 the dollar is strenghening across the board but its by default because were getting downside surprises on the economy in the uk and europe
2132550 britons have had the cash machines in their gardens taken away and weve got a consumer led slowdown
2132551 one question we are mulling is the closeness of the vote and whether there is still a significant danger of the committee raising rates especially as our forecasts show cpi inflation at 5pc in september
2132552 cup qualifying rained out at watkins glen busch on pole
2132553 yankee go home whos leading the anti war movement congressional republicans
2132554 the press vs al gore how lazy reporting pack journalism and gop spin cost him the election
2132555 i hope in the future nascar could tweak the rules where if they cancel qualifying and they know saturday might be better weather maybe they could lock the top 35 in but keep a half hour to go qualify the go or go homers
2132556 we put so much money into coming up here and not even to get a chance to qualify is a little disappointing
2132557 said loses money as qualifying rained out at watkins glen
2132558 et oui le monde nest pas dun cot tout noir et dun autre tout blanc
2132559 the fact that in a republican heartland like the falls road a clear majority of those polled said they did not believe in the inevitability of a united ireland should provide encouragement to the unionist community
2132560 they did not believe in the inevitability of a united ireland
2132561 university politics are so vicious precisely because the stakes are so small
2132562 anger is like drinking poison and waiting for someone else to die
2132563 this grand gala will act as a showcase of a 5 000 year old civilization
2132564 the coalition leaders believe that it has become imperative to move for impeachment
2132565 this person committed an oppression against pakistan thats why the parliament has decided to impeach him
2132566 if they are going to open up a new front then theyve raised stakes and all bets are off i dont think they would have control of the consequences of their own decisions theyre getting into something that they have no capacity to deal with
2132567 the army is totally out of politics and the americans are going to support democracy over any individual
2132568 the internal politics of pakistan is an issue for the pakistani people to decide our expectation is that any action will be consistent with the rule of law and the pakistani constitution it is the responsibility of pakistans leaders to decide on a way forward to succeed as a moderate modern and democratic country
2132569 we had such a fun time just like old times
2132570 i love him so much that i would ski naked down mount everest with a carnation up my nose if he asked me to
2132571 but it wasnt through running away i was going to cooperate
2132572 you can have my life story for twenty five thousand
2132573 the main reason for the armed resistance is the american military presence
2132574 if the american military begins to withdrawal there will be no need for these armed groups
2132575 an active sexual relationship between two people of the same sex might therefore reflect the love of god in a way comparable to marriage
2132576 the absolute condemnation of same sex relations of intimacy must rely either on an abstract fundamentalist deployment of a number of very ambiguous texts or on a problematic and non scriptural theory about natural complementarity applied narrowly and crudely to physical differentiation without regard to psychological structures
2132577 we would not be where were at it would either have nailed the problem or it would have caused a split very quickly hes delaying the inevitable
2132578 it was so great to see somebody cheering for somebody running
2132579 running is something we did all our lives it was our transportation
2132580 im here to inspire other kids who are out there watching these olympics
2132581 all of a sudden soldiers came in and told everyone to lay down
2132582 i witnessed a lot of kids go to sleep and never stand up again
2132583 it was one of those things well its his day today
2132584 i was writing in swahili and english and swahili and english
2132585 cold water hot water how to put it in the middle
2132586 the best way for us to make the chase is to remain consistent with our race car each and every race
2132587 its a tough battle right now for us to come out of pocono and gain two positions in the chase is a credit to team director kenny francis and all the guys that work on this budweiser dodge theres still a lot of racing left but last weekend was a good day for gillett evernham and all the guys that work on our team
2132588 the bonus points are going to be a pretty big deal
2132589 if you start 60 70 100 points ahead of the other guys it will be a great way to start the chase just being ahead will give you some breathing room
2132590 i have a few bonus points but i dont have enough we have to focus on doing all that we can to get more bonus points that will be pretty big heading into the chase
2132591 deep concerns over religious freedom and human rights the united states believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings
2132592 taking one step back against the arrogant powers will lead them to take one step forward
2132593 they lose sleep at night thinking that they rely on the middle east
2132594 the vital triangle china the united states and the middle east
2132595 while its often possible to minimize the potential impacts of a project or development like this i dont think thats achievable in this case
2132596 thats why ive taken the serious and unusual step of acting to rule this out completely
2132597 local government can only reject applications in the knowledge that if a developer suffers damage as a result of an adverse decision then council may have to compensate for that loss
2132598 i dont want to say anything bad about sydney or athens
2132599 theyre like hair wash next thing you know im getting a cut
2132600 great practice today man gosh im exhausted want to head down to the environmental information center to unwind
2132601 itll be a way better experience if youre not sloshed the whole time
2132602 in sydney people were out and about after midnight the entire time here theres nothing going on
2132603 and once im done ill be all over the place
2132604 being spanish is no longer an excuse its a responsibility
2132605 were seeing a moment in which the country has overcome its longstanding self perception in sports
2132606 before spaniards didnt see themselves as winners but as theyve won theyve gained confidence the spanish athlete now he believes hes a champion
2132607 rafael could have beaten federer last year and moved past him just as he could have lost to federer this year at wimbledon circumstances and details shape you and in a given competition shape the outcome
2132608 they really only existed in private schools they were for the elite
2132609 sports moved into the public schools and became something for everyone now its impossible to consider spanish society without sports
2132610 before youd only read about a few individual name athletes and our national teams were made up of these name players these little islands
2132611 despite the players regional differences because they knew how to integrate themselves
2132612 they feel like spaniards part of one country whether were talking about gasol nadal or sastre a national spirit leads them a spirit lacking before
2132613 this has enabled a professionalization of sports unthinkable two decades ago
2132614 and encouraged spaniards to see sports positively fathers want their sons to be soccer players
2132615 when my brother miguel ngel the soccer player won with barcelona
2132616 he was suddenly a star from a very small town manacor we had no champions but since then manacor has produced several champions in sports when those around you win more you start to believe in yourself that you can win too thats what happened with rafael hes had success because he has the mental attitude of a winner
2132617 rafael will pay a price for so many recent tournaments
2132618 but the olympics brings the best players and their high level of play brings out the best in you
2132619 theyre still trying to put sponsorship together for the 40 cup car but i dont know what will happen there right now its just about these nationwide races as far as next year i really i dont know i dont know if ill be racing in nascar or whether ill be racing in another series somewhere
2132620 it definitely wasnt ideal and its not a good feeling
2132621 its the first time its happened in my career but its just a sign of the times right now
2132622 i havent talked to anybody in the indycar series yet
2132623 franchitti mulling options would be interested in fourth rcr car
2132624 despite iraq earning billions of dollars in oil revenue in the past five years u s taxpayer money has been the overwhelming source of iraq reconstruction funds
2132625 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
2132626 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
2132627 we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank including outrageous profits from 4 a gallon gas prices in the u s we should require that u s taxpayers be reimbursed for the cost of large projects
2132628 yes its true that the iraqi government is spending little on reconstruction
2132629 the weak iraqi capability to do big projects maybe at the end of 2008 will improve
2132630 this has been an extremely hard decision for me to make
2132631 i have given everything i can to compete in this olympic games to get here and not be able to perform because of an injury is extremely disappointing but at the same time im a team player and im here to do everything i can to help this team succeed at the highest level
2132632 when i came to beijing my ankle was not 100
2132633 if organizing olympic games were a sport im sure youll agree with me that china would win the gold medal
2132634 that the friendship between france and china is a fundamental axis of frances foreign policy
2132635 to a china that succeeds more and more each day
2132636 i address a warm message of friendship an historic inalienable unshakable friendship that ties the french people to the chinese people
2132637 mohammed suleiman an officer in the syrian arab army has been assassinated
2132638 there is talk now about moving to direct peace negotiations between the syrians and israelis but its hard to reconcile those talks when syrias military and security apparatus is so heavily supported by iran
2132639 i cant imagine how they are going to square all that
2132640 its a very delicate question i think that how the regime reacts to the assassination will be more significant than the assassination itself
2132641 nearly every editor in chief is seeing the kind of declines that once would have gotten them fired
2132642 folklore tells us it is the childless couples or the women who want more children in the house who seek adoption
2132643 this tells us there is another face of adoption it is more complex than we had thought
2132644 weve seen an increase in same sex couples adopting and this is a trend all over the country
2132645 if you think about same sex couples gay men who want children really have to adopt but gay women can have their own children i dont see as many gay female couples adopting as gay male couples
2132646 it is not just white married couples who are adopting children
2132647 because the characteristics of children that women and couples seek to adopt may not correspond to the characteristics of children in the foster care system women and couples may seek children from outside the foster care system to adopt
2132648 adoption experiences of women and men and demand for children to adopt by women 18 44 years of age in the united states 2002
2132649 following todays press speculation wellcome trust confirms that it has acquired 39 35m shares equivalent to 2 5pc of the issued share capital of marks amp spencer in recent weeks this investment is part of wellcome trusts long term investment portfolio
2132650 9 5d but fit like 9d worn maybe 4 5 times so some sole wear but uppers in excellent shape no box
2132651 she has never been in any trouble besides this that doesnt mean she didnt do what was alleged
2132652 but she didnt get a fair trial and everyone has a right to a fair trial
2132653 id like to see her come out of there in a hearse
2132654 thats the way she should come out there dead you know not that we hate her or anything i hold no animosity against her but she took my dads life
2132655 the results havent been good but its all about expectations and they could have been much worse than what materialized
2132656 generally the banks that have done relatively well in maintaining profitability are not pure play investment banks
2132657 our conservative funding structure and our position as one of the worlds best capitalized banks remain competitive advantages
2132658 but the results so far are better than we were expecting
2132659 i think weve got to face the challenge that we didnt win today id like to think well see ourselves on film tonight and understand were not playing at the tempo that we accept
2132660 ya know im having trouble getting to my gym lately i wonder if there are body only fitness programs out there
2132661 i can give you all the tools all the science to get you in shape but all of that means nothing unless you do the work
2132662 my dear friend jaymes and i are so excited to announce the birth of parker foster aiken no hyphens one first name one middle name one last name
2132663 the little man is healthy happy and as loud as his daddy mama jaymes is doing quite well also the aiken family the foster family and the parker family are all thrilled
2132664 they dont speak they dont talk to their audience they may say hello new york or hello las vegas in the beginning and thank you in between songs but they dont talk they dont tell stories or take the time to make a connection build a rapport theres no emotion
2132665 we cant keep going back at it with pakistan cmon man where would that leave us
2132666 weve done war were in a different place now its not about india pakistan
2132667 its about india what can we do as a country what can we achieve
2132668 what do i care for pakistan we should all leave each other alone
2132669 we know the promise is weak but there is relatively little india can do short of military action and we do not have the stomach for that
2132670 danger is everywhere but i have to live my life
2132671 what are the chances that i will be killed i survived this time
2132672 what weve got is two different groups who are trying to do whats best and offering value for their customers
2132673 the games for windows team and the games for windows live team looked at this and said what do we need to do to make sure this adopted broadly and has value
2132674 and thats all those changes the ui the marketplace the fact that were not going to have the same content on xbox live i think theyve done everything to continue to add value to the gold subscription
2132675 so those services will evolve in different directions youll have different types of content that we offer
2132676 polling places in shelby county will be open today from 7 a m to 7 p m for state and federal primaries and county general elections
2132677 also voters will decide the fate of two sets of amendments to the shelby county charter and will vote yes or no to retain seven state appeals court judges the county general election ballot features races for assessor trustee general sessions court clerk and criminal court judge division 6
2132678 to run out of the pregame tunnel into a full stadium in the big ten conference
2132679 well that has to be a dream for every little kid who ever plays football
2132680 i took a week out of my summer to go see the schools and to really concentrate on this because i know how big of a decision it is and how it will impact the rest of my life
2132681 it is such a big weight off my shoulders to have this off my mind is a huge thing because now i can concentrate on this year and this year i really think we have a team that can win a state championship
2132682 smith runs an amazing program and we are all definitely more prepared for a college program because of it
2132683 when a college coach recruits a player from gateway he knows that player is organized and has a great understanding of technique and all the parts of the game because they played under coach smith and the gateway staff
2132684 it has been tough at times with him as it has been with all of our kids to reinforce that work ethic that we are trying to instill
2132685 but he is improving every single day he is seeing that he hasnt even tapped into his full capabilities yet and i think that is pushing him and motivating him a lot right now
2132686 indiana is going to get a football player who if he keeps realizing that he needs to work hard can be very good
2132687 that is just how it is with football and it will kind of always be that way i guess
2132688 but it doesnt bother me because everyone who plays knows how important the line play is we know that we get the recognition that we need from the people who matter most and that is the guys whom we are blocking for
2132689 they expect me to redshirt definitely when i get there that first year
2132690 i see that as a positive that way i will bulk up some and get to know the system
2132691 we get together right after the fourth and start weightlifting and conditioning drills
2132692 we want them to be in good condition when camp starts because when you get to that point you dont want to have to spend a lot of time on conditioning getting your timing down is another big part of it
2132693 we think its important for our kids to be involved in other sports
2132694 we dont want to take them away from those things and we understand they have summer jobs you cant force them to give those things up
2132695 in the case of other sports we want our kids to play some of our best defensive backs over the years have been baseball players they learn to get a jump on the ball and that helps with their anticipation on plays in football
2132696 our motto this year is to be fast and physical
2132697 when we started we were pretty far behind a lot of the teams we were playing in terms of strength and speed
2132698 i think these programs have helped us close the gap a little bit
2132699 i really believe that speed kills the difference between most division i and division ii and iii players comes down to speed speed can make up for a lot of mistakes and if you dont have it your mistakes are amplified
2132700 we used to think that some kids were fast and some kids were slow and thats the way you were going to be
2132701 but it has been proven over the years that you can improve your speed we do a lot of work in that area
2132702 its a good opportunity for the freshmen to get familiar with the program and its good for flexibility and agility
2132703 you work with your backs and receivers on skill and agility with linemen footwork is the big thing you also get an opportunity to teach linemen how to use their hands a little better
2132704 they all work the techniques to improve their speed they all want to move up to that next level
2132705 the workouts are a chance to get to work on certain things so that when you get to camp you dont have to rush
2132706 i think since there is no hitting your skill guys probably get the most benefit but it helps the linemen improve their agility and footwork too its a chance to get guys to refine their techniques and as a coaching staff it gives us a chance to implement some new things and maybe experiment a little bit
2132707 we have kids who miss some of them when they do theyre usually behind a little when it comes to schemes and techniques but the kids end up playing these workouts are important but they are not the be all and end all for most of the kids they catch up
2132708 for us its a good chance for the freshmen to get oriented in our program
2132709 they get a chance to improve their strength and flexibility and to get acclimated to the coaches
2132710 were not going to deny someone the right to play if they miss the workouts but there is no doubt it makes it harder for those players in camp when camp starts we start doing things as a coaching staff that we assume everyone knows its tougher for the kids who miss summer workouts to catch up but if theyre good players theyll catch up pretty quick
2132711 i dont know of anyone ive ever talked to even some of the better players who enjoys practice the games are fun but practice is hard and we are really asking a lot of these kids in terms of a commitment
2132712 the goal is to get the kids into condition lifting wise and from a strength and conditioning standpoint to prepare them for training camp
2132713 training camp is tough we get involved in the passing camps and that kind of thing too to try to get them ready
2132714 i think to be honest were all getting to the point of overkill playing high school football nowadays takes a tremendous amount of time and commitment from the players and the coaches
2132715 he played an instrumental vital part in the philadelphia rock scene
2132716 going to see this band that i had heard about called robert hazard and the heroes
2132717 and they just ripped it up they were all dressed in black with red accents it was a macho stripped down lean mean attack machine
2132718 they were playing their tight and solid new wave rock with the musicians in line behind their fearless leader and rocking the hell out of the downtown crowd
2132719 theyd move back and forth as a unit raising the energy of the crowd with each and every step it was a talented group of players and roberts songs and stage presence were not to be denied
2132720 i didnt really play guitar till much later in my teens i would audition at coffee houses like the second of autumn and the edge
2132721 i never got a job but learned about acoustic music by hanging out at these places listening to eric andersen chris smither jimmy webb and other great songwriters and poet guitar players
2132722 fought this dichotomy he was known for one thing but that was really not his essence his soul he was a folky rootsy guy
2132723 the stripped down acoustic concerts i did with my buddy michael pilla i thought these were the most rewarding and the most appreciated by my audience
2132724 we went to africa the whole experience was life altering for me
2132725 we do not plan to reissue packaging but will offer a free downloadable cover in the coming days on easports com featuring brett favre in a jets uniform
2132726 fans can print this new cover out and insert it into the case of madden nfl 09
2132727 in almost 20 years as a prosecutor and now as attorney general i cannot recall one case where someone has assaulted a police officer who was attempting to serve a subpoena
2132728 were going to fight there the same way as we fought it here the law and common sense
2132729 a judge who makes some basic rules from the beginning expects those rules to be followed
2132730 we did it at the hands of sheriffs deputies who burst through our front door rifles blazing
2132731 this was not a failed operation as part of our continuing investigation into drug trafficking
2132732 the community is damaged by the continuous drug trafficking but of course we understand the pain and suffering by the loss of our beloved pets we dont want any of our operations to result in the injury or loss of anybody and certainly not animals we understand and we wish that this situation would not have occurred
2132733 the door flew open i heard gunfire shoot off there was a brief pause and more gunfire
2132734 i noticed my two dead dogs lying in pools of their own blood
2132735 it was that lack of communication that really led to what has really been the most traumatic experience of our lives
2132736 theyve arrested the real criminals involved were pleased to have that and get our name back as well but really this doesnt excuse what they did
2132737 we did not feel safe with her acting that way
2132738 i think it would be premature to jump out there and say exactly what may have happened
2132739 we know one contributing factor would be that it appears that a right tire on the tour bus had a blowout and that certainly contributed to the accident
2132740 theyre willing to kill anybody who gets in their way
2132741 people who farm now are not doing this for laughs despite the fact hollywood still thinks that theyre doing it to make a lot of money
2132742 theyre willing to kill anybody who gets in their way theyre taking money back to those who kill prosecutors judges and law enforcement
2132743 they come into our own national parks and risk the lives of sheriffs and others
2132744 theyre using family or very trusted family friends they dont just use anybody
2132745 youre recruited in for that purpose as long as youre trusted each person has his function
2132746 the people that are growing this are good at what they do
2132747 the goal is not just to eradicate the plants but to go after the organizations
2132748 in the past all weve been able to do is what we call whack and stack
2132749 were not just pulling the plants were targeting mid level and upper management of these trafficking organizations
2132750 often times we have people who will lead us to these gardens
2132751 i want to state that the guys growing the marijuana are not the guys i went to college with
2132752 its something thats troubling for many of us in law enforcement
2132753 you have illegal criminal activity in the mountain regions not only destroying the natural beauty of the landscape but as well as the potential for this product to reach the children of this community
2132754 why do i need a dvr expander when ive got an unused external pc hard drive couldnt i just plug it into the dvrs usb port
2132755 renewable energy to transform our economy create jobs and energy independence thats john mccain
2132756 it means that they dont want to tell people what that means
2132757 he really needs to fill in with specifics like what energy sources should be stimulated what are his goals what mix would he want to see by what timeframe
2132758 wind energy could produce 20 percent of u s electricity by 2030

2132772 n gatif pour les salari s comme pour les entreprises
2132773 sont plut t positives mais elles noccultent pas le reste des dispositions sur le temps de travail qui vont largement nuire aux conditions de travail et aux conditions de vie des salari s
2132774 on saura mobiliser tous les moyens juridiques et les moyens syndicaux pour combattre ces mesures
2132775 le conseil constitutionnel rappelle au l gislateur son obligation de d terminer des garanties minimales pour les salari s
2132776 pour autant les dispositions en mati re de temps de travail restent toujours socialement r gressives
2132777 ces censures constituent un s rieux camouflet pour le gouvernement

2132781 morgan was like thats what we need to do mommy
2132782 i dont think its going to be something thats just going to stop
2132783 she was a very sensitive young lady to begin with and she always wants to help
2132784 my big thing to her is you dont have to be a big person to make a difference
2132785 it just rips your heart out to think of all theyve been through
2132786 my first year down there thats when it really grabbed me i saw these kids and i wanted to help
2132787 its quite an honor i just love doing everything i can to help these kids
2132788 he always had this little mischievous grin on him and a little twinkle in his eyes that always made you wonder what he was up to
2132789 he was a very curious energetic young man he was very athletic and i would say that he was a little more of a risk taker especially on the playground
2132790 he looked like an athlete even at that age he didnt have to do any extra laps for shenanigans
2132791 he stood out as a kid that had a lot of potential
2132792 that is his blood im amazed that this is here
2132793 to think that a family kept that and preserved it im glad that they did
2132794 to grow up in bloomfield go to high school in this dinky town and now be four feet from lincoln his blood or dna its really moving
2132795 we saw the original lincoln life mask in washington d c
2132796 we did the booth escape tour that starts at fords theater and goes down to fredericksburg where he was killed
2132797 we saw the contents of lincolns pockets when he was killed whatever lincoln papers are not in springfield ill are at the library of congress even with all that they did not tell us anything about this flag
2132798 im kind of in awe that thats the blood of abraham lincoln and i can still see it
2132799 im just amazed ive never heard of it i dont think its very well known
2132800 it brings us history as close as we can get to abraham lincoln
2132801 his lincolns face is so familiar but that flags very rare we went to gettysburg i had to know where he stood
2132802 the life he led how he taught himself to read cared so much for his country
2132803 americans began thinking of themselves as americans after the civil war
2132804 we have a huge and unprecedented opportunity to observe a large reduction in everyday emissions from a region thats very industrially active
2132805 by determining the effects of soot reductions during the olympics on atmospheric heating we can gain much needed insights into the magnitude of future global warming
2132806 these technologies will provide new estimates of solar irradiance aerosol cloud interactions climate forcing and important components of the biogeochemical cycles of the east asian and western pacific ocean region
2132807 gt hillary brown of bloomfield pauses for a photo outside of the east bloomfield historical society yesterday
2132808 i was completely blown away with the quality of that production
2132809 she was graduating preparing for college but she lives near the park and the civil war monument she took the project and ran with it
2132810 i was so creatively dry for so long my last weekend before the deadline i looked out the window and i live next to elton park
2132811 its mostly composed of speeches theres a narrator who walks around
2132812 im terrified i know hes lincoln re enactor michael krebs not really abraham lincoln really but hes 6 foot 4 im 5 foot 2 im going to have to bring a step ladder
2132813 to have him ripped out of the world was extremely tragic
2132814 lincoln makes an appearance later in the play after his death in contemporary theater the audience wouldnt question his coming back
2132815 im extremely glad it is historically accurate and we did not have to change anything its your baby and you dont want to change it
2132816 i liked to write plays starting in second grade stories about monsters princes and princesses i love it so much maybe i should do it
2132817 how lovely on the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news who announces peace and brings good news of happiness who announces salvation and says to zion your god reigns
2132818 how then will they call on him in whom they have not believed how will they believe in him whom they have not heard and how will they hear without a preacher how will they preach unless they are sent just as it is written
2132819 basically i picked msu because ive always wanted to go here
2132820 when we purchased doubleclick we talked about how we would empower agencies advertisers and publishers to collaborate more efficiently and effectively and provide a better experience for our users
2132821 we are happy that we have been able to deliver on this promise already like support for third party vendors on the google content network
2132822 were pleased with some of the progress weve seen on churn
2132823 we still have a ton of work to do there
2132824 but you cant cross finish line unless you have the secret number
2132825 in all likelihood this issue will escalate and i understand could result in wto action focused specifically on how the u s government enforces its laws i cannot see how that can be in the interests of this country
2132826 foreign operators who respected congressional intent in 2006 and withdrew from the market while u s companies continue to operate uninterrupted
2132827 that will expand but its hard to do here because we dont have a system of royalty rates
2132828 the problem is when you sit down with them all of a sudden their great desire to pay the artists seems to evaporate
2132829 we dont like the result of services we asked you to set up
2132830 the riaa has taken its lumps but is not getting its kudos
2132831 its harder and easier to be a musician these days
2132832 role in this is worthy of a multi hour discussion
2132833 we have to make sure isps have an incentive to innovate
2132834 be careful before you legislate away their incentive for business development
2132835 the keyword is survival we are married to technology and technology does drive a lot of the decisions
2132836 they were so excited theyre rvers so they can go anywhere on the road find a computer go into the download a book and play it while they drive down the highway
2132837 we also know we are touching only a small percentage of each librarys patrons
2132838 its a like this nice secret that we of course dont want to be kept secret
2132839 material that doesnt take up shelf space and is available 24 7 thats really attractive for libraries
2132840 these arent activists theyre not protesters these are people intent on coming to events to offices to peoples residences and theyre intent on breaking the law
2132841 well what hes doing is a workshop theres not going to be any trashing of any premiers offices in bella coola as far as i know its a workshop its educational and yes it is political and people have a right to be political people who have been convicted of drunk driving can be in politics so to suggest thomas should not be allowed to discuss the things he has experience with i think would be a silly argument
2132842 the official position that waterboarding is not torture or our official position that its a thrill ride
2132843 its highly unlikely that those air defense missiles would be in iranian hands any time soon
2132844 its highly unlikely would be in iranian hands any time soon
2132845 i am sure a lot more people would like to buy it but currently cant do so the app is a work of art and included a secret mantra thats all

2132847 he was a great influence because he was always calm there was nothing he couldnt handle
2132848 no one at our firm knew better how to engender and reciprocate the type of loyalty and dedication that bill had with his clients
2132849 he wasnt the stereotypical tax lawyer either he was outgoing brilliant iconoclastic and collegial a potent combination of qualities that earned him the respect of all of his colleagues we are going to miss him terribly
2132850 the firm had a wonderful non retirement party for him in june
2132851 thank you god you are a god who knows me and wouldnt choose to ask of me in a place that is unfamiliar instead you have come to me in my familiar place and have asked me to be myself away with the christian language away with storage of biblical knowledge away with fabrication and expectations that dont fit me you have given me new life and i rejoice in who you have called me to be
2132852 the vice president looks forward to participating in the republican national convention and continuing to work for the election of sen mccain and other republican candidates in the coming months
2132853 given the potentially huge lead in of the super bowl champions taking on a division rival from two of the largest tv markets in the u s it could only benefit the campaign
2132854 but like i said i still like the comedy being offered at the ucb and the pit im afraid hipsters might ruin comedy
2132855 i dont need polaroids from some delusional larry clark wannabe to indulge my fantasies of rejection
2132856 colony development partners currently has five commercial projects under construction in north carolina tennessee and texas and expects to start five more before year end
2132857 our office and health care project pipeline is substantial so we are working with several large equity funds to boost our ability to handle the project volume
2132858 be accepting of different people and let people be who they are you know how many people came to me calling me gay cause i wear my jeans the fresh way
2132859 coming from chicago where if you saw somebody that was gay you were supposed to stay ten feet away
2132860 it took me time to break out of the mental prisons i was in the stereotypes of the fear of the backlash that i would get if you dont believe what i believe in accepting people for who they are
2132861 i will try to serve you with dignity and honesty just like we ran this campaign
2132862 roe ran a grassroots campaign that challenged the status quo and put people before politics there is no doubt that he will be the next representative for tennessees 1st district
2132863 i think we won the republican primary with republican primary voters yesterday i think he ultimately won the election with democrat switchover vote
2132864 these incendiary and personal attacks have no place in our politics and will do nothing to help the good people of tennessee
2132865 it is our mission at dhs to support and protect vulnerable children
2132866 i intend to hold every staff member and provider accountable for upholding that mission
2132867 i am a youth leader engaged in the fight against hiv aids

2132871 55 year old nevers intimidated starbucks employees by screaming at them and flashing her badge handcuffs or gun when they wanted her to pay

2132873 remember you are someones impression of what all law enforcement officers are
2132874 we have to improve on last season especially away from home i want us to be tougher and nastier on our travels
2132875 the evidence satisfies williams has failed to attend to his contractual responsibilities
2132876 there have been numerous attempts to distract the game from the fundamental issue which is that a contract is a binding commitment on the part of both the player and the club
2132877 it protects both parties and places responsibilities on both parties
2132878 the issuing of a nsw supreme court order in respect of those responsibilities should provide a stark reminder to sonny bill of the importance of him observing the terms of his contract
2132879 it is a very serious matter for such an order to be granted and anyone who breaks an order of the nsw supreme court would face contempt proceedings from that court
2132880 if we werent sweating enough with the heat were definitely sweating buckets now

2132882 ces modalit s correspondent celles que le gouvernement entendait fixer par voie r glementaire
2132883 que cette atteinte aux conventions existantes n tait pas justifi e par un motif dint r t g n ral suffisant
2132884 les parties aux conventions pouvaient ren gocier celles ci d s la publication de la loi en les d non ant

2132914 as athletes we need to send the message to the khartoum government not to kill or bomb and to china to stop because those guns are not to defend the country but to kill innocent people
2132915 no one shall be held in slavery or servitude slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms
2132916 when you hape people running around buying up slaves you help create a market demand for more slaves its like paying the burglar for the television set he just stole the slave traders end up with more money buying more guns and hiring more thugs to go out and take more slaves
2132917 our overall strategy continues to be to strengthen our position in the affinity based segment of the subscription driven dating market
2132918 over the past five quarters weve been focused on increasing stockholder value and return by growing our other affinity networks segment maximizing the yield from our jewish networks optimizing our marketing spend adding an advertising revenue stream reducing overhead and prudently allocating capital
2132919 this strategy has translated into increased profitability and cash flow in the second quarter adjusted ebitda 1 excluding currency translation adjustments was 4 4 million or a 29 margin cash flow was 4 2 million a 19 increase over the same period last year and a 43 sequential increase

2132949 we have to change our tactics and think out of the box
2132950 prevention should be priority number one priority number two and priority number three
2132951 africa has lacked visible leadership on hiv aids we hope this will change with the champions initiative
2132952 my own country sa was mired in the gruesome nightmare of president thabo mbekis aids denialism
2132953 every little bit helps festus mogae knows how the systems work and understands the african union and southern african development community
2132954 africa has burst into this whole frenetic spasm of criminalising hiv
2132955 criminal law is simply the wrong framework for dealing with hiv transmission
2132956 everywhere it has been tried it has been counterproductive and applied unjustly
2132957 if it is biased then why do you even read it
2132958 well kill you if you break our precious laws even if we have to break our own laws in the process
2132959 the council concluded it was at a stalemate after the united states britain and some other members backed the georgians in rejecting a phrase in the three sentence draft statement that would have required both sides
2132960 who is the real president and in charge of russia
2132961 at no point was the public ever in danger the company said
2132962 since there is no way to defend the use of animal model systems in plain english or with scientific facts they resort to double talk in technical jargon the virtue of animal model systems to those in hot pursuit of the federal dollars is that they can be used to prove anything no matter how foolish or false or dangerous this might be there is such a wide variation in the results of animal model systems that there is always some system which will prove a point the moral is that animal model systems not only kill animals they also kill humans there is no good factual evidence to show that the use of animals in cancer research has led to the prevention or cure of a single human cancer
2132963 normally animal experiments not only fail to contribute to the safety of medications but they even have the opposite effect
2132964 giving cancer to laboratory animals has not and will not help us to understand the disease or to treat those persons suffering from it
2132965 everyone should know that most cancer research is largely a fraud and that the major cancer research organisations are derelict in their duties to the people who support them
2132966 my own conviction is that the study of human physiology by way of experimenting on animals is the most grotesque and fantastic error ever committed in the whole range of human intellectual activity
2132967 animal model systems differ from their human counterparts conclusions drawn from animal research when applied to human beings are likely to delay progress mislead and do harm to the patient vivisection or animal experimentation should be abolished
2132968 i am very excited to be part of the denver regional census office and again part of the census 2010
2132969 my position as a state of nevada partnership specialist will give me the opportunity to create partnerships with national umbrella governmental and nongovernmental organizations state local and tribal governments and community groups
2132970 the majority of global companies surveyed acknowlege significant deficiencies in their go to market capabilities and marketing and sales processes

2132981 understanding and minimizing quality deterioration is critical for manufacturers as it is a key driver of owner satisfaction and word of mouth recommendations
2132982 additional focus on these issues prior to vehicle launch would benefit not only consumers but also automakers through increased customer satisfaction
2132983 but this helps me to exercise my mind for my studies

2132985 prescribers should be aware of the increased risk ofrhabdomyolysis when simvastatin is prescribed with amiodarone and they should avoid doses of simvastatin greater than 20 mgper day in patients taking amiodarone
2132986 summerer we have a job for you but there is no job description
2132987 this is something totally new for us but you have experience with athletes you can do that
2132988 we started out with good intentions and trust in god and it went well
2132989 we had happy games until the terrorist attack happened from one moment to the next everything changed before the bloodshed people would stroll all around the campus and hook up with other athletes after the attack everything went downhill
2132990 one should never say never but i sincerely hope that never again anything similar will taint the olympic games which are supposed to bring people from all over the world together in a spirit of friendship
2132991 lets hope and pray that peace will prevail in china and that this spirit will overcome political cultural and religious differences not only during the event but also after the olympic flame is extinguished
2132992 in a way i can understand the athletes who use performance enhancing drugs yet in another way i cannot
2132993 it is sad to see that nowadays people and maybe more officials and doctors than the athletes themselves think they can challenge god
2132994 i always tried to tell competitors be yourself and show the spectators and god what you can do dont try to make yourself into somebody else by using drugs
2132995 the hardest job for me was always to console an athlete who was knocked out of competition by an illness or injury and forced into the role of spectator and this after he or she had prepared for months to participate in the olympic games
2132996 the organ and its music helped to create some common ground among people who were speaking so many different languages
2132997 our government is determined to give the canadian forces the tools that they need to do the important work that we ask of them
2132998 our canadian forces have been in the unfortunate position of not having any other option than hitchhiking rides with allies to move personnel in countries like afghanistan
2132999 did you buy me a drink then why are you talking to me
2133000 what did you step out of an 80s time machine with that hair cut
2133001 barack obama never defended congressman stephen cohen from the black racists and anti semites of memphis
2133002 most of the poker rake is generated by the high stakes players and we have taken the decision to offer them us liquidity from those individual states where there is less of a legal risk
2133003 my dear friend jaymes and i are so excited to announce the birth of parker foster aiken no hyphens
2133004 the little man is healthy happy and as loud as his daddy mama jaymes is doing quite well also
2133005 she wore a traditional wedding gown while ty wore his favorite blue jeans white shirt and cowboy hat
2133006 the couple is very happy and look forward to enjoying their honeymoon
2133007 we dont know if theres a point weve lapped our friends whove gotten married and divorced
2133008 we probably would if we had kids were just not sure we want them yet but weve had something really special already
2133009 to all the girls out there who think being funny is not sexy you are wrong
2133010 i never have actually had a girl whos made me laugh before
2133011 no im really looking forward to it i have a really really great girl in my life right now
2133012 i have a necklace around my neck that my lady gave me
2133013 im more important than you but not as important as aug 8th 2008 2 55pm
2133014 i asked mike dollard victor finance director to find another source of funds for this i did that on leslie bamanns behalf i felt it needed to be done
2133015 its up to the board there are a couple of options
2133016 the towns share is 78 percent and that on the surface does not seem appropriate
2133017 at least look at this again and see how it is proportioned
2133018 if we had no sexual harassment we would have no children
2133019 drug disasters are literally built into the current system of drug testing and approvals in the united states
2133020 a new study suggests that the huge volume of uninsured and underinsured people may be seriously cutting into drugmakers sales
2133021 but colleen why do you need so many different compost systems wouldnt one do well enough and be less complicated
2133022 the court basically told the city that if thats all it has it cant take these homes
2133023 its too late for the city to manufacture more evidence so the courts ruling is a fatal blow to the city we are confident the owners will prevail on remand
2133024 we agree with appellants that in light of the principles laid down in gallenthin the city did not find actual blight under any subsection of n j s a 40a 12a 5 that the record lacked substantial evidence that could have supported the new jersey constitutions standard for finding blight and that the absence of substantial evidence of blight compels reversal
2133025 this victory for the long branch homeowners is a victory for property owners across the garden state sending a clear message that abusers of eminent domain will be held accountable
2133026 this obviously shows that something wasnt done right its vindication
2133027 new jersey courts understand that blight and redevelopment are often merely smokescreens for taking valuable property from people of modest means and giving it to rich and powerful developers
2133028 our long awaited trial will expose the citys eminent domain abuse as the sham it is
2133029 i have a dream that is deeply rooted in the american dream i have a dream that one day america will live out the full meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
2133030 the canadian economy is clearly downshifting in response to the downturn in the u s and the past run up in the canadian dollar
2133031 anyone reading the newspapers has been well aware of the flurry of plant closings and downsizing announcements and statistics canada surveys are finally catching up to that reality
2133032 canadians havent experienced job losses like this since 17 years ago when the country was in full recession
2133033 since this time last year weve lost another 88 000 manufacturing jobs now in the middle of the summer were seeing people give up on the job market altogether
2133034 with all signs pointing to a significant slowdown in the canadian housing market it is only a matter of time before construction hiring follows suit
2133035 from this perspective it can be entirely rational and proper for a government to select among two competing growth strategies the one that has greater potential payoff for the poor even if the aggregate growth impact is less assured
2133036 we had a better quarter when compared to the same period last year with sales up 3 5 per cent and earnings before items increasing 23 million despite a 5 9 per cent drop in paper shipments
2133037 clearly the synergies are starting to show in our results and the projected benefits from new initiatives have led us to increase our synergy target to 250 million
2133038 it is categorically untrue that loreal paris altered ms knowles features or skin tone in the campaign for feria hair color
2133039 if indiana jones wasnt in it youd have to call it mutt williams and the search for elvis
2133040 the franchise really depends on me coming up with a good idea
2133041 colony development partners currently has five commercial projects under construction in north carolina tennessee and texas and expects to start five more before year end
2133042 our office and health care project pipeline is substantial so we are working with several large equity funds to boost our ability to handle the project volume
2133043 que atraviesa el sector y en este sentido indica que si la actividad continua igual y no se logra dar un impulso al sector el a o se cerrar con crecimientos negativos superiores al 15
2133044 dif cilmente te otorgan una licencia de obra en menos de ocho meses cuando por ley deber an d rtela en tres meses

2133051 hes lazy and hes got a bit of a temper on him hes not funny hes not entertaining and hes lazy so why the f is he still in the house i dont understand
2133052 i still dont agree with how he spoke to housemates when we were picking head of house and he snapped and started kicking off with everyone i completely disagree with how he spoke to people
2133053 stuarts been hinting to everyone in the house that he wants to go home and i do feel its sort of like hes been putting pressure on all of us to nominate him
2133054 he doesnt really join in much with the group discussions and he goes to bed early pretty much every night he doesnt really contribute that much compared with everyone else
2133055 i know he really wants to go and i feel so bad saying this because i really get along with him but he doesnt let me kat and rachel sing he just hates our singing and he goes on about it all the time
2133056 academic medical centers should make clear that participation by their faculty in industry sponsored speakers bureaus should be strongly discouraged

2133059 sort of trivial nothing out of the ordinary but look at all the people ive met i tried to do a good job you might say ive enjoyed it
2133060 very simple he wasnt much into himself or money or vacations
2133061 he loved his family he loved his wife he loved his country of course he could never talk enough about his job
2133062 he was a man who lived simply but loved greatly
2133063 gatverdamme was het maar over ik voel me zo klote

2133070 charity days allows us to give back to the local communities we serve and enables us to support a wide range of worthy and important causes
2133071 by providing non profits with the opportunity to select free merchandise from our clearance section we are giving them the chance to stock up on those much needed items for fundraisers and charity events this is an occasion we look forward to every year and we encourage all area non profits to take advantage of this annual event
2133072 these will be very popular for birthday parties field trips school outings and for a beat the heat summer outing
2133073 the renewable energy trust is pleased to support this and other feasibility studies for companies interested in rehabilitating existing dams
2133074 hydroelectric power is an important part of the commonwealths clean energy supply and these rehabilitations can be a great opportunity for businesses
2133075 someone should have told me that my children were dying from aids
2133076 i could have taken precaution while i cared for them during their illness i could have avoided exposing myself to the virus now who will care for me when i eventually fall ill from aids who will care for my orphaned grandchildren when i die from this disease
2133077 it is based on the belief that it is important to maintain confidentiality about health matters of patients if their trust or confidence is to be gained for full disclosure and proper treatment of ailments
2133078 if doctor patient confidentiality is breached then patients will simply stop seeking medical help and that becomes too dangerous
2133079 disclosure of hiv status is a double edged sword in a society like ours where stigma is rife whose rights become paramount here the patient the spouse partner or other such people providing care for the sick
2133080 we have evidence of violence on women who tested hiv before their husbands
2133081 disclosure to their husbands led to violence being perpetrated by the same husbands women are usually the first to know their status through ante natal clinic visits they are then chased away from their matrimonial home by angry husbands under these conditions of discrimination should we allow medical personnel to disclose hiv to partners without causing risk to their clients it is a dilemma facing the nation but it is time we started debating these issues and coming out with the way forward
2133082 untenable because to which of the clients multiple partners would the doctor disclose hiv status
2133083 you are assuming partners also visit the same practitioner which is wrong they may not even live in the same place
2133084 most hiv infections are through sex which is a conscious decision that individuals take one actually takes the initiative to have sex and so takes responsibility to know the hiv status of the person one is having sex with why must we burden health personnel with the obligation of disclosing bens hiv status to sibongile she should have found out herself before she even married him
2133085 men are the major drivers of hiv in the southern africa region and the challenge is for them to be encouraged to get tested for hiv instead of the current scenario where the woman gets to know her status first either through ante natal clinic visits or illness
2133086 the dilemma is that if we are going to protect the hiv infected from stigma by not disclosing their status how do we protect the care giver who is at a high risk from hiv infection because of contact with the body fluids of the sick patients they care for
2133087 for as long as we continue to hide behind the finger of confidentiality we will wipe out the care giver population because no one has told them to protect themselves from hiv infection caregivers should be informed in such a manner that they also do not discriminate or stigmatise the patient
2133088 thank you for bringing children from the streets to have a home we need more of people like you to give children hope
2133089 it doesnt matter where you are coming from where you are going is what matters the sky should be the limit
2133090 the care action programme is designed as a long term project to assist zimbabwe a total of seven companies have pledged to assist in orphanages homes as well as schools in the country as a way of giving back to the community
2133091 the care action is a further step for us in implementing the spirit of china africa co operation where companies undertake to respond to the urgent need of assistance as part of their social responsibility
2133092 the problem with abstinence as a means of hiv aids prevention is found in the fact that many people are not willing to abstain from sex even at the risk of acquiring the disease this is more in the case of young men and women who are more energetic and more prone to experimentation than the adult population who are somehow settled in their sex habits and are often very self regulatory in their behaviours
2133093 the youths especially the adolescents who often get excited about sex throw caution overboard taking risk in sexual behaviour that are detrimental to their health and are unhelpful in the prevention of hiv aids
2133094 the situation has gotten so bad today that some women cannot have unprotected sex with their husbands militating against child bearing happiness and trust in the home in some families some spouses nurse the same fear for their partners as they would have for commercial sex workers
2133095 some of these women complain bitterly that they married their husbands as virgins stayed faithful through their married years only to be given the gift of hiv aids by their husbands the worse cases is that some of these men on discovering they are positive hide it from their wives and start going for antiretroviral treatment leaving their wives to suffer until they have full blown aids this is a double stab because while they live on the women die and in some instances the men despite knowing their status go ahead to breed infected children instead of informing their families and taking necessary steps to protect mother and child cases abound where a man falls ill and dies only for his widows and orphans to discover months or years later what killed him when they start having the symptoms or test positive to the disease they just dont battle to fend for themselves alone any more they have to fight the disease which may have gone to a very advanced stage then leading to more avoidable deaths if only they had been faithful or opened to their families no matter how devastating the revelation might be to them

2133099 this partnership represents an opportunity to continue our strong relationship with aca and the bombardier lake louise winterstart providing our high quality products and contributing to acas vision of being the best
2133100 the partnership with mr lacha ne and the experienced team at skicatalogue com provide the tools and equipment for alpine canada alpin to organize the best ski races in the world
2133101 corporate canada is beginning to think the worst and the result has been a summer crop of pink slips
2133102 the jobs trend is consistent with weak positive growth at best and our call for a roughly one per cent gain in real output is in line with that reality and perhaps a tad optimistic
2133103 we have asked the national team to release them and arranged an immediate flight back so they can prepare for the first leg against fenerbahce on wednesday
2133104 we really want serbia to do well in the olympic games but we had no choice here because some of our key players are suspended or injured
2133105 i had asked the club not to release them for the olympics and i would have preferred they never went to china in the first place because partizans interests come first for me
2133106 we continue to make progress on increasing our reserves and production as well as containing and reducing costs in this challenging environment of higher energy costs
2133107 if theres any inaccuracies in the story that multiplies it the seriousness by 10
2133108 became more extreme when we found out about the deceit
2133109 how could those players break the trust which is a fundamental of any sporting organisation
2133110 strikes at the principles and integrity that the collingwood football club is built on
2133111 its thanks to ideology that it fell to the 20th century to experience villainy on a scale of millions
2133112 i am inclined to think that the reason is that they give expression to a deep felt dissatisfaction with a world which does not and cannot live up to our moral ideals and to our dreams of perfection
2133113 t he revolt against civilisation may be a reaction against the strain of our civilisation and its demand for personal responsibility
2133114 there is a need more pressing by the day to question the value of the economic political and personal liberty that has been won
2133115 i felt strongly it would only be a burden to the world
2133116 the population of the world must be very quickly reduced
2133117 every time someone dies as a result of floods in bangladesh an airline executive should be dragged out of his office and drowned
2133118 humans would have no choice but to establish an earth commission for thermostatic control
2133119 inevitably one day some commissioner will suggest that their work would be more effectively done were they to concentrate on the root cause of the issue the total number of people on the planet
2133120 and with such a move the earth commission for thermostatic control will have transformed itself into an orwellian style world government with its own currency army and control over every person and every inch of our planet
2133121 as horrific as such an outcome is if we delay action to combat the climate crisis the carbon dictatorship may become essential for our survival
2133122 if indiana jones wasnt in it youd have to call it mutt williams and the search for elvis

2133128 you have to have something sacred to you and the people around you i shared so much of my life i should have something to hold on to
2133129 what obama represents is we as a people are part of the american dream
2133130 we were left out of the dream at a certain point now the dream is you can be anything and its not cliche

2133145 if youre going to put dirt in it who cares about stagnant water right now
2133146 but until we have the proper information im not moving forward
2133147 i couldnt believe it i went to follow and there it was sitting up on bricks
2133148 its just an ordinary holden wagon a few years old nothing special so i hope they got their kicks using my wheels for their street drags or whatever and leaving me stranded
2133149 its disgraceful in a hospital car park i couldnt believe it
2133150 hayley is a midwife and nurse at sunshine and you just cant believe people would do this in a hospital car park
2133151 we had other programming commitments and respect for other audiences so we cant keep all the people happy all the time

2133153 it is dangerous and highly toxic because the message to teenage girls is that their own prospects of success are based on body image and how to market themselves sexually
2133154 a vast number of football fans were not able to see it live
2133155 showing the game live was something we certainly discussed with the australian olympic committee and channel 7
2133156 there would have been an enormous number of football followers across the country who would have wanted to watch the game live

2133173 during the middle of a campaign you are always worried about taking time off
2133174 but you know i have been going pretty much straight for 18 months now
2133175 it has been about 19 months since i saw my grandmother
2133176 and she is at an age where its really important for me to see her and those little girls need a little love as does michelle so we are going to take the time all right
2133177 i am just surprised how much help you can get when you actually look around
2133178 one of my favourite bargains was the rings we bought them from a jewellers on the seafront in ilfracombe it was 19 for the two of them
2133179 now all we have got to do is wait for things to arrive from ebay and buy christophers mum dawn a dress
2133180 the piperjet exhibited excellent control response around all three axes
2133181 the ergonomics and the basic operation of the side stick control were excellent with well balanced and harmonized control inputs required for the air speeds that we tested moreover the expected level of pitch trim change with power applications was minimal and easy to overcome
2133182 i am interested in finding out how genuine they are that is the main problem i am not surprised at the size of the bid i always intended to get over 3 million
2133183 i have decided as a result of having this rather advanced prostate
2133184 therefore i will sell everything up down here and move back to london
2133185 john edwards repeatedly lied during his presidential campaign about an extra marital affair with a novice film maker the former senator admitted to abc news today in an interview for broadcast tonight on nightline edwards told abc news correspondent bob woodruff he did have an affair with 42 year old rielle hunter but said that he did not love her edwards also denied he was the father of hunters baby girl frances quinn although the one time democratic presidential candidate said he has not taken a paternity test
2133186 given the advantages of hindsight and the recent revelations how would you vote on that issue today and why
2133187 what do you think that saddam hussein would be doing with oil at 120 125 130 a barrel what do you think hed be doing
2133188 ill tell you what hed be doing hed be doing what he said he was committed to doing and thats acquiring and using weapons of mass destruction which he had done twice before
2133189 so let me just say right now we are free to disagree on that issue but the oil for food scandal which was a 12 billion scandal at the united nations was going on our planes were being shot at every day the cease fire was breaking down this was one of the most brutal regimes in history and theres no doubt in my mind in fact he told his interrogators he had the same commitment to acquiring and using weapons of mass destruction
2133190 a stable democracy an alley of the united states of america in the region a democratically elected a flawed but democratically elected government
2133191 if he were still in power i believe that the world would be far worse off especially with all the money hed be making off of oil and he would have his commitment to acquiring and using weapons of mass destruction thats my answer
2133192 this is particularly true for women who are most affected by the epidemic as for far too long hiv positive women have been invited only after agendas have been set out or policy decisions taken
2133193 it is necessary to fulfil the commitments made to ensuring womens and girls voices concerns and perspectives are incorporated in the decision making processes that affect their lives

2133195 hiv positive women and other key populations need to be more than bystanders or advisors in the formation of the content and direction of the aids response they must be supported to be leaders
2133196 then i saw what seemed to be a stabbing motion rather than a punching motion four or five times in very rapid succession
2133197 martin probably did not know when he began running away that he was running for his life pursued for such a distance by these defendants on cycles and mopeds
2133198 this is such a case which leads from dirty looks to death in one hour
2133199 the public have every right to be concerned about the increase growth of this sort of violence
2133200 the consequences of euro atlantic stability and security are grave
2133201 put diplomatic pressure on russia to reverse this perilous course
2133202 we should immediately call a meeting of the north atlantic council to assess georgias security and review measures nato can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation
2133203 the international community needs to establish a truly independent and neutral peace keeping force in south ossetia
2133204 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia and the united states the united nations security council and the international community should fully support a peaceful resolution to this crisis
2133205 this new wind farm demonstrates our commitment to dramatically increase the amount of energy we generate from renewable sources helping to cut the uks carbon emissions and secure our energy supplies
2133206 sheringham shoal will be the uks fourth largest wind farm approved to date and will help provide a significant contribution towards our energy targets
2133207 through the planning bill we are also looking to speed up the planning process for developers and improve consultations to make sure wind farms are built in the right places
2133208 we are in a desperate race against time in pursuit of prevention that works
2133209 if i had been able to say not only will arvs keep people alive but they can significantly reduce new infections this would have been a huge inducement
2133210 weve known for some time that the expansion of coverage of highly active arv therapy could help to reduce the number of new infections we were amazed at the actual number of new infections that can be potentially averted by expanding access to treatment

2133215 sen specter remains the most respected statewide public official in pennsylvania
2133216 but his age 78 and health problems could make him vulnerable to a challenge from hardballs chris matthews
2133217 theoretical match up there is a large undecided vote and many voters dont know enough about matthews to have an opinion
2133218 his contract at msnbc is up in 2009 and chris spent an extraordinary amount of time in pennsylvania before the democratic presidential primary in april
2133219 i think hes testing the political waters when asked by various reporters he hasnt ruled out running he hasnt taken it off the table
2133220 would chris be the strongest democrat on the board right now probably because of his celebrity and knowledge of politics
2133221 but he has a lifestyle decision to make first and foremost
2133222 certainly presents a very interesting scenario given his appeal and his knowledge of washington
2133223 the agency recognizes that a number of factors have contributed to high corn food and fuel prices as a nation
2133224 is strengthening our nations energy security and supporting americans farming communities
2133225 greatly disappointed with the epas inability to look past the good intentions of this policy to see the significant harm it is doing to farmers ranchers and american households for the epa to assert that this federal mandate is not affecting food prices not only goes against common sense but every americans grocery bill
2133226 america should be focusing on viable clean energy solutions like conservation solar and wind
2133227 instead the misguided corn ethanol mandate is forcing farmers to plow up marginal land and wildlife habitat while increasing global warming and dumping toxic fertilizers and pesticides into our precious water sources
2133228 so that is going to be a key element for the future
2133229 would have sabotaged the development and growth of new technologies and a cellulosic biofuels industry
2133230 cries out for a thorough updating and redesign leading to a new edition as most of its content is not only still true but very valuable until then despite its very real qualities i can only recommend it with strong reservations
2133231 i have to admit i liked the version 1 better because it was less funky this version still retains the meat and potatoes of the first version principles of how to write a documentation blueprint how to organize information how to index it etc its worth reading and reading again
2133232 may contain some good information not a lot but youll never find anything by looking in the index which is a truly good example of a really bad index

2133237 it will cost 38 percent more to build operate and decommission the nations first nuclear waste repository at yucca mountain nevada than the federal government estimated seven years ago
2133238 an increase in the amount of waste to be shipped and stored at the repository and more than 16 billion for inflation have added to the cost
2133239 yucca mountain is dead and it is time to move forward in a new direction with on site waste storage
2133240 yet there will be absolutely no public process to review these routes not by the nrc nuclear regulatory commission not by the doe and not even by the u s department of transportation this is a massive and dangerous shipping campaign but the nrc refuses to scrutinize it when considering does application to build the dump
2133241 doe does not even have complete plans to transport nuclear waste or to build the dump at yucca mountain which is in an earthquake prone environment
2133242 even worse the environmental protection agency has not decided what levels of radiation can be
2133243 there are too many problems with this project to list whether its the potential for groundwater contamination the feds inability to safely transport high level nuclear waste or the federal governments profound encroachment on states rights we must continue the fight against this ill conceived project
2133244 epa has committed outright scientific fraud in constructing its drinking water compliance boundary around the yucca mountain site the agencys proposal will permit a radioactive septic field in a region that relies solely on groundwater for drinking water and irrigation

2133248 the strategic acquisition when combined with skylines existing port mcnicoll project on nearby georgian bay will result in the creation of the largest full service year round master planned recreational destination in canada

2133254 theres no noise no checking the oil or how much gas youve got you just get on and go
2133255 i am pleased to report solid operating results for the quarter despite the difficult industry environment created by unrelentingly high fuel prices
2133256 the more resilient domestic canada market drove sustained revenue growth in the quarter and we achieved yield and unit growth through the successful introduction of a number of fare increases and fuel surcharges
2133257 as the cost of travel for consumers is brought in line with the price of fuel we anticipate a softening in demand
2133258 we will continue to manage the challenge through new revenue generation initiatives sound capacity management and continued focus on cost reduction
2133259 in some ways it has made things more difficult because the expectations became so high
2133260 then we won the european super cup and fa cup the following season and so suddenly everyone was saying ok the next step will be the
2133261 but then when you dont win it people say oh you cant go to that next step when maybe we were operating at the next level up but because the other teams around us were progressing as well it didnt seem that way
2133262 in some respects we were maybe our own worst enemies but of course id prefer to have that problem to be talking as a
2133263 the key is not to say that we can win the title because its clear that its the most difficult league in the world to win

2133266 the biggest driving factor now to the downside is the fact that the u s economy has a lot of company right now in terms of weakening economic growth
2133267 while that is significant the strength this event supposedly created yesterday was rather insignificant
2133268 you can always get a house from a business but you can never get a business from a house
2133269 is predestined for the role since training resumed at the end of june i have been able to assess the excellent way in which he leads the team to the point that he enjoys considerable respect from all the players from the youngsters to the older ones
2133270 i could no longer give the coach a guarantee i would still be playing football after my one year contract with vfb stuttgart expires
2133271 i therefore suggested to him and to goalkeeping coach andreas koepke they no longer include me in their plans
2133272 our success at the 2006 world cup will always be closely associated with lehmann but he also made an equally big contribution to our success at euro 2008
2133273 he has done much for german soccer and was always an important discussion partner for me
2133274 i was not able to guarantee to the national coach that i would still be playing football at the end of the coming season during which i am under contract to stuttgart
2133275 in these conditions i proposed to him and to andreas kopke that they should no longer include me in the national squad it has been a good period for me in the german team
2133276 he brought a great deal to german football above all it was his leadership quality which impressed me i dont know many players able to bring such experience into a team
2133277 hes come out from behind a parked car which would have obscured the view of the driver of the car and his view of the car coming
2133278 its one of those unfortunate things where its like a child runs out from behind a car and you cant stop in time
2133279 its an unfortunate accident where the driver is not really at fault
2133280 weve had repeated calls from residents that they need help crossing the road
2133281 its sad that it has to take a death to wake people up
2133282 this gene has been associated with a combination of kidney and eye disease in human patients
2133283 here we found a mutation which affects only the eyes suggesting this gene might be a candidate for human patients with eye disease only
2133284 it is a wide spectrum of conditions not just one
2133285 the problem is that there is a wide range of underlying defects and we havent got a magic bullet which can target these all at once
2133286 this research is really exciting as it helps our understanding of the genetic basis of cone rod dystrophies in humans
2133287 following significant further research this technique could facilitate the development of new treatments in the future
2133288 we see this as a really good sign and we hope something comes of it because were drowning in corruption out here
2133289 all the councillors care about is this big factional war out here but the ratepayers are stuck in the middle suffering from it

2133297 treat nature in terms of the cylinder the sphere the cone all in perspective
2133298 everything an indian does is in a circle and that is because the power of the world always works in circles and everything tries to be round
2133299 among the many and varied forms we see in the world around us the circle stands out as being unique due to its simplicity and completeness the circle has often been described as the most pure or perfect form
2133300 any line or form that directs the eye to a circles center will create a visually harmonious relationship with the circle
2133301 lines and edges which form a 90 degree relationship to a circles circumference are more stable looking than compositions that lack this relationship
2133302 the sphere is somehow a satisfying mass globes rubber balls and the earth itself all are spheres most people when they pick up a lump of clay or dough automatically form it into a sphere a sphere nearly always implies movement and time
2133303 when people sit down to talk together they try to arrange themselves roughly in a circle perhaps one reason for the circle as opposed to other forms is the fact that people like to sit at an angle to one another not side by side
2133304 make your curves strong a thin wiggle looks simply like a crooked straight line look at natural plant forms you will see that they are generally strong and bold
2133305 curves can be geometrical or flowing i think that curves should still employ a geometry in their conception rather than be free shaped wiggles
2133306 from numerous methodological flaws that were illuminated by the governments presentation and in many instances are obvious to anyone having basic familiarity with the case
2133307 we thought it was an issue that there were people giving to the campaign who had no intention of supporting or voting for john mccain
2133308 so we thought it was an appropriate measure at this point
2133309 reminding them of the campaign finance law and providing some information as to how to get a refund if thats what they desire
2133310 if it is not illegal for a foreign national to bundle checks it ought to be since its illegal for a foreign national to make contributions in the first place
2133311 the system is supposed to catch and report that sort of information
2133312 i had never heard of any of this before his previous supervisor had never heard of any of this before his current supervisor had never heard of any of this before
2133313 it surely seems as though ivins was a troubled man and something should have picked this up earlier he should have been rescreened and reevaluated in terms of his ability to have the access that he had
2133314 will likely require aggressive drug regimens and rely on the timing of initiating therapy
2133315 studies need to be done in the next few years to determine if very aggressive therapy early on will allow us to get a functional cure
2133316 we have to make sure the drug development remains in step with the evolution of the virus and that industry continues to invest
2133317 worrying signs that that isnt the case and that is something we have to put on the table
2133318 no company will try to sell soap if they havent done research for the community they are trying to sell to
2133319 it would pay off if we could bring that experience from the business world to our amateur approaches
2133320 children orphaned by aids are sadly only the tip of the iceberg of hiv affected children
2133321 it is the needs of all children especially vulnerable children not whether they meet the definition of orphan that must be our primary focus
2133322 the focus on orphans had individualized the challenge of care and support it has framed the epidemics impact on children as individuals rather than a national social problem and has separated assistance to children from efforts to support families and communities
2133323 2010 is 18 months from now what weve seen is that in a number of countries theyve already reached their universal access targets others not
2133324 when we look at global targets none of us believes that it will be 100 everywhere
2133325 but if you look at individual countries and if you look at the percent that have achieved universal coverage or will be close to universal coverage there may be much more than you think of
2133326 h omophobia biology and misplaced confidence that aids has become a treatable chronic illness are contributing to a disturbing flashback among scientists and activists
2133327 appear to be repeating the early patterns of the epidemic
2133328 an enormous grassroots movement sparked government action and more significantly effective prevention campaigns
2133329 we have come full circle in the beginning gay men in places like san francisco and new york proved we could do prevention when we moved from that and started talking about the broad scope of the epidemic suddenly men who have sex with men became marginalized
2133330 prevention fatigue confidence in new antiretroviral drugs the use of methamphetamines and the arrival of a generation of young men who did not experience the ravages of the 1980s
2133331 the same kinds of stigma and discrimination and institutionalized homophobia that failed gay men in america is now failing msm in the rest of the world
2133332 its difficult to provide services to men who have sex with men in countries where they dont acknowledge they exist
2133333 failed to bring down the incidence of hiv aids in msm because we have not tried
2133334 because machismo is pronounced in mexico and homosexuality is far from accepted social conditions in the country and in other parts of latin america force much sexual behavior into the shadows that increases the challenges that aids experts say they face in combating the risky sexual practices that fuel the disease
2133335 im not asking for special access for those who are coinfected with hiv and hepatitis just fairness in access
2133336 its true that organs for transplant are in short supply but nonetheless those with hiv hepatitis b or c can be equally good candidates
2133337 however here we are in mexico city still in the middle of a raging pandemic
2133338 to be sure there are multiple and daunting challenges ahead in terms of how we confront hiv globally not all but certainly some of these challenges can only be addressed through biomedical research
2133339 even with the drugs we have today or with forms of the drugs that are very similar to what we have today if we could develop forms of these drugs that could be taken for life with acceptable levels of toxicity than its in principle possible to offer everyone who is currently living with hiv infection the chance for a normal life this is the long term challenge that all of us face
2133340 prevention care and treatment for children continue to lag behind adults
2133341 support for affected children has been left largely to families extended kin and communities although they are the most appropriate group to care for children they cannot protect and care for children without assistance
2133342 when there is a country that discriminates that is conservative that criminalizes sex work the prevalence of hiv is higher
2133343 if the policy is bad today what will it mean for the next 20 years 50 years so that we start building campaigns building towards 2031 because by 2031 if we havent done anything it might be too late
2133344 from the ground up building comprehensive hiv aids care programs in resource limited settings

2133354 not only is moveon orgs anti drilling position out of step with 70 percent of americans but a member like mike conaway who represents the texas oil patch will probably see his approval rating surge upward as a result of these ads

2133436 in new jersey on memorial day it might be 90 degrees but the water is 50
2133437 so there were two type of people who would go to the beach that weekend one group would go up there stick a toe in the water and say i just dont know if i can do that then you would have those looney tunes that would throw their stuff down go running into the water and dive right in
2133438 basically the whole thought methodology is that were looking for players that want to dive right in were not looking for toe in the water players im not looking for people who see how things go im looking for people that want to make things go
2133439 well find out i know well have at least 22
2133440 were going to be able to physically compete inside our wide receivers defensive backs and linebackers can run and our running backs and tight ends arent too shabby
2133441 the packers are moving forward the jets are moving forward brett favre is moving forward and were moving forward
2133442 well its running a little bit behind which is not the end of the world but it does pose some challenges for us
2133443 well be sharing some classrooms normally an art teacher has her own art room but for the first couple of weeks the art teacher will actually be going to the classrooms where the kids are
2133444 weve got every available space full that we possibly can
2133445 i think once they move theyre going to be very excited because the building is such a beautiful learning facility
2133446 and i think it will be no more of a problem than it would be going there the first day because its a new building and theyll be having to learn their way around anyway
2133447 parents are glad theyre going to be at westside where theyre already familiar and they have the equipment there like the playground and library
2133448 i think for the most part everybody understands and is satisfied with the plan
2133449 the electrical and mechanical work is really close to being done
2133450 its mainly the floors and kitchen and gym area that need work a lot of the classrooms are already complete its really coming along and its going to be wonderful
2133451 its an outstanding facility and very well designed i think
2133452 its constructed very well its very student centered its very environmentally pleasing and it is just a great building were going to enjoy for many years to come its not just beautiful its practical

2133455 our class is about being able to communicate to an audience and to make sure we as writers are understood by the readers
2133456 its hard to explain sometimes but weve seen a pattern this entire summer that stocks fall or rise more toward the end of the day
2133457 its one of those phenomena in the market that momentum continues to carry us in a direction thats usually too far
2133458 a simpler ownership structure will open new opportunities for stronger top line growth by attracting new customers as well as retaining current customers with a broad and integrated product offering
2133459 it will also facilitate more effective deployment of capital across the enterprise putting more assets to work where they can deliver the best value for customers
2133460 our clients have been caught in an unprecedented liquidity crisis
2133461 we are solving it by giving them the option of selling their positions to us

2133468 very difficult operating environments in 2008 which are expected to lead to significantly reduced results in those businesses compared with 2007
2133469 as a result naccos third quarter is currently expected to be very weak with results currently expected to improve in the fourth quarter
2133470 all the people i chat with at the grocery store the gas station shopping for school clothes all are feeling very depressed because of the beating their budgets are taking
2133471 the only thing that is staying the same is my salary
2133472 gas food utilities are at an all time high with no dramatic increase in our pay scale
2133473 we limit our dining out to one night per week and grocery shopping has been limited to needed items
2133474 she has never been in any trouble besides this that doesnt mean she didnt do what was alleged
2133475 but she didnt get a fair trial and everyone has a right to a fair trial
2133476 we talked to the firehouse home inspections and also visited with serve pro who are the clean up specialists out of wichita
2133477 that was removed we disinfected the tunnel and took samples after the fact and everything is clear

2133486 we require one parking spot per room so 130 rooms 130 spaces
2133487 were going to park underneath the building which kills two birds at one time the site is contaminated a great deal of contamination underground
2133488 once a development has been approved we would like to see it finished we dont need another hole in the ground
2133489 if were going to bring in a big chain this may be an excellent opportunity for them to showcase that it can do something unique and interesting
2133490 we have a subpoena come talk to the grand jury
2133491 to prevent such protests inside their own borders chinese authorities recently threatened to take away one female activists two babies as she tried to enter the country
2133492 people like it a lot we do get comments we get complaints too i have to be honest about that
2133493 you have got to look at the other side of the issue
2133494 we must bid farewell to autocracy whatever shape it takes whatever justification it gives authoritarian government always ends up trampling on equality denying justice and stealing happiness and laughter from the people
2133495 we should also leave behind discrimination because it is narrow minded and ignorant denies contact and warmth and corrodes mankinds belief that we can better ourselves
2133496 the only way to avoid misunderstanding war and bloodshed is to defend freedom of expression and to communicate with sincerity concern and good intentions
2133497 to rediscover our future we should say goodbye to our past
2133498 it symbolises a turning point in chinas relationship with the outside world
2133499 almost 60 years after the founding of the peoples republic we still live under autocratic rule without universal suffrage we do not have an open media even though freedom of expression is more valuable than life itself
2133500 today is not the time to dwell on our problems but neither should we accept those who tell us these games are not political we live in a world where everything is politicised
2133501 well its official its cool to make fun of gay people again how do we know because the folks in medialand told us as much by relentlessly cheerleading two gay unfriendly songs by newcomer katy perry
2133502 i hope you hang yourself with your h amp m scarf while jacking off listening to mozart
2133503 i dont think shes being homophobic i think she might be a bit dumb a bit un self aware the kind of behaviour you get from some privileged people oh i didnt realise perhaps she doesnt know any gay people who have suffered verbal or physical abuse
2133504 theyre not seriously homophobic but they can be read as implicitly demeaning gay people i am sure katy would get a critical reception if she expressed comparable sentiments in a song called ur so black jewish or disabled should there be different standards for lyrics about gay issues as opposed to race and disability issues i dont think so having said this the homophobia of some reggae rap and ragga music is far worse some of these songs explicitly incite the murder of lesbians and gays they are much more offensive than any lyrics sung by katy perry
2133505 the lyrics are slightly demeaning to gay people but it validates the reality of a lot of gay peoples lives
2133506 sometimes that degree of honesty is no bad thing and thats not for one moment to be taken as saying its acceptable for some of the more extreme rappers to justify themselves
2133507 richard serra has changed the nature of sculpture in our time he has not had an exhibition in london since 1992 we are very pleased to bring his new work to the gallerys spaces which were built with his work in mind
2133508 at first i couldnt grasp that i am on the course this september its only a month away im ecstatic this shows people that determination and perseverance do pay off and if you think you have been mistreated by a university you should fight your cause
2133509 now i see my future going somewhere i just cant wait to be at medical school
2133510 universities should be open to people like ahmed who has done everything that society would ask of him
2133511 medical practitioners hold a position of responsibility in society and must often deal with vulnerable people the public must have confidence in the integrity and probity of its doctors
2133512 the latest figures show private equity is feeling the credit crunch much more comprehensively and has hit a four year low overall
2133513 there is no market for buying and we cant sell for a good price so we are focused on managing our portfolio of companies
2133514 the types of deals that have made it past the finishing line in the last few months have tended to be defensive plays deals such as biffa at 1 2bn in the waste sector and abbot at 0 9bn an energy business are good examples of the type of deals getting done by contrast the total value of retail deals has fallen dramatically
2133515 much of the time you spend on these deals is working out an agreement on how the business will be managed and where you want it to go it may be that three firms partner to take a listed company private but one firm will take the lead and drive through the agreed agenda
2133516 why buy now when the price will be much cheaper next year
2133517 if youve been around a long time you know that in periods like this funds are invested more slowly and reap greater returns

2133522 much of our spending power is being transferred to commodity producing countries from that point on its their spending power not ours weve lost it so we shouldnt try to come up with tricks to carry on behaving the same way as we did in the past no well have to accept it bite the bullet and make sure things dont get out of hand
2133523 i think in the first place they will avoid consumer durables things like new cars sofas or curtains people will make do with them for longer only at a later stage will they economise on the grocery budget

2133536 air conditioning to be maintained at 70 degrees fahrenheit with relative indoor humidity not to exceed 50
2133537 beginning four days prior to the debate until the day after the debate
2133538 truly spiritual people find the expression of abundance by others in poor taste and evidence of those individuals lack of true spiritual integrity
2133539 a healthy body an inquiring mind a fearless heart a creative spirit that can access from the divine source and a well developed sense of humor
2133540 well you could get a new phone like mine and you could use that as an organizer
2133541 chick your phone and your pda can be as one come on over to this side
2133542 to avoid turning the slowdown into a slump as soon as conditions allow the banks next rate move should be down
2133543 the longer inflation fears force the mpc to leave interest rates on hold at 5 the more severe the looming recession will be interest rates will eventually have to fall very far to lift the uk economy out of its current malaise
2133544 once interest rates start to fall i think that they will be cut rapidly perhaps all the way to 3 5 by next summer and perhaps even lower subsequently however this will come too late to prevent an outright recession later this year and a long period of very weak economic activity thereafter
2133545 pressure on householders income together with a very significant reduction in mortgage finance due to the global financial crisis is constraining potential house buyers ability to enter the market this is resulting in both lower prices and activity levels
2133546 it would be wrong to suggest that the market conditions over the foreseeable future will be anything other than tough
2133547 all my life ive been here and at the end of it i have nothing and have nowhere else to go
2133548 they live in extreme poverty and are subjected to punishments including lashings
2133549 these groups do not want equality they do not respect the identity and diversity of our people
2133550 evo as you never abandoned the people the people will never abandon you vote yes
2133551 this referendum is going to clearly show the support for president evo morales
2133552 the ratification of his mandate will set on stone the fact that bolivia is on the right track that it is undergoing a transformation
2133553 if the president is not revoked on sunday he should respect our will of autonomy and we will then try to respect his authority
2133554 we cannot back this so called process of change as this is not a change for all bolivians
2133555 we have to back this government because it is defending the rights of the indigenous peoples but it has been acting very slowly
2133556 nearly half of the uks carbon emissions come from heating buildings and industrial processes we need to urgently accelerate the adoption of biomass heating systems if we are to meet the governments 2020 renewables targets
2133557 we know the technology is mature and widely used in europe but the challenge in the uk is to reduce costs establish robust supply chains and drive widespread market uptake
2133558 a number of treatments have crept into fertility clinics over the years and are now part of our usual repertoire but as with many things in infertility most of these have not been properly evaluated
2133559 almost all couples with unexplained infertility will have one or both of these treatments but neither of them is significantly more effective than telling the couple to just go home and get on with it which is a lot cheaper and more fun
2133560 these treatments are offered by virtually every district hospital up and down the country so the total costs are tremendous particularly at a time when potentially more effective treatments such as ivf arent being funded because of lack of money in the system
2133561 this has to change clinical guidelines because none of these interventions are free
2133562 as a direct result of the lack of evidence many couples with unexplained infertility endure and even request expensive potentially hazardous and often unnecessary treatments
2133563 intrauterine insemination has been offered to couples with unexplained infertility for many years but if there is no benefit in doing so then we should re evaluate the clinical guidelines so that nhs money is used wisely
2133564 send out the wrong signals at a time when the uk needs more investment in generation
2133565 the idea of it being completely absent from the most important exams of your childhood is disgraceful
2133566 i used to write for small orchestras when i was 15
2133567 if you dont learn to read music then theres a whole tradition that becomes very exclusive and shouldnt be
2133568 it depends what you believe a secondary school musical education is for
2133569 if its about accessing the western classical tradition then of course you need to learn staff notation
2133570 just because a musical tradition is transmitted through staff notation does not mean that it is superior you only have to spend half an hour with good indian musicians to appreciate that
2133571 where i think damon albarn is right is that if you think you are ever going to need to use staff notation you need to learn it young like every other kind of musical skill
2133572 i am not a musician i dont go in too deep if you have the music in your head and you sing it with your body then youll be all right
2133573 i dont read music i dont write i dont play all i can do is tell you how it goes like dumdum dum dumde dum
2133574 of course we hope that these will be a great games even the greatest
2133575 if we dont tackle doping part of the world will leave us because the public will desert any sport any time if they are not satisfied it has integrity
2133576 the excitement i feel and the ioc feels is that of an athlete before a major competition
2133577 as for the significance of these games each games is important for the olympic movement and each has its own identity
2133578 i think this will mean a lot for the perception of china on the one hand for the rest of the world to discover china will be to discover a country that is for most of the world a bit mysterious but they will find a country with 5 000 years of history a fascinating country i believe the spotlight on china will help the world to understand china and it will also help china to understand the world
2133579 even if they dare to commit any crime during the olympics they wont be able to escape easily
2133580 give us 16 days of olympics and be rewarded with 5 000 years of our civilisation
2133581 it is all the foreign devils better to have a safe games than a farce like the torch relays in london paris and san francisco it was such a loss of face we dont want it here on our soil
2133582 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech that he gave in 2002
2133583 hillary clinton was making a strong and valid argument for why john mccain will be the next president
2133584 in this case we couldnt have said it better ourselves
2133585 we are 18 million voices dedicated to seeing senator clinton reach the next milestone the white house
2133586 at the democratic convention we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party will be fully unified heading into the november election
2133587 i mean everybody comes and they want to yell and scream and have their opportunity and i think thats all to the good because then you know everybody can go ok great
2133588 the best way i think to do that is to have a strategy so that my delegates feel like theyve had a role and that their legitimacy has been validated and that kind of you know there is a catharsis
2133589 the important thing to keep in mind is that the google website optimizer is a tool
2133590 you never know when you may need this person to get you something
2133591 we want to see whether the provisions of the agreement are serious we will be satisfied if the agreement contains the withdrawal of us forces
2133592 if so we will complete the reorganisation of the mahdi army which aims to transform it into a social organisation
2133593 we will be forced to await the decision of withdrawal of american forces
2133594 there has been an agreement ubs will pay 19 4 billion dollars to buy back these securities
2133595 todays solution provides further relief beginning in september to investors who have been understandably frustrated by the industry wide failure of the ars market
2133596 our clients have been caught in an unprecedented liquidity crisis
2133597 were thrilled to welcome these two beautiful animals to our family at the baghdad zoo
2133598 the conservartors centre is proud to contribute these tigers toward the restoration of the baghdad zoo and the important education work it will engage in over the next decade
2133599 after 13 days of the us occupation we found the animals in miserable conditions
2133600 only a few of the bigger animals were still alive such as four lions and three bears
2133601 we have forgotten this matter as it is in the past and the us apologised
2133602 we did not use to come here much but after we heard that there are new animals we wanted to look around especially for our kids
2133603 we really like the tigers and we hope they will bring more
2133604 we want to be able to see the animals alive like other children around the world we want to be happy like other children

2133625 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits
2133626 fuel prices have doubled in the past year a successful hedging programme mitigated the impact but nevertheless fuel costs at 706 million were up 233 million in the quarter we expect our fuel bill to top 3 billion this year the equivalent of more than 8 million every day
2133627 the airline sector is in trouble losses this year could reach us 6 1 billion more than wiping out the us 5 6 billion that airlines made in 2007 falling demand and rising costs are re shaping the industry
2133628 to survive the crisis urgent action is needed airports and air navigation service providers must come to the table with efficiencies that deliver cost savings labour must understand that efficiency is the only path to job security and governments must stop crazy taxation and give airlines the freedom to merge and consolidate where it makes business sense
2133629 i know that there have been a lot of questions on this subject senator barack obama and i share the goal of ensuring that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected
2133630 i want to assure everyone we are working together with senator obamas campaign and the dnc and i am confident we will have a successful and unified convention in denver
2133631 truly supporting senator obama and encouraging your supporters to do the same or are you just saying what you have to
2133632 there hasnt been controversy other than what you guys are projecting right now
2133633 i didnt say that i said they are working it out guys
2133634 every democratic convention has had a least two people on the roll call does the dnc want this to be a nomination or a coronation of course hillary should be honored for her fight in this race to not do so would be against the history of politics fair is fair she played to win and deserves her name at the roll call vote this is democracy in action not totalitarianism
2133635 pariss message dont stress dont dis each others ideas lets just try everything it doesnt get any smarter than that
2133636 by contrast are engaged in a phony war that refuses to accept the hiltonian point we need every tactic in this new energy war we need all the production conservation and research strategies we can imagine nothing should be belittled or dismissed everything should be attempted we cant afford to think otherwise
2133637 im 67 years old theres no reason for me to lie to anyone i dropped off
2133638 what do i have that i did not receive if then i received it why do i boast as if i did not receive it

2133640 they should strive to have their hearings completed and the findings made public prior to july 1964 when the presidential campaigns will begin to get hot he stated it would be unfair to present the findings after july
2133641 ford indicated he would keep me thoroughly advised as to the activities of the commission
2133642 he stated this would have to be done on a confidential basis however he thought it should be done
2133643 i referred to this weeks issue of newsweek magazine which contains a rather clear analysis of the report
2133644 i told congressman ford that newsweek was owned by the washington post and that apparently some one was trying to curry favor i told him we of course did not get along very well with either the washington post or newsweek he said that he was in the same boat that he liked neither one of these publications
2133645 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
2133646 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
2133647 no decisions have been made and so we are trying to work all this through with the dnc and with the obama campaign
2133648 what we want to have happen is for senator obama to be nominated by a unified convention of democrats
2133649 we can talk about chris till the dogs come home i married chris i had a baby with chris chris will be in my life for the rest of my life
2133650 its so hard for me because im so open to hold back i could really just go on forever about this stuff
2133651 but everything else ive learned that things are better left private until youre actually planning the wedding
2133652 no matter what is going on in my life relationship wise chris takes absolute precedence its important for ryder to hear me say how wonderful chris is and how much chris misses him
2133653 am i gonna look back and say god i wish i could have gone to that concert id rather be listening to my son sing songs id rather be watching him sleep

2133659 i have knocked on the doors of many of the accused been harangued by locals horrified at jersey being lazily painted as a sinister island of secrets spoken to tourism officials and still i am not sure what the truth is
2133660 an outspoken critic of what he sees as the islands tendency to brush awkward problems under the carpet
2133661 it is tempting to use the islands tax haven status as a metaphor for the locals ability to keep even the shadowiest of secrets
2133662 jersey is a small isolated island which encourages a wariness of outsiders i was surprised to see how many powerful figures share the same name

2133665 the driver saw that the bridge was moving and was starting to fall
2133666 he immediately slammed on the emergency brakes and hid in the engine compartment of the locomotive
2133667 six seconds later there was the shock and it was still going at 120 kilometres an hour
2133668 i heard a terrible noise i immediately left my office to see what had happened the image before me will never leave me until the day i die
2133669 it is not easy to speak when you have a catastrophe of such proportions before your eyes
2133670 the czech government will examine this catastrophe on august 20
2133671 if there had been the slightest suspicion of complications for example cranial head trauma then they would certainly have been kept in
2133672 our carriage was full of young people and we were having fun then there was the crash chaos people were dying they had no legs and arms i am alive i have been born again
2133673 liebe chinesische freunde liebe athleten china hat lange davon getr umt seine t ren zu ffen und die athleten der welt nach peking einzuladen und heute abend ist dieser traum wahr geworden gratulation peking
2133674 this is a lot more than about china if we think this is only chinas moment its a big mistake its the moment of the world
2133675 the world has never needed mutual understanding mutual toleration and mutual cooperation as much as it does today
2133676 anyone who tries to disturb the olympics now by arousing social instability should be severely punished
2133677 i came to beijing last night to celebrate the olympics even though i dont have a ticket
2133678 china is never more glorious than friday the whole world is watching us
2133679 this is a lot more than about china if we think this is only chinas moment its a big mistake its the moment of the world
2133680 there was so much exciting news about the olympics that i decided six month ago to come here and see for myself
2133681 to me the website seems like it missing a major component and for some reason doesnt seem as functional its simply too plain for me
2133682 we both hope that not only the companys look will change but hope they will change the way they conduct their business

2133699 the employees are giving input on what plan they want
2133700 its great to get employee input but that has to be a management decision
2133701 we will have you guys look at the whole package
2133702 if you want to reduce down from there we can do that
2133703 every dollar we trim we ought to be plugging into road and bridge
2133704 can we afford to expand and increase service at this rate at this time
2133705 another option is to do a general tax and a portion of that will go to the cities
2133706 i feel were three months behind if we try to do it in november
2133707 if the cities dont support it i dont think it will pass
2133708 youre not going to get your three biggest towns to support you
2133709 i think we need to do this now because if we wait the next federal government will probably raise include tax
2133710 you can control how much sales tax you spend you cant control property tax
2133711 it was drama since the project first started and then blam attik took it over

2133717 communication is a symbolic process whereby reality is produced maintained repaired and transformed
2133718 we urge all parties georgians south ossetians and russians to de escalate the tension and avoid conflict
2133719 we are working on mediation efforts to secure a cease fire and we are urging the parties to restart their dialogue
2133720 we are asking our friends and the united states among them to somehow to try to mediate and try to persuade russia to stop this military aggression and invasion of georgia
2133721 what we heard is that the state department and the entire administration is deeply concerned and that they are heavily engaged with russia trying to de escalate the situation
2133722 what is most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
2133723 to establish a truly independent and neutral peacekeeping force in south ossetia
2133724 the u s is looking to streamline the command and control by making mckiernan essentially in charge of all u s forces in afghanistan so that one person can deploy them in support of the overall mission
2133725 we urge restraint on all sides that violence would be curtailed and that direct dialogue could ensue in order to help resolve their differences
2133726 she has never been in any trouble besides this that doesnt mean she didnt do what was alleged
2133727 but she didnt get a fair trial and everyone has a right to a fair trial
2133728 id like to see her come out of there in a hearse
2133729 thats the way she should come out there dead you know not that we hate her or anything i hold no animosity against her but she took my dads life
2133730 je speelt toch geen wow daar moet je voor betalen je bent gek als je dat doet
2133731 wow zorgt ervoor dat mensen niet meer een echt sociaal leven hebben
2133732 wow is niet leuk het ziet er oud uit en de graphics zijn stom
2133733 i know our program manager is ranking captains on landing with less fuel i dont care to be ranked i think this is a safety problem and i believe fuel is your friend
2133734 looking back i would have liked more gas yesterday and i was already carrying tanker fuel if i wouldnt have had this extra there would have been real problems
2133735 far below my comfort zone and probably less than the minimum fuel required by the fars federal aviation regulations
2133736 our fuel situation had not become critical yet but had we had any delay i would have had to declare a fuel emergency
2133737 i am not sure if the flight plan as given to me by my company was a real flight plan or if they were just telling me it was so that i would continue to jfk thus saving them time and expense in the future if such a situation presents itself again i will divert to my initial destination regardless of what my company says i can do the safety of my crew far outweighs any financial burden to the company
2133738 this was probably the new fuel saving initiative by the company management to save money
2133739 north south operation is very unpredictable along the east coast i dont think this is a place where we should skimp on fuel
2133740 relaying my opinion on the reduced fuel load and my suggestion not to compromise fuel loads in and out of florida
2133741 because in an attempt to abide by the new fuel conservation procedures just adopted by the company not enough fuel was put on the aircraft to handle a simple delay in an effort to save money an aircraft had to divert the aircraft arrived at its destination two hours late finally the pilots had to get off their trip early because of fatigue and because they would have flown nine hours and 40 minutes if they had continued on
2133742 ten minutes of hold fuel remained unchanged because management is pressuring dispatch to fly with limited hold fuel to reduce costs
2133743 ten minutes of hold fuel into an airport with marginal conditions because the dispatcher does not want his her name on the fuel list for the week printed and hung by management
2133744 what the deputies committee has raised is given the possibility that political fragmentation in pakistan is going to continue do we need to change our strategy
2133745 the argument that we may destabilize pakistan has taken us to where we are right now
2133746 pursuing the policy of public praise and private pressure on pakistan doesnt work
2133747 we need to enhance the capacity of hitting these targets
2133748 secretaries of the senate have presided occasionally throughout history when for one reason or another the presiding officer either wasnt there or the senate wasnt organized
2133749 if a senator is available a senator will preside there wasnt this time

2133752 events in pennsylvania have shown that the gaming control board despite its best efforts is not competent to handle the challenging task of examining license applicants backgrounds by itself said the groups coordinator dianne berlin
2133753 a relatively simple ruse persuaded dozens of prominent security analysts to connect on their social networking pages with people who werent friends at all they were fake profiles purportedly of other well known security pros
2133754 some social networking sites can be dangerous because they allow people to post programming code used for good or evil on other peoples pages
2133755 we find her endorsement had a positive effect on the votes obama received increased the overall voter participation rate and increased the number of contributions received by obama
2133756 are few academic studies documenting a clear link or lack thereof between endorsements and voter behavior
2133757 oprah is regarded as one of the most prominent and influential public figures in the united states if a celebrity endorsement is ever going to have an empirically identifiable influence then it is likely to be hers
2133758 upper bound of the potential effect of a celebrity endorsement
2133759 for example would we expect a similar increase for mike huckabee in areas where chuck norris was particularly popular
2133760 this does not mean that other endorsers would not have an effect but rather that such effects may be more difficult to detect
2133761 obama08 of 7 25 pm and others were not made by any legitimate obama supporter
2133762 in just one day this volcano set the kyoto protocol back 15 years obliterating the otherwise outstanding success of our multi billion dollar efforts to curb the release of cow farts into the atmosphere
2133763 therefore we demand that this eruption be considered unscientific and thus disqualified from inclusion into climate change models need i mention that it wasnt sanctioned by the the united nations
2133764 its fascinating to watch barack obama change his opinions on the u s troop surge in iraq heres a combo a los angeles times report on deletions of obamas previous anti surge position on his web site plus a youtube video showing his flip flops on the issue
2133765 like everything barack obama says that pledge was operative only as long as it was in obamas political interest
2133766 ok this is pathetic obama now says that his anti nafta rhetoric during the campaign was a bit overheated
2133767 if i am the democratic nominee i will aggressively pursue an agreement with the republican nominee to preserve a publicly financed general election
2133768 after a day spent paying lip service to both sides of the debate while studiously avoiding the issue of whether the actual statute at stake in heller was unconstitutional he finally bites the bullet no pun intended and addresses it
2133769 barack obama told the milwaukee journal sentinel in february that he was open to voucher programs but just last week announced his intentions to squash the dc pilot program
2133770 im curious as to whats motivating this new compromise is there any logic behind it or is it a simple something for both sides political solution
2133771 we do have to crack down on those employers that are taking advantage of the situation
2133772 in january 2004 obama said he supported eliminating criminal penalties for marijuana use in the oct 30 2007 presidential debate he joined other democratic candidates in opposing the decriminalization of marijuana
2133773 at a time when the surge appears to be working is that the right time to try and set time tables for withdrawing all american troops
2133774 and you pull out according to that time table regardless of the situation even if theres serious sectarian violence
2133775 ten years ago when obama was running for statewide office in an exclusive chicago district he opposed the death penalty he now supports the ultimate penalty
2133776 during the recent obama pander tour the presumptive democratic nominee unnecessarily endorsed president bushs faith based initiative a sort of patronage program that rewards religious activists for their political support with public grants
2133777 youll notice barack obama is now wearing a flag pin
2133778 i can no more disown jeremiah wright than i can disown my white grandmother then wiped away a tear and hailed him as the second coming of abraham lincoln
2133779 barack obama aligned himself with welfare reform on monday launching a television ad which touts the way the overhaul
2133780 contradicting what obama said at the debate the old footage shows the senator saying
2133781 i never said that we should try to go ahead and get single payer single payer healthcare is an euphemism for socialized medicine
2133782 many on the right of the political spectrum welcomed obamas remarks at aipac but the clarification of his position left several cold
2133783 barack obama has returned to the no preconditions policy for meeting with mahmoud ahmadinejad according to obama foreign policy adviser anthony lake financial times also discovered in its interview with lake that obama has reversed himself on iraq now saying that the withdrawal is off
2133784 although summer hasnt officially begun flip flop season is well underway and it appears senator obama has joined the club on tuesday obama whose support for coal to liquid has been widely criticized by environmentalists sent out a press release clarifying his position on liquid coal
2133785 following an attack iran could quickly rebuild its centrifuge program in small easily hidden facilities focused on making weapon grade uranium for nuclear weapons
2133786 without that knowledge an attack is unlikely to significantly delay irans mastery of enrichment with gas centrifuges
2133787 whats the evidence that he did anything other than know how to make anthrax and have all kinds of it at his disposal
2133788 there are a lot of armchair detectives and instant experts out there formulating opinions not based on a full set of the facts the only airtight cases in life are on csi in prime time
2133789 we are excited to bring olympia scott back to phoenix for the rest of the season to help us down the playoff stretch
2133790 her leadership was instrumental in our memorable run to the championship last season
2133791 i do want to come tomorrow but im really busy just now
2133792 but there is no peace and democracy in burma and its impossible to go home
2133793 american people care deeply about the people of burma and we pray for the day in which the people will be free
2133794 the noble cause has many devoted champions and i happen to be married to one of them
2133795 twenty years have gone by everything is still the same or maybe worse in burma
2133796 we know that burma is a very rich country rich in natural resources and the junta uses those resources to prop themselves up for their own benefit not for the benefit of the people of burma
2133797 in a reasonable way that will allow the judge to remain on the bench
2133798 he was clearly wrong and he has admitted that hes a very good judge with a good judicial record and he got no benefit whatsoever from this
2133799 was not filed docketed or otherwise made a part of any official record and was not issued in connection with any pending criminal matter
2133800 modelling suggests expanding anti retroviral therapy by 50 would lead to a 30 drop in new infections
2133801 weve known for some time that the expansion of coverage with highly active anti retroviral therapy could help reduce the number of new infections
2133802 however we were amazed at the actual number of new infections that can be potentially averted by expanding access to treatment
2133803 no one is talking about treating our way out of the epidemic but by treating people you reach two objectives you save lives and prevent further infections
2133804 what is dramatic about montaners hypothesis is the tremendous boost it will give to treatment especially in africa
2133805 i spent years begging african governments to treat people to save lives if i had been able to say not only are you going to be able to keep people alive but you will reduce infection over the long run there would have been a huge inducement to rollout treatment more widely
2133806 we will dump the price to wherever it needs to be in order to get to 80
2133807 if passengers are booking ahead of the 80 seat target we will close off the cheap seats if we are booking behind it we will open up more cheap fares
2133808 ultimately it is oil and the operating losses that will force some of these guys to the wall
2133809 airlines are dealing with high oil prices weakening demand and the need to maximise revenues in different ways
2133810 ba is increasing average fares but letting the number of seats sold per flight slip that does not work with ryanairs network or its product plus ryanair is trying to grow at 14 per year while ba is shrinking different growth profiles means different reactions on fares
2133811 if airlines get a break in the oil price some of them will get financing from some idiot the more expensive oil is the faster we roll up the loss making companies that are not going to survive anyway
2133812 for the past 30 years we have dismantled barriers opened doors and windows been dazzled by sunshine and felt the wind of profound change in the olympics we expect to witness new heights of effort and hope speed and strength that will inspire china to lift the pace of reform to be more determined more courageous and more at peace with ourselves
2133813 bt are talking about 40mb in 2012 we have got 50mb now and by 2012 we would have the technical capability of delivering up to 200 mb per second we are leading next generation access in this country

2133816 sold to investors as essentially cash equivalents they were represented as liquid and they turned out to be anything but
2133817 this is not just a wall street issue its a main street issue
2133818 i represent the people the people are saying they want their money back
2133819 our most important focus continues to be on helping our clients
2133820 this has no relationship to nor does it involve john edwards in any way andrew young is the father of my child
2133821 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi funds continue to pile up in the bank
2133822 our second quarter results reflect challenging conditions in the housing and mortgage markets that began in 2006 and have deepened through 2007 and 2008
2133823 to help us manage through the most difficult us housing market in more than 70 years
2133824 raise the specter that we are not out of the woods yet despite some better than expected earnings results although still down significantly from last year in the second quarter
2133825 the world was watching and i hope they loved it too
2133826 i strongly believe societies that allow the free expression of ideas tend to be the most prosperous and the most peaceful
2133827 the chinese government and people have seriously implemented the solemn commitments made to the international society since beijing won the olympic bid in 2001
2133828 egyptian police have arrested 587 illegal migrants most of them africans since the beginning of the year as they were trying to enter israel
2133829 its nice to go back and look at past data if i had a good race three years ago i can look back and analyze how i trained for it
2133830 deeply concerned by the decision by the israeli authorities to approve the construction
2133831 the construction of settlements anywhere in the occupied palestinian territories including east jerusalem is illegal under international law
2133832 this decision serves to undermine the credibility of the ongoing peace process
2133833 settlement activities prejudge the outcome of final status negotiations and compromise the viability of a concerted two state solution
2133834 to ensure a complete freeze on settlement activities including that for natural growth in east jerusalem as well and to dismantle the unauthorised outposts built since 2001
2133835 we are concerned about this visit because we think it is not the appropriate time to host the
2133836 once again this government has shown that its words and commitments are meaningless and they have no intention of keeping to their word
2133837 the continued construction in the west bank and in jerusalem is another death blow to the annapolis process
2133838 the board of directors which includes five new members who were elected at the june 13 shareholder meeting established the current dividend consistent with the previously stated objective of returning approximately 50 percent of the companys expected free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends
2133839 its not so much convincing people who have walked away from us
2133840 its engaging people who dont think of ford as a car brand
2133841 given where we were and where we needed to get to i felt someone from outside would break some molds
2133842 ford has to change a lot for a maverick approach like farleys to take hold
2133843 saving ford has to appeal to ones ego rather than playing it relatively safe at toyota
2133844 but helping toyota rack up another 12 billion in profits isnt much of a legacy
2133845 you can learn a great deal about leadership if you take it as seriously as other disciplines
2133846 leverage our existing tools to make a major impact in the nonprofit world
2133847 the academy helped me to realize that its o k not to have your hands in everything
2133848 we need to check on you before we can spare the time to talk with you
2133849 would you mind filling out our questionnaire as the next step in the process can i answer any questions for you to help you feel comfortable investing more time in our company

2133851 the last year at the rfu has been very enjoyable and ive learned a lot
2133852 ive gained a lot of experience from working alongside the senior squad and as part of the academy structure and it has all been invaluable to my development as a coach
2133853 im very honoured to be named really looking forward to exciting times hopefully well have a good season
2133854 i will maintain the standards off the pitch and the tempo in training and make sure were disciplined enough to give ourselves every chance to win something
2133855 this game will give us first hand experience of the law changes
2133856 its a great opportunity for us to get an early look at the implications
2133857 its been very encouraging weve got a lot of fitness strength and conditioning under our belt
2133858 we havent done a lot of rugby up till now but weve still got four or five weeks till the start of the season
2133859 elvis will enhance and add depth to our potent midfield he shares the same work and playing ethos as seilala mapusua
2133860 mine t rer ig r m v re et sundhedstegn
2133861 we cant dabble in the business policies or the personnel policies of an airline
2133862 what we found was that because they carried less fuel on the airplane they were getting into situations where they had to tell air traffic control i need to get on the ground
2133863 the additional cost of carrying unnecessary fuel adversely affects americans financial success
2133864 we didnt see any proposed changes we thought needed to be made
2133865 to either not stop for fuel when needed or to carry insufficient amounts of fuel
2133866 adding fuel indiscriminately reduces profit sharing and possibly pension funding
2133867 its a safety of flight issue and it needs to be treated as such
2133868 if dispatchers and pilots are saying the airlines are pressuring them and its having a chilling effect on the decisions they make every day in regard to the fuel loads and it looks its like eroding the authority of the pilot in command then that issue needs the attention of the government regulators who are there to oversee the system
2133869 few of us believe that the criminal justice system is a success jacoby argues that our system ought to work better if we adopt some puritanical punishments such as whipping or flogging
2133870 he seems like a man whose opinion is relatively normal and moral pointing out flaws such as the
2133871 jacoby also gives statistics as evidence to support the argument
2133872 jacobys argument begins to break down with his implications and assumptions
2133873 he never claims to know if these methods worked or not possibly because of lack of records but that is a mute point in his argument
2133874 the conclusion that jacoby was being sarcastic but wanted to bring up the idea of alternative punishments
2133875 there was not even a thread of doubt in my mind
2133876 if they thought we were involved in any way they would have never left us alone we would have wound up in gitmo or some place
2133877 since things quieted down hes put his life back together again and hes in a stable environment right now
2133878 as far as i know he just wants his name cleared as publicly as it was smeared
2133879 if they had just wanted to pin this on someone we were the ideal target and they didnt do that
2133880 well at least you werent crooked cause then you really might have been feeling bad
2133881 no i really dont have any ideas to tell what else was there to do
2133882 desperate to avoid the merits of clemenss claims mcnamee moves to dismiss on insubstantial and frivolous grounds that are contrary to controlling authority which requires mcnamee to answer to a texas court and jury for his intentional conduct that injured a texas resident in texas
2133883 because most of the key witnesses in this case are in the southern district of texas the cost of attendance in new york city for willing witnesses is substantially higher than it would be in houston and the courts in the southern district of texas are less congested
2133884 whether mcnamee falsely charged clemens with using steroids in new york texas or on the moon is of little consequence it simply does not change that mcnamees conduct was calculated to and did harm clemens where he lived and worked
2133885 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2133886 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2133887 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2133888 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2133889 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2133890 the new organization capabilities in vmware lab manager 3 will help us better enforce role based access rights to system configurations in the lab according to our it policy says tony anastasio technology architect for cerner the leading u
2133891 we have development teams working on trading gateways for virtually every major futures exchange around the world
2133892 vmware lab manager 3 gives us much more flexibility in the way we deal with a global lab environment it simplifies administration supports multiple networks and lets us assign resource pools and manage user access rights for all of our teams from a central location vmware lab manager has quickly become the industry standard virtual lab automation solution used by software development and testing teams worldwide said raghu raghuram vice president of products and solutions vmware this new release expands the appeal of vmware lab manager to more groups of people at our customers by promoting effective self service combined with centralized it control
2133893 if your child wants to talk about the army listen
2133894 how we fare in fighting aids will impact all our efforts to cut poverty and improve nutrition reduce child mortality and improve maternal health curb the spread of malaria and tuberculosis and strengthen health systems
2133895 aids is the most complex the most challenging and probably the most devastating infectious disease humanity has ever had to face and we have faced this disease we have rallied
2133896 the history of the response has been one of demanding action
2133897 identifying obstacles and unleashing the power to push these obstacles aside the activists set things sailing the international community stepped in to build the boat this is global solidarity
2133898 for the first time fewer people are dying of aids for the first time fewer people are becoming infected with hiv for the first time we have empirical evidence that our brilliant coalition can move mountains
2133899 this is cause for great encouragement but it is not cause for complacency and it is certainly far too early for declaring victory because the end of aids is nowhere in site
2133900 when historians look back on how the world responded to aids they will describe an unprecedented global mobilization in response to a health problem
2133901 african leadership in countries where discriminatory laws and policies are still in place would later fail to control the spread of the disease among homosexuals drug users and prostitutes
2133902 it is hard to acquire statistics from countries with such restrictive laws and policies in place i think it is the responsibility of civil society organisations to help change the situation
2133903 i think one of the prevention strategies includes community based interventions
2133904 the invisibility of men who have sex with other men in many low and middle income countries across the globe is contributing to inadequate resources being given to hiv prevention programmes despite msm accounting for significant proportions of new infections in those countries
2133905 homophobia continues to fuel the spread of hiv in countries with concentrated epidemics and in countries with generalized epidemics alike
2133906 our target groups for the event are school learners as well as out of school youth who are very sexually active in the southern town these young people need to be made aware of the dangers of the aids pandemic in a more pragmatic manner hence this gathering at the suiderlig secondary school hall
2133907 the biggest threat to children in families affected by hiv is the enormously impoverishing cost of the disease
2133908 sa is exemplary with 8 million children indirectly receiving grants
2133909 given that 12 million children under 18 years of age have lost one or both parents to aids this is an astonishingly forgotten group
2133910 the plight of children surely teaches us that we need to redefine the meaning of prevention prevention not only means action to eliminate the causes of hiv infection and aids itself it also means preventing the adverse human consequences of hiv and aids on children and families affected by the pandemic it is also a sad and unacceptable fact that children living with hiv are less likely to receive antiretroviral drugs than their adult counterparts reflecting yet again the low value that society and even the aids community places on children

2133915 the theme of this years festival is exploring black romance and sexuality in american cinema so we thought it would be interesting to take a look back and examine the first film in contemporary cinema to showcase a modern day love story featuring a sexy african american duo

2133917 should we ask him if he wants to play the other role
2133918 well how do we approach this from my perspective whos the girl i could get

2133920 i am delighted sanjay will be joining motorola as co ceo and as ceo of mobile devices and i look forward to partnering with him
2133921 they are dead deceased non living and never coming back
2133922 did you ever admire an empty headed writer for his or her mastery of the language no
2133923 remember that two great masters of language william shakespeare and james joyce wrote sentences which were almost childlike when their subjects were most profound
2133924 if a sentence no matter how excellent does not illuminate your subject in some new and useful way scratch it out
2133925 the writing style which is most natural for you is bound to echo the speech you heard when a child
2133926 i understand now that all those antique essays and stories with which i was to compare my own work were not magnificent for their datedness or foreignness but for saying precisely what their authors meant them to say
2133927 our audience requires us to be sympathetic and patient readers ever willing to simplify and clarify whereas we would rather soar high above the crowd singing like nightingales
2133928 apple does not compete in certain markets the budget or midrange midtowers to be specific so if you compare equivalent pieces of hardware dells xps m1330 to the macbook for instance youll find relative parity
2133929 apple does not compete in certain markets the budget or midrange midtowers to be specific
2133930 hardware sales may start to see a slight down slope
2133931 my macbook pro has broken twice in the year that ive had it
2133932 for the laptop you actually want the mac is cheaper
2133933 what idiot averages the prices of pcs and compares that to the average price of macs
2133934 and if your mac does catch a virus it does occasionally happen
2133935 this is simply a function of not being able to afford the really cool toy
2133936 the bottom line is that people like macs because they come with a level of engineering and customer service required for a 1 500 machine
2133937 edit and for the love of god build your own pcs

2133939 dont enjoy recompiling my kernel swapping out motherboards testing each dimm in the system individually to find out which one is bad swapping out video cards because the driver has flaked out or the card has gone bad
2133940 personal attacks on mac users and not by mac users
2133941 instead of complaining about the state of the education system as we correct the same mistakes year after year ive got a better idea
2133942 university teachers should simply accept as variant spelling those words our students most commonly misspell
2133943 there are enormous advantages in having a coherent system of spelling
2133944 racy historical novel about aisha the young wife of the prophet sic muhammad
2133945 disturbs us that we feel we cannot publish it right now
2133946 from credible and unrelated sources cautionary advice not only that the publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
2133947 if were about to publish something you dont like threaten us with violence and we wont publish it
2133948 i dont have a problem with historical fiction i do have a problem with the deliberate misinterpretation of history you cant play with a sacred history and turn it into soft core pornography
2133949 the correspondence that we received stated that it is their intention to pursue judicial review proceedings against the eight match suspension that was imposed on the player having been found to be in breach of the associations disciplinary procedures in respect of unacceptable conduct
2133950 we have now written to the club to tell them that unless proceedings have been initiated by 5pm on tuesday 12 august 2008 then the suspension will be applied
2133951 no one was wounded but some buildings have been destroyed
2133952 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2133953 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2133954 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2133955 cbeyond and paet both serve the enterprise and both build their networks out of leased circuits from other carriers
2133956 it was a real real bad case she had physical and medical problems and this could very well have been a fatality
2133957 but there is a positive spin long after people forgot about it our investigators were still working all the time they never forget
2133958 one of my first assignments as a newly hired 22 year old reporter for ford motor companys employee newspaper was to interview a senior vice president for a story about a new business venture
2133959 so what did i do i skipped over the customary introductory pleasantries and politely yet firmly asked him a very tough but pertinent question in this way i immediately established my credentials as an intelligent communications professional who had done his homework and was up to the challenge then i gave him my rapt attention and followed up with another probing question the svps manner quickly changed we had a productive interview and when it was over he said he would be pleased to make his people available to further flesh out the story
2133960 give her the message not to show up for court
2133961 to be taken away for this court date or to be taken away permanently
2133962 i told him dont do that he could go to hospital and we would help him in whatever he needed
2133963 the psychological component is very important in counselling people infected with hiv follow up is necessary in order to help the patient to face the aids problem normally
2133964 unfortunately we have only one psychologist for the entire province which has the highest hiv prevalence rate in the country and which receives many people returning from south africa already infected with the aids virus
2133965 this is an extremely difficult time for all of us that knew and loved ryan and i would ask that we are given the time and space to grieve in private
2133966 it was obviously a targeted shooting but the young man who was shot was not the target
2133967 as they were going in through the door two other black males barged past them at the same time three scooters were travelling along the pavement towards camberwell green and a number of shots were fired the victim was fatally shot in the back as he was going into the store
2133968 we are looking into the possibility that the two men who attempted to barge past were the intended targets we dont know who they are and were appealing for them to come forward
2133969 i didnt think anything bad was going to happen because i thought they were joking and laughing they didnt look scared or angry or anything but then i heard shots three or four ive never seen anyone get shot before
2133970 he had so much to look forward to his whole life was ahead of him its just really really sad
2133971 i didnt ever know him to get into any trouble my son and him were always talking and laughing together as my son would say he was a gentleman he didnt have any street name or anything like that
2133972 he was just a normal guy ive got two sons and im just so worried
2133973 there were a number of people in costcutter at the time some of whom we have identified i would appeal to anybody who was there or saw the mopeds coming along the pavement to contact police
2133974 we do not believe there was any reason why they would want to shoot him
2133975 he is just a young lad who went into a shop with his brothers and cousin and has been hit by a bullet
2133976 the actions by georgia in south ossetia bear witness to the fact that the leadership of that country can no longer be trusted
2133977 i offer you an immediate ceasefire and the immediate beginning of talks
2133978 i hope the day comes when you return to your wife and your daughters and your country
2133979 this has implications for our picture of neanderthals and perhaps the reasons for their extinction if the population was teetering on the brink for hundreds of thousands of years it maybe changes our impression of what it would have taken to make them go extinct rather than if there were millions of them
2133980 the changing landscape of australian art and the evolving cultural relationship with the united kingdom
2133981 his instinct is for going on as the bolder and more honourable course
2133982 what ae would like to do wd be to go to the broadcast and the tv and announce no election this year
2133983 the game really feels epic in a way that the burning crusade didnt burning crusade felt like an extension of the original game this really feels epic and that youre part of something grand
2133984 i think itll be just as big if not bigger
2133985 bc was the biggest selling pc game sequel ever i think wrath might be a little lower than that but therell certainly be lines for it
2133986 there will be a lot of pressure to buy it and anyone who has a character at the highest level will pretty much consider it a necessity
2133987 youll be walking through the barrens an area in wow and youll see a steam tank drive past you with five people sitting in it or youll see a death knight clad in frozen armor with five ghouls walking behind him this stuff is wrath only after seeing that who wouldnt want the expansion
2133988 they took it up a notch with the complexity of the scenes and the intricacy
2133989 they have some areas which are now misty which is a really interesting effect walking through a mist previously they had sort of grayed out the scene and called it mist but now its hard to peer through
2133990 theyve again taken the end game and made it more accessible to more people
2133991 without costing the high end players without giving up the challenge that keeps the high end players motivated
2133992 i think blizzard has learned a lot from the last expansion release
2133993 even a group of ten people will be able to conquer the very highest end game content while 25 man versions will let people who want to be more hardcore do that as well
2133994 if youre familiar with the mechanics of the 10 person version
2133995 then you should be familiar with the 25 person version at least in the philosophical sense
2133996 and reward people for doing things they wont normally bother doing
2133997 i know that on their side theyre going to have tons of results coming back that will be useful and which will undoubtedly speed up their development process
2133998 ethan your sound effects are awesome i really feel like its actually happening on my back
2133999 i didnt realize there was so much spit in star wars
2134000 he had a soul that is often missing in the business which has taken on much more of a corporate tone
2134001 where did i go right youre no one in hollywood unless someone wants you dead
2134002 we got a dead person a 250 a week raise i knew i was in the right business
2134003 you take care of everything and get them ready for the day
2134004 how do you take an actor or comedian or a writer and point them in the right direction and go through all that garbage unless you love it and love them and think theyre talented and worth it
2134005 i put about 20 films in development at lorimar and ended up making six lousy movies two good movies and one great movie
2134006 i cant get into details about other folks that are interested in this technology but as you might imagine of course there is more interest out there
2134007 only one of us could make it over the wall
2134008 when you make love to a woman you get revenge for all the things that defeated you in life
2134009 im playing a killer im not going to give anything else away
2134010 its a bank robbing movie so its one of those action packed films you get a little different side of me in that movie
2134011 its a new age young hip hop version of heat
2134012 these are young cool well dressed articulate bank robbers chris be the little homey
2134013 i did a big ride with my mum in the summer of 2000 she had a dream of cycling to italy and on her 40 th birthday we dipped our toes in the mediterranean sea this was after 19 days in the saddle all the way from sweden over the alps to finish in the italian city bibione the love for the bike was born and when i came home later that summer i signed up for my first triathlon i was last out of the pool after having done breaststroke for the full 400 meters but i was hooked
2134014 i always train with my heart rate monitor this season i have been using my garmin forerunner most but ive started to go back to my polar ive got the c600 on the bike and the rs800 for running i like to be able to upload the sessions and compare heart rates speeds etc trainingpeaks is a great help it allows me to update sessions from all the different gadgets i use i also really like fact that i can upload the runs on a map sometimes when training is hard you need those small things to look forward to
2134015 i would say its a lot like x men although theres some matrix as well
2134016 the pusher has the ability to alter your mind and change your thinking or certainly predict what youre about to do in the near future without you even knowing ahead of time
2134017 its kind of in the vein of that show heroes
2134018 its a group of individuals who have certain powers theyre either on the run or in hiding from this branch of the government called division that wants to capture these people and get their power for warfare
2134019 i play the character of a government agent who is the head of division
2134020 my character has powers also and is a pusher as well and so i hunt these people down and enhance their abilities to see the future whatever it is and i want to turn all of them into real soldiers
2134021 im going to be in a band no selena gomez stuff
2134022 im not going to be a solo artist i think that i dont want my name attached to it
2134023 i basically want to make music that is fun and that parents and kids can jump around to and have a good time to
2134024 i will be singing and im learning drums and playing electric guitar
2134025 i would like to try it and kind of switch it up
2134026 when i do the tour and stuff i would like to do maybe a section on the piano or on guitar or on drums
2134027 you know the jonas boys and people like demi lovato are my friends so i definitely would not copy or do anything that they did theyre really good obviously at what theyre doing so im going to let them have that but its also just kind of fun to learn things
2134028 knowing who im dating and what kind of cereal i eat aint gonna benefit anybody else that kind of thing is not important
2134029 people have different opinions on that type of thing i told you what mine is and i think for each person you do whats right for you for me part of the reason that i have anxiety is the fact that i feel like people are always staring at me so its important for me to make sure that i have my friends and vacation and what i do at home with my family and that type of thing stays private
2134030 that bloke from oasis said i couldnt play guitar somebody shoulda told him im a f in rock star

2134048 i dont know exactly what i want but i definitively know when i want it
2134049 it was like when your mum gets drunk and starts dancing
2134050 i guess this proves there are as many nuts in the academy as anywhere else
2134051 im just a girl from a trailer park who had a dream
2134052 we want to thank all of you for watching us congratulate ourselves tonight
2134053 you have to try these cookies from tracey amp dee

2134055 no one is pressuring her or coercing her in the slightest
2134056 she has a loving family here who has known her for 10 years they have become very close at the moment her only desire is to exercise her legal right to spend a little more time with the family
2134057 for the moment she has a valid visa and she is not breaking any immigration laws
2134058 im trying desperately to get the other 24 children back to belarus
2134059 she cant stay here it breaks the agreement she was here by for sure we see the situation like kidnapping
2134060 it was the host familys understandng that the grandmother wanted her to stay
2134061 he is the only person im acquainted with who subscribes to dorlands medical dictionary are mother goose to him
2134062 this is an important milestone for us many many things will change from this point onward
2134063 for the first time the people are getting to chose a president and we have ended the autocratic powers of the president
2134064 this is a significant milestone in the countrys reform process
2134065 the stark revelations of the last few days have reminded us yet again that we have terrorists in our midst still planning awful deeds
2134066 we must therefore never relax our vigilance against these extremists
2134067 let me assure kenyans that this government will do everything possible to prevent us from ever again being attacked
2134068 i do not know why i survived i do not know what god wants me to do
2134069 reinforces the need to confront the terrorists to work with our allies to bring them to justice and to prevent such attacks from happening again
2134070 we see them as they were as the opening of a new twilight struggle between hope and fear peace and hatred freedom and tyranny a struggle that has now finally fully been joined
2134071 and on that day we saw in response from our diplomats and development workers our soldiers and our citizens our friends and our allies what is best in humankind and why we shared why our shared values will prevail
2134072 if this is happening in kenya where at least we have rules and regulations imagine what the rest of africa is like
2134073 she was very good to me even buying clothes for the baby giving some money for food
2134074 he was standing in front of my face saying i had signed the documents and he wasnt even embarrassed
2134075 i will fight them in the courts here i will fight them in the courts in uganda

2134077 wow the washer did a really great job getting the water out of my clothes
2134078 wow it doesnt even smell like i washed these huh

2134085 die deutsche bank finanziert und unterst tzt uns in keiner weise
2134086 es ist offenkundig dass sich die deutsche bank mit dem dbv einen willf hrigen parallel betriebsrat h lt der von seiner struktur her mit der arbeitsgemeinschaft unabh ngiger betriebsr te aub bei siemens vergleichbar ist

2134089 i wonder what its like to stand on that stage seven times a week
2134090 ray when someone asks you if youre a god you say yes
2134091 i will not vote positive on a bill that would take away the rights of future boards of commissioners to provide law enforcement
2134092 we are not ready to move forward with the future of law enforcement
2134093 i was looking out for the interest of the taxpayers and the public
2134094 i dont want to apologize for doing things the way they were supposed to be done
2134095 i will cooperate fully with this board or any other board to ensure public safety
2134096 the only thing im interested in is whats best for public safety
2134097 this is just denying the people the right to vote on such an important issue as public safety
2134098 we had an area scout go see him and then rusty saw him and he was hitting 95 mph and 98 mph

2134102 un member states can change the world by creating a powerful womens agency
2134103 its not a panacea for the injustices faced by women worldwide but it would ensure that in every issue involving women there would be a voice and a vehicle especially at country level to identify injustices and advance the struggle for womens rights

2134114 it is a sad fact but that means that kinder surprise eggs have to go
2134115 there is absolutely no evidence that the kinder surprise eggs as a combination of toy and foodstuff are dangerous
2134116 the kinder surprise toy is separated from the chocolate by a plastic capsule
2134117 we have seen no evidence that the eggs are dangerous
2134118 do you think the combination of sweets and food is dangerous
2134119 your bonus this year is that youve still got a job
2134120 we believe the bank of england really had little option other than to keep interest rates at 5
2134121 the ever growing likelihood of recession calls for lower interest rates yet this is precluded by elevated inflation levels and risks elevated inflation levels and risks call for higher interest rates yet this would increase the danger of a deeper extended recession best therefore to sit tight for the time being nevertheless there could well have been a three way split in the vote again
2134122 i think we are going into recession and we are probably in one right now its not too late to stop it but we have to act right now
2134123 monetary policy has been far too tight for too long
2134124 annual inflation rates are likely to remain above levels consistent with price stability over a protracted period of time and risks to price stability in the medium term remain on the upside

2134126 at the time of these events iain burns was the head of pr at british airways with no responsibility for pricing decisions given his very high level of cooperation to the oft iain is naturally disappointed with their decision however he hopes that it will allow this case to be fully analysed before a court and finally provide him with the opportunity to clear his name
2134127 we are so pleased that these accomplished artists are collaborating with elvis in this unique way to make exciting new versions of his christmas songs
2134128 i am sure elvis would be proud to have worked with them
2134129 our shareholders have had to endure a lot we are and we will be working as hard as we can to create the conditions that enable a higher price to be placed on our shares over time
2134130 the financial results for this quarter were severe due to our rapidly changing business environment

2134132 we have asked our advertising partners to work with us to eliminate low value work and to find creative solutions to go to market more efficiently
2134133 if you examined the bt report and accounts you would have seen that my share options packages were due to come to fruition all at once in 2009 i had concluded i was going to go and do some charity work and some non executive things but three months into my new role i realised i hated it and i really wanted to be an operating chief executive which was a bit unfortunate
2134134 the centre was off buying businesses and they were relying on the margins from the uk to justify the whole thing and there was a lot of pressure in the organisation not to hear bad news
2134135 martin has many strengths strategically but i think there was a group of people who just thought its too hard to tell martin this
2134136 what we should be able to show in the figures are the milestones have we built up more people offshore how have orders been getting on have we recruited the people we said we would recruit in our high growth areas do we have the sales people shareholders are interested mainly because they are looking for a company that says we are going to do this and actually does it
2134137 as companies face threats they are increasingly turning to it solutions to resolve their issues
2134138 i dont expect us to be directly competitive at least for another five years
2134139 it was a real mess and i went to pitch to bland assuming i was about to get shot and i think christopher took me on assuming he was going to shoot me
2134140 im never quite sure how life would be different if id chosen differently
2134141 there are so many accidents in life when you look back at it but i am glad it has turned out the way it has
2134142 okay we gotta do this but make it go away
2134143 the results are disappointing but at the current share price we do not believe that there is much downside risk
2134144 on a 12 month view we believe the shares will recover to our target price of 102p
2134145 this is an opportunistic move by xstrata which attempts to capitalise on the volatility in financial and metal markets
2134146 it undervalues lonmins unique business and fails to deliver appropriate value for lonmins shareholders

2134170 i had enough of people trying to hurt me and harass me
2134171 ill probably have to do it myself but i want to see all forms of bullying illegal
2134172 we have harassment through telephone in the criminal code we have harassing people by letters we say the criminal code is silent on new technology
2134173 the laws in the criminal code were all written years ago lets update it where its necessary
2134174 id be very careful about making online bullying a crime
2134175 the most severe forms of cyberbullying are already captured in the criminal code
2134176 we do have freedom of expression in canada and that means sometimes you can say unpopular and even nasty things and there is a line thats crossed
2134177 that line is already in the criminal code and im not quite sure why we need a specific law targeting the internet
2134178 as someone who has been bullied for 11 and a half years im not sure how you can express yourself through bullying
2134179 its something that should have been done a long time ago
2134180 if you can get charged for bullying physically you should be able to get charged in regards to the form of cyberbullying
2134181 when i brought it up with the school i kept a copy of the chat log where they threatened me
2134182 they said there were no charges that could be laid because it was online if it had happened in person they could have pressed charges that was one time when i was let down by the justice system
2134183 i know that they dont believe in criminalizing it alone
2134184 education of teachers parents and students of the new cyber playground
2134185 its not so much social networking its having a social experience around things that we care about so pets are just such a great example of that
2134186 social networks like facebook and myspace are sort of about you and your friends and these very direct connections but theres all sorts of other types of connections
2134187 theres a lot of people out there with their dogs and were busy and were all working in the office all day long and this is a way for us to bring our pets with us
2134188 its been a goofy thing to do at the end of the day when you get home from work and you just want to talk to somebody in your dogs voice and say hey how was your day
2134189 my dog sits near the computer while i do the work for him
2134190 even when you go to the fake site it has their name and profile picture right on the site so you really believe it
2134191 its affecting what is arguably the most popular service among canadian web surfers to the best of my knowledge we havent really seen a facebook virus of this magnitude yet
2134192 i dont have any specific numbers but i do expect that it will spread rapidly given the popularity of the social networks
2134193 the implicit trust built into the social circle of friends and the willingness to share information with those in the circle will only the help the social engineering attacks to succeed
2134194 what this trojan does is it tries to steal a persons online gaming credentials
2134195 what they can do with these stolen gaming accounts is sell them online
2134196 it would steal your user name and password and send it back to whoever is sending this thing out

2134203 as more and more content is being uploaded to the internet people are putting themselves in the drivers seat instead of waiting for websites to serve up the content
2134204 we wont allow the death of our compatriots go unpunished
2134205 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located
2134206 we urge restraint on all sides that violence would be curtailed and that direct dialogue could ensue in order to help resolve their differences
2134207 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2134208 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2134209 separatists opened fire in response to yesterdays peaceful initiative of the president of georgia
2134210 we want the international community to talk to the russians and tell them that aggression against georgia is unacceptable
2134211 units of the 58th army have set off to help russian peacekeepers they are approaching tskhinvali
2134212 georgian troops are shooting russian peacekeepers and civilians at observation posts they have seized
2134213 vicious fighting is going on in the area of tskhinvali where georgian tanks are firing at the peacekeepers headquarters and base from close by
2134214 to make it clear to russia that invading a sovereign countrys territory is unacceptable in the 21st century
2134215 we have indisputable evidence that a large scale military operation will start here by september this is georgias plan currently being implemented by president mikheil saakashvilis regime
2134216 the security council will consider as soon as possible proposals to settle the situation in the region
2134217 the situation is very sad it raises concerns and will certainly incur a response
2134218 russia must interfere in the conflict to stop the violence
2134219 russia must consider a military operation because our peacekeeping contingent will not be enough to ensure peace in the region
2134220 let people who long for battles in gaza not worry they will take place
2134221 we warn barak and his government of losers against short sighted steps for which a high price is to be paid security cannot be reached through crime and terror
2134222 are planned at 8 5 billion this year 2008 and i think we will fully meet the plan and even exceed it
2134223 our foreign customers are queuing up for new russian made weaponry
2134224 among our main 10 15 customers are china india almost all middle east countries algeria morocco and venezuela
2134225 when poland signs a treaty with the united states on the deployment of missile defense elements then we will be in a position to discuss some additional aspects of military cooperation with belarus
2134226 we are preparing the flights of our strategic aircraft to the indian ocean to practice interoperability with the russian navy task force in the region
2134227 since august 2007 russian strategic bombers have carried out about 150 patrol flights with tactical interference of foreign aircraft which accompanied our planes on their missions and in some instances jeopardized the success of these missions
2134228 obviously as weve stated before we are looking for a clear positive response from iran and in the absence of that we are going to have no choice than to pursue further measures against them as part of our dual track strategy
2134229 no one can deny that enrichment in the framework of npt is irans inalienable right
2134230 the olympic games should be cause for celebration the decision to hold the games in beijing is beyond comprehension
2134231 with china underwriting the suffering in darfur and hosting the olympic games at home there is an incongruity that everyone attending the game participating in the games and covering the games cant ignore
2134232 stop being the enabler of genocide in darfur and start putting pressure and using leverage on khartoum to stop the violence to protect civilians and to bring about a lasting peace
2134233 china is everywhere around here even the needle here is chinese
2134234 but to me as a citizen i see little of chinas money
2134235 these devices are a great way to get quick results in the privacy of your own home you dont have to make an appointment to go to the spa especially if there isnt one in your immediate area
2134236 light renewal works to generate energy within those cells thereby making them more productive and efficient
2134237 the result is a visibly improved appearance of fine lines and wrinkles and improved appearance of skin texture tone and firmness
2134238 led treatments like revital light are not as effective as the promises being made
2134239 they make a minimal improvement unless you use the devices for 30 minutes a session almost daily who has the time for that these devices are like at home exercise equipment that wind up being used as a hanger and take up space customers should save their money
2134240 substantial numbers of respondents report not having found any anti aging products that work for them even if they continue to seek them out
2134241 there have been few clinical studies conducted on these devices
2134242 but the majority of these products are not dangerous because they use an insignificant amount of low light therapy or electrical stimulation they are more harmful to your pocket book than anything else
2134243 non sei capace di portare avanti nessuna iniziativa per pi di due settimane prima parti sparata come se non dovesse fermarti niente e nessuno e poi come una macchina scassata ti blocchi neanche a met strada
2134244 ricordi il corso di ceramista quello che avevi iniziato a frequentare perch male che vada sempre un possibile sbocco professionale tre lezioni e poi sa il cazzo perch hai deciso di piantare tutto
2134245 e dopo che ti abbiamo foraggiato per lennesima volta tu che fai
2134246 lo sai qual la verit quelle come te non concluderanno mai nulla di buono anzi non concluderanno mai nulla e basta
2134247 le abbiamo provate tutte e lo sai benissimo per cercare di recuperarti alla normalit ma non c stato niente da fare
2134248 sei incostante volubile capricciosa viziata accidenti a me e a quello stronzo di tuo padre senza un briciolo di orgoglio e senza alcuno stimolo per andare avanti
2134249 sei priva di equilibrio ma non cos tanto per dire sei assolutamente totalmente irrevocabilmente squilibrata
2134250 potrei mai fare quello che sto facendo se fossi squilibrata come dice
2134251 its not the face but the expressions on it its not the voice but what you say its not how you look in that body but the things you do with it
2134252 she was so small she was sneaking under the fence from the little dog play group to the big dogs
2134253 i hired a psychic for her who does really good work with lost pets
2134254 for you dog lovers out there imagine coming home and hearing nothing silence and not knowing whether your dog is even alive my friend is in total anguish
2134255 they are praying for me lots of them came to the door to door search
2134256 just sit your behinds down and stay out of the road were making history here how do you like your eggs
2134257 it is categorically untrue that lor al paris altered ms knowles features or skin tone in the campaign
2134258 there is no doubt that anyone seeing that ad will know that it is beyonc
2134259 i dont know in a way yes and in a way no
2134260 the last thing i want is someone to think oh they had to go back to puppets because that was the best album and theyre doing it because we want it if we start writing songs for our fans somethings gone wrong the fans may think they know best but hey im the armchair quarterback when im watching my team too at the end of the day we have to write it because we love it and its coming from our heart thats why people connect with it if you start doing it for the fans youve lost the plot
2134261 we recognize there was an essence there was a youth there was a something about that record and this is a perfect time for a record like this
2134262 because old school metal is huge and coming back and theres so many people wanting to play and get riffy again get solo i love that so with this record its like us starting over again
2134263 his mission statement was to get to the essence of metallica
2134264 what made sense to us was the hunger the quest to impress
2134265 he said youre going to write a set list your next album is a set list of your best songs and youre going to try and go get signed do a showcase and impress people and that was a great mission statement for us
2134266 its possible but we just go with our feelings every time
2134267 you cant go wrong if you go with your heart and thats pretty much it were very comfortable with our fanbase sorting itself out we dont have to make sure theyre happy because thats like trying to control the world you cant do it if people connect with what youre doing theyll be there if they dont like this record they might go away and thats ok that means theres a seat for someone else
2134268 we were looking at the past and seeing what worked for us and updating that sound
2134269 theres always been a melodic side to metallica a side that has been reflected in a desire to break free from any of those stereotypes and to just go where we could go musically and creatively
2134270 i think some of what weve done goes against a lot of the conservative elements in heavy metal and hard rock thinking and thats ok
2134271 justice obviously was a huge record for us we took the ride the lightning and master of puppets concept as far as we could take it
2134272 there was no place else to go with the progressive nutty sideways side of metallica and im so proud of the fact that in some way that album is kind of the epitome of that progressive side of us up through the 80s
2134273 theres a certain kind of specific sound to that record peculiar sound whichever adverb you want to choose thats given it a kind of life of its own and a little bit of a vibe all its own there have been a lot of great musicians we admire whove come up and talked about what a great inspiration that album has been to them and to their sound its obviously awesome to be part of that that album also sent us on this whole other merry way because when we came back from touring on that record in 1989 we were like we have nothing more to offer on this side of metallica and that set us off on some other adventures when i think of the nine records weve put out its impossible for me to think of the music without thinking of the experience and when i think of the experience i have warm and fuzzy feelings but i also have questions obviously justice is well revered especially among a lot of our peers
2134274 that album songwriting wise it was just us really showing off and trying to show what we could do
2134275 weve jammed six riffs into one song lets make it eight lets go crazy with it i listen to some of that stuff and its pretty progressive sonically it has its shortcomings but that is the one where we were able to step forward from
2134276 we mixed that record while we were on the road
2134277 thats not an excuse for the way that it sounds but our ears were beat anywhere i go whenever i ask someone what their favorite record is someones bound to say justice its pretty great that across the line someone can jump into your history and feel comfortable
2134278 id have to go song by song i was just listening to 1997s reload and there are a couple of songs on there that i think are absolutely brilliant but as an album itself and as a time justice just isnt a good memory for me but those songs are good i have to try and erase the memory of that experience somehow and let the songs take me
2134279 its always the next one i think the forthcoming is great but theres always a better something the holy grail of guitar sounds i havent got there yet but i will on the next one ill write the ultimate song on the next one the hunger is always there to do it better
2134280 i dont have an excuse i just need a little help
2134281 due to various reasons it wasnt working out with us and him
2134282 we felt his heart was no longer in it after expressing his want to leave on numerous occasions this year which showed when he played live
2134283 we still do but we were in love with each other for two years he was basically my 24 7 we were arguing a lot and it really wasnt fun
2134284 i was so sad i just went into this weird funk and i dyed my hair black
2134285 when we were dating nick wanted me to get highlights and so i did that and i got myself looking great
2134286 and then on the day we broke up i was like i want to make my hair black now i dont want to look pretty i want to look hard core
2134287 since the breakup ive realized that ive met so many great guys but i like being the girl nobody can have
2134288 no one can touch me no ones mine im myself i think its sexy to do your own thing
2134289 maybe hell be my best friend for the rest of my life
2134290 i got my artist tay dizm and ive already got his single beam me up featuring me and rick ross ive also got young cash coming out right now jay lyriq ive got a lot of stuff coming on my nappy boy label
2134291 i just worked on ciaras album me and kanye did it again we did another hook like two days ago
2134292 i got two records with t pain that are retarded

2134299 its about finding yourself and doing what you want to do and being true to yourself
2134300 and i think for a lot of people its difficult to do that
2134301 i definitely like trying on different clothes in terms of sound
2134302 i wouldnt want to repeat the next record either i really like so many types of recording styles and so many different types of music and stuff i think it would be a waste of time to try and find a sound and duplicate it you know what i mean i dont want to become a one trick band or anything like that
2134303 he thinks its some kind of game for him im very angry with him ive had a partnership with black hat for three years
2134304 the design of the network was to isolate it from the rest of the public network its not designed to isolate it from one computer in the press room to another computer in the press room
2134305 if they want to bring the charges lets go its the only way to get it resolved
2134306 i dont claim to have a good understanding of what your responsibilities are but i have to look at how the court system is run and perceived by the public
2134307 detroits government will continue to operate as usual trash will continue to be collected recreation centers will remain open grass will be cut and fires will be extinguished
2134308 levi was gonna stay home but then he said dad mom i wanna go support moms purses at 30 days old hes talking about stuff like that

2134310 we went 14 hours with no epidural having contractions every two

2134313 a soldier of slight build who comes from new york
2134314 it gives us an opportunity to look back at the 1970s through the filter of 2009
2134315 the issues of privacy and individuality and issues of spying and listening are as relevant now as theyve ever been this is the perfect vehicle to tell those stories
2134316 if it was mutt williams it would be mutt williams and the search for elvis or something
2134317 we are looking for something for him to go after
2134318 they are very hard to find its like archeology it takes a huge amount of research to come up with something that will fit
2134319 almost 40 per cent of the calls where were going the material is not there
2134320 if people are going by cherry picking taking the most valuable items it causes us concerns
2134321 what theyre taking is small in comparison to these commercial operations
2134322 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
2134323 i dont mind as long as i can still find everything in the store
2134324 i dont think its very relevant i dont think everything is that fresh
2134325 the dominion name stopped having any brand equity years ago
2134326 dominion did have that trust and heritage it had been a great brand but it was tired they recognized that they felt they could improve on it and though it would be by and large a name change they could also demonstrate changes that would make it better
2134327 i whispered back to him i know i know what you did
2134328 i love him so much i just wish he could be good once in a while
2134329 it makes me sick to my stomach i have a daughter whos 12 so hearing the charges horrified me
2134330 he said he was abducted at gunpoint they threw him in the van then they threw him out of the van and he blacked out
2134331 he said that he doesnt mean to do it that he had never killed anyone would never harm anyone
2134332 if they say he abducted a 12 year old i hope they throw him in jail and throw away the key
2134333 we are saying that these are community assets and a part of the infrastructure and we are willing to provide funding while the working group is looking at a longer term solution
2134334 the desire of the citizen for elements one no longer dares to ask for conviviality joy delight in wonder the shared forum of imagining and play of unreserved laughter and serenity all the playful and ecstatic registers that justify city life
2134335 establish its sovereignty over all of its territory and for lebanese and non lebanese militias to
2134336 this is meant to be a national unity government so i think in a sense what came out yesterday was basically a compromise
2134337 i wouldnt put it in so many words as caving in to hezbollah it needed a compromise statement that could sort of get the support and consensus of all the parties concerned
2134338 hezbollah is a party in this government it has ministers in this government so the statement couldnt come out without a reference the right of the lebanese people to resist and also the right to liberate occupied lands of course in reference to shebaa farms
2134339 this cooperative effort which began july 27 partially destroyed the remnants of al qaida in iraq along the northern tigris river valley and brought a prolonged military presence to the people in those regions not seen in over three years
2134340 this is the first time that we have had iraqi security forces and coalition forces in hegnah because of their commitment to our people we are able to live in peace and begin rebuilding our lives without fear
2134341 we will always be grateful for the sacrifices of lieutenant colonel vaneks soldiers they died so that we can live
2134342 what remains clear is no budget has been established to assist this area with infrastructure needs although the province and district have sizeable purses
2134343 we need to get some form of representative government established in taq taq or we will continue to see that area of salahuddin susceptible to al qaida in iraq exploitation and usage as a safe haven
2134344 if we can at least get the process started for these people that will be the single most enduring accomplishment we will have fulfilled in this operation
2134345 the coalition has decided that it will immediately initiate impeachment proceedings against the president and present a charge sheet against him
2134346 in view of president musharrafs wrong policies and failure to get vote of confidence from the newly elected assemblies as per commitment given by him to the supreme court the coalition leadership has decided to move impeachment proceedings against him
2134347 in spite of his clear cut commitment that if his party was defeated in the elections he would resign musharraf continues to cling to the office of the president this is despite the fact that he made a clear cut commitment before the supreme court that he will get vote of confidence from newly elected assemblies
2134348 incompetence and failure of his policies threw the country into worst power shortage in its history his policies have weakened the federation and he is working to undermine transition to democracy
2134349 the coalition leadership is further resolved to restore all judges removed through extra constitutional means by general musharraf on november 5 last year strictly in accordance with the murree declaration immediately after impeachment of the president
2134350 the coalition partners also expressed their resolve to implement the charter of democracy and work together to steer the country on the path of constitutional governance
2134351 theyre for defensive purposes were not going to attack anybody
2134352 any gringo ship that sails into brown waters river waters will itself turn brown and go to the bottom because theyll not get through
2134353 i do not think any single organization or any single meeting is going to solve all these problems
2134354 but i think every organization and every meeting should try to make a direct contribution and that is what the saarc leaders have pledged themselves to do together and that is what we as observers are trying to work with them to do
2134355 this summit has rekindled the hope and belief among our peoples regarding the delivery and prosperity that we collectively promised 23 years ago
2134356 there is no bombing of tskhinvali street battles are continuing in the city involving our soldiers we do not plan to bomb our own servicemen in tskhinvali
2134357 most of south ossetias territory has been liberated and is now controlled by georgia i call on russia to stop bombarding peaceful georgian towns
2134358 is heading a meeting to discuss a series of urgent measures to stop the violence in south ossetia to protect the civilian population and russian citizens in the conflict zone
2134359 the goal of georgias actions in the conflict zone is to establish peace in the region and we will not stop until we have attained this goal

2134362 billy blackburns treasure chest rare home movies and special memories part 2
2134363 but we are hoping to have an agreement in place by late fall
2134364 its a substantial investment and it only makes sense that we would want to reach as many customers as possible with our new services
2134365 we will be negotiating with them to determine where they start
2134366 in the future we will look to see what we can do to expand offerings
2134367 we think we are very competitive and when you get competition consumers win
2134368 we knew this was coming and were going to compete for every inch of the territory
2134369 it was a management move and they were going to bring somebody in
2134370 the downtime was great you might have a week and a half where you werent busy and if i wanted to plan a trip or something i could
2134371 but the downside of being self employed is that when you dont work you dont get paid any money by anybody the opportunity to get into a steady employment situation with kdka was a godsend so i was very thankful to have it
2134372 that to me is one of the upsides about having a foot in the door for that length of time
2134373 she says its amazing how much you can get done between 2 a
2134374 i like the morning scenario because its a more lively time you can have a little more fun and joke around when everything is right
2134375 we know people are just waking up and starting their day with us looking forward to that first cup of coffee we have a chance to be bright and cheerful and share a laugh with them along the way
2134376 i have great respect for their knowledge and abilities and talents
2134377 i dont think of myself as being the old guy because im simpatico with them as far as my sense of humor and things i like talking about i see them as peers and friends i dont see them as people im a guardian for or mentoring
2134378 to be working with that storied franchise is quite exciting
2134379 were going to concentrate on doing the show for amy now because there is not enough hours in the day for us to do three shows at the same time
2134380 we had agreed to come up with a new show
2134381 as we came up with ideas we had ideas that were appropriate for a spinoff we had ideas that were similar but not actually a spinoff to do a spinoff you have to have a believable idea of why a scranton paper salesman would go out into the world
2134382 it wasnt one of the ideas that could connect her back to the office
2134383 as a companion piece to the office so if you watched them in the same night youd be satisfied
2134384 i dont really want to answer that take that answer for what you will
2134385 we had always planned that the end of the series would involve noah returning because he was so central as a new character at the very beginning an entering character growing up in the er
2134386 so we pulled out those old notes and came out with a lot of new things
2134387 math from a literacy perspective where we tie math words into our vocabulary
2134388 a fun addition that will have lots of cool math words to offer
2134389 he comes in not immediately as the boss but he has an interesting genetic profile that in certain sort of medical contexts theyve noticed that many times serial killers have that same genetic profile and this gentleman knows this about himself and is sort of in this journey and and to discover who his true character will ultimately become
2134390 we have made lifelong friends so this has been the best experience ever
2134391 its an eight part documentary series and its showing a conscious lifestyle still obviously wild and fun
2134392 shes the greatest american dog to me anyways even though she doesnt have the title she still has my heart

2134396 the officers ill put forward to you are the ones who shot donte jones
2134397 in the beginning gay men in places like san francisco and new york proved we could do prevention when we moved from that and started talking about the broad scope of the epidemic suddenly men who have sex with men became marginalized
2134398 they havent lived through the earlier days of the epidemic
2134399 this is a virus that is transmitted more easily via anal sex than vaginal sex
2134400 i wish i could control the thoughts in my mind
2134401 when im being eaten alive inside i always try to put on a good front here at work and at home so i dont spread the pestilence
2134402 he was a good scientist working in an area that not a whole lot of people wanted to fool with back then nobody ever doubted his work

2134405 the nature of biological weapons is such that it is very difficult to figure out where something came from
2134406 we dont know what techniques were used to link the samples
2134407 there are a lot of weird little details that are tantalizing but unexplained
2134408 there was a folding table in his way and he shoved that table about one foot away it shocked me because he always does things right that was the most violent act i ever saw him do
2134409 no one who attended the service could believe that dr ivins committed any crime
2134410 ivins mentored a number of young scientists during his career he was known for his patience and enthusiasm for science
2134411 shes pretty without makeup wears converse and says quirky and aggressive things
2134412 so when are you going to kiss fuck lick my c
2134413 the one armed eastern european taxidermist housekeeper with a codeine habit who used to be a child star
2134414 the transgendered old man with a shady past and an interest in concert films
2134415 we are confident that dr ivins was the only person responsible for these attacks
2134416 based upon the totality of the evidence we had gathered against him we are confident that dr ivins was the only person responsible for these attacks
2134417 the spores used in the attacks were taken from that specific flask regrown purified dried and loaded into the letters
2134418 no one received material from that flask without going through dr ivins
2134419 dr bruce ivins has unrestricted access to the suite and has been the sole custodian of rmr 1029 since it was first grown
2134420 i went to the mayo clinic and the doctors said we have found a dozen or so other people with this theres no name so maybe well just call it the warren syndrome
2134421 i dont see them doing it with an episcopal bishop or a cardinal or another evangelical
2134422 i want whats good for everybody not just whats good for me whos the best for the nation right now
2134423 the greatest most comprehensive and most biblical vision for world missions ive ever heard or read about
2134424 we really try to make sure that everybody is hitting at a speed that is appropriate for them
2134425 thats a lot of responsibility to ask an athlete to not only represent your country and perform and try to win a gold meal and to have a political view
2134426 politicians should be dealing with this stuff not the athletes
2134427 they might for the first time be hearing about this stuff they dont have a reference point
2134428 the athletes are doing the right thing as far as focusing on sport
2134429 they have a small window its not that they dont care it just takes so much focus so much energy to make an olympic games their heads are in the right place
2134430 being part of the conversation doesnt cost a whole lot
2134431 all young individuals should be aware of the situation the circumstances in which they are becoming involved in
2134432 its something they have to study and become well versed in its an obligation
2134433 im willing to talk about it while most athletes arent
2134434 the last i would ever want any athlete to do is to say they dont know
2134435 there are still too many unanswered questions i still cant say that one person did all of this
2134436 i do respect what they did with the families but we should have the same opportunity because any of us could have died in that building
2134437 we have some negotiating opportunities and rather than focus almost entirely on sanctions we should focus on what those opportunities should be
2134438 we would have preferred a more straightforward and positive answer from our iranian colleagues
2134439 the letter that we received yesterday appears to be a stalling tactic
2134440 ive not been able to get any traction on this for eight years
2134441 weve gone through seven years of really really tough times im part of the 2001 class and its been difficult
2134442 if you look at where we were in the late 80s and early 90s crime was out of control
2134443 thats how we got 94 passed and thats how were going to get 08 through
2134444 if al qaeda came into the country and was murdering 50 kids a day we would have more money than we know what to do with
2134445 as the feds withdraw it is no surprise there has been a rise in crime violent crime
2134446 the u s is looking to streamline the command and control by making mckiernan essentially in charge of all u s forces in afghanistan so that one person can deploy them in support of the overall mission
2134447 your sentence should say the united states will hunt you down and give you a harsh but appropriate sentence if you provide material support for terrorism
2134448 earlier this week obama told an audience make no mistake the oil companies have placed their bet on senator mccain it looks like edwards admits to affair
2134449 these incendiary and personal attacks have no place in our politics and will do nothing to help the good people of tennessee
2134450 its time to turn the page on a politics driven by negativity and division so that we can come together to lift up our communities and our country
2134451 while hes in our churches clapping his hands and tapping his feet hes the only senator who thought our kids shouldnt be allowed to pray in school congressman sometimes apologies just arent enough
2134452 to a certain extent the ads are having some effect
2134453 but you cant be thrown off your game plan by a momentary dip in polls
2134454 i think theyve crystallized their message and i think theyre hitting a nerve
2134455 the most private person to run for president since calvin coolidge in the 1920s
2134456 mr mccain offers little biography while mr obama is nothing but
2134457 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2134458 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2134459 no saben qu hacer con el dinero pero les han dicho que tienen que estar en internet
2134460 we would never disrespect authority or disrespect brown theres no way in the world
2134461 you dont go to jail because you like different restaurants do you
2134462 you feel that youre entitled to the favor of god to do things other people cant do
2134463 my friends we will disagree on a specific issue and thats healthy
2134464 i believe in renewable fuels i dont believe in ethanol subsidies but i believe in renewable fuels
2134465 agriculture products here in the state of iowa can feed the world and were not afraid to compete with anybody
2134466 this is the heartland of america this is what america is all about this is the people i want to know and meet
2134467 he voted against ethanol subsidies hes opposed to the farm bill
2134468 what it proves is he doesnt care about whats important to iowa
2134469 america is hurting right now weve got a lot of work to do
2134470 just as i have opposed additional consolidation in air passenger service i have serious concerns about the ups dhl alliance my concerns include the transactions effects on service costs consumer choice and jobs
2134471 this alliance is likely to eliminate two cargo air carriers abx and astar which now serve dhl and compete with ups this would lessen or even eliminate competition between ups and dhl in providing overnight package delivery services
2134472 part of the old tired politics of a party in washington that has run out of ideas and run out of steam
2134473 its not that youre not ready is not ready yet because when it comes to the economy experience matters and he just doesnt have it he says hell give you change but thats what hell leave you with
2134474 some tunnels want 100 a box some just 70 you have to compare prices
2134475 a tunnel can bring in a mobile phone but it cant bring in raw materials
2134476 its just a matter of time until they make a tunnel an elephant can walk through
2134477 barack obamas ten point plan to change the second amendment
2134478 are not in fact his campaign positions and in many cases the list seems flatly to contradict them how the group reaches those conclusions is unclear
2134479 some tunnels want 100 a box some just 70 you have to compare prices
2134480 a tunnel can bring in a mobile phone but it cant bring in raw materials
2134481 its just a matter of time until they make a tunnel an elephant can walk through
2134482 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2134483 whatever decision is made its going to be a collaborative decision
2134484 i think all this sort of speculation is much ado about very little
2134485 were just working out the details however those details play out that doesnt change the bottom line the fact that everyones on the same team here
2134486 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2134487 you could argue that no ones ever ready to be president i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year you could argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can ever be fully ready for the pressures of the office and that everyone learns something and something different you could argue that
2134488 what the deputies committee has raised is given the possibility that political fragmentation in pakistan is going to continue do we need to change our strategy
2134489 the argument that we may destabilize pakistan has taken us to where we are right now
2134490 pursuing the policy of public praise and private pressure on pakistan doesnt work
2134491 we need to enhance the capacity of hitting these targets
2134492 knowing who im dating and what kind of cereal i eat aint gonna benefit anybody else that kind of thing is not important
2134493 people have different opinions on that type of thing i told you what mine is and i think for each person you do whats right for you for me part of the reason that i have anxiety is the fact that i feel like people are always staring at me so its important for me to make sure that i have my friends and vacation and what i do at home with my family and that type of thing stays private
2134494 only one of us could make it over the wall
2134495 when you make love to a woman you get revenge for all the things that defeated you in life
2134496 knowing who im dating and what kind of cereal i eat aint gonna benefit anybody else that kind of thing is not important
2134497 people have different opinions on that type of thing i told you what mine is and i think for each person you do whats right for you for me part of the reason that i have anxiety is the fact that i feel like people are always staring at me so its important for me to make sure that i have my friends and vacation and what i do at home with my family and that type of thing stays private
2134498 it is categorically untrue that lor al paris altered ms knowles features or skin tone in the campaign
2134499 there is no doubt that anyone seeing that ad will know that it is beyonc
2134500 at the core of the record i thought it might be kind of cool to have an element that was kind of unpolished and have the other musicians play around that
2134501 so that became the springboard for the sound of the record with me banging away on the keys
2134502 over the years ive built it up to the point where i have a cult following for lack of a better term
2134503 i dont have a huge following but for the most part theyre very into it so thats encouraging and thats really all you can ask for these days
2134504 it is categorically untrue that lor al paris altered ms knowles features or skin tone in the campaign
2134505 there is no doubt that anyone seeing that ad will know that it is beyonc
2134506 handle every stressful situation like a dog if you cant eat it ot hump it piss on it and walk away
2134507 i have no idea what you are asking about i have responded to consistently to these tabloid allegations by saying i dont respond to these lies
2134508 its a sad story but infidelity happens all the time and causes grief in families every day
2134509 i did keep a copy of the outfit the t shirt i wore was designed by the director david gordon green and its a shark with a kitten in its mouth but theyre both smiling
2134510 we completely created that shirt and that shark david wanted me to wear a purple monterey bay t shirt with a whale on it i said i wasnt into the whale shirt so he came up with his own design which was the shark
2134511 the seth rogen james franco rosie perez at ny premiere of pineapple express found this 24 hours ago on

2134513 make sure that every market in the world is open to your products
2134514 this agricultural products in the state of iowa can feed the world and were not afraid to compete with anybody in the world my friends

2134516 he couldnt understand why they hadnt made it more true to life
2134517 he said some of the details were very accurate the materials how they did the tunnelling the confined spaces but they made up a lot of the plot and he didnt like that at all
2134518 i phoned the police in bristol and they came round pretty promptly they took the gun away to be decommissioned but when they heard who it belonged to they refused to charge the usual fee before they returned it to me
2134519 one of my great regrets now is that we didnt persuade my father to write a book he had a fantastic memory until quite recently and i found meticulous records he kept in the camp including many photographs i think they must have got hold of a german camera by barter details of everyday life and lists of every wine he knew about that he planned to taste when he got out he remembered life in the camp and relations with the germans as pretty good he was an excellent cricketer which they organised by county so he led for the stalag iii somerset he was devastated when hitler had 50 of the recaptured prisoners murdered including seven very good friends
2134520 during a conversation on monday afternoon the parties agreed to continue discussions launched in geneva
2134521 the sides agreed to contact each other in the next few days
2134522 theres more good television this summer than there has been in years past
2134523 i think network is going to take a page from the cablers and start developing scripted for summer as well
2134524 i dont think they will be able to get along over the next several years without going toe to toe with us in the summer
2134525 we thought get in the picture would do better than it did
2134526 the issue there is we havent been able to translate the disney channel show audience to the abc platform
2134527 this is the kind of movie i would run out to see
2134528 the kind of movies i watch are definitely guys movies this is departed this is fear this is all those characters times 10

2134537 for most black americans obamas candidacy represented a kind of racial milestone the natural next phase of a 50 year movement
2134538 but for michael nutter the reverse was also true not supporting obamas candidacy marked a kind of progress too
2134539 it demonstrates a continuation of this notion that the african american community unlike any other is completely monolithic that everyone in the african american community does the same thing in lockstep
2134540 our partnership with brussels airlines is particularly good for the clients of both airline companies as our route networks essentially are complementary as opposed to overlapping airbaltic has an excellent range of products in terms of flights to cis countries baltic countries and regional centres in scandinavia while brussels airlines offers attractive destinations in africa
2134541 the result is a strong performance in a highly challenging environment it marks the reward for the hard work that has been invested by all of the lufthanseats and all of the groups companies such as swiss it is the result of careful precautions
2134542 the undoubtedly very good first half result should not allow us to lose sight of the major challenges that lie ahead our company has the great opportunity to emerge relatively stronger from the increasingly difficult market and competition situation that we find ourselves in we have laid the foundations and will not jeopardize our future we have shown in the past that we are prepared for these kinds of situations and are capable of reacting to them our financial strength and operating adaptability will grant us the opportunity to remain profitable and strong and to continue to make our company more attractive for our shareholders customers and employees
2134543 no matter what the press may say about us im still proud to be in a sorority proud to be counted among our countrys very best
2134544 i think the people who work with bruce do not know him completely
2134545 cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like them
2134546 gavin buys into the stereotype that southerners must be hicks
2134547 hes not a hick because i say hes not and if you think he is you must be a bigot neener
2134548 disagreement shakes us out of or slumbers and forces us to see our own point of view through contrast with another person who does not share it
2134549 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2134550 i dont wanna go back to work i dont wanna see the credit card bill
2134551 i dont wanna go to the grocery store cook do laundry or clean house
2134552 we wanna go back to the garden island right now waaaahhhh
2134553 while rbs does face the threat of further writedowns and or a uk recession our view is that the company has taken a conservative stance on writedowns and has the benefit of diversification away from the uk
2134554 the first half of 2008 has been as difficult an operating environment as we have encountered for some time presenting both general and specific challenges to rbs
2134555 the results we have published today demonstrate progress in a number of important areas and it is all the more unsatisfactory therefore that they record a loss as a result of our credit market writedowns
2134556 i mean if the idea is to make a record that youd want to listen to yourself which never really happens but this is the record i would want to listen to
2134557 a comment our friend made after our last record influenced our approach to writing bits
2134558 he said you guys should try to write lyrics that are a little more universal as opposed to obtuse or abstract so ya know we decided its ok to write a love song it doesnt have to be veiled in all these layers of hidden meaning there are definitely a lot of love songs on the record hopefully theyre not falling into the clich of that idea
2134559 its fun to write about things that people dont necessarily write songs about but there is also a reason why people write about universal things like love theyre universal
2134560 the way we write songs is very democratic very collaborative
2134561 we go to our practice space and just jam and pick things we do it all together everything
2134562 theres a song on the record where a friend of ours wrote the lyrics and melody theres another song where a friend of ours is playing cello and its just adam singing
2134563 we wanted to have a larger volume of options and to try new things
2134564 people often say our music reminds them of growing up or college none of that is intentional at all it just so happens that were all fairly sentimental guys
2134565 in terms of mood if the last record was our summer record then this is our autumn record
2134566 the live show is an excuse for us to go nuts and have a good time
2134567 you know we come from punk rock and stuff like that its one of the main reasons we got into playing music because its so fun to go off onstage and just go nuts
2134568 its a long way to the top if you wanna rock n roll
2134569 if there was going to be another duet with dad i felt it should be something more whimsical fun and light
2134570 at the same time i was looking for a song that would also be familiar to a certain type of audience i think this is going to work just as well its adorable and loving between parent and child it feels like hes right there with me how do you top that
2134571 hey this sales method works when im selling inside my company too
2134572 it was great it was packed great vibe audience participation alcoholism paranoia laughs tears bullshit snot and bad jokes and that was just the front row
2134573 the first night of many more good times to come heres hoping
2134574 unexpectedly low ticket sales have left festival organisers with no option but to cancel the event
2134575 wed like to take this opportunity to thank all those people that have made the festival such a success in previous years
2134576 we d also like to whole heartedly apologise to the bands artists agents managers suppliers sponsors media supporters and festival goers that have been let down by our decision the decision to cancel has not been an easy one for the team behind the event
2134577 frankly too difficult for users to get their hands around
2134578 should you invest in bonds real estate precious metals collectibles cash
2134579 i think it is an important step that the gravity of the situation has been recognized and that there are some steps in place to turn the tide in afghanistan
2134580 whether that is successful or not is of course an open question
2134581 in terms of milestones its important to point out that no casualty is more significant than any other
2134582 each service member is equally precious and each loss of life is equally tragic
2134583 the reported presence in afghanistan of the head of al qaida in iraq underscores the extent to which blowback from iraq is being felt in afghanistan
2134584 at this point leadership seems to be looking at the afghan theater as the next big thing
2134585 he had a soul that is often missing in the business which has taken on much more of a corporate tone
2134586 where did i go right youre no one in hollywood unless someone wants you dead
2134587 we got a dead person a 250 a week raise i knew i was in the right business
2134588 you take care of everything and get them ready for the day
2134589 how do you take an actor or comedian or a writer and point them in the right direction and go through all that garbage unless you love it and love them and think theyre talented and worth it
2134590 i put about 20 films in development at lorimar and ended up making six lousy movies two good movies and one great movie
2134591 team santa clarita justifies the pride that we feel for our local youth by their going into this arduous competition and winning for the third year in a row nonetheless

2134593 based on our review we believe our investment in aol may be impaired
2134594 well run company with a superior reputation for quality and service has customers all over the world and in all types of businesses limiting impact from slowing us housing market
2134595 when a light turns green at an intersection for example and the car ahead of another driver has not moved there is some chance that a horn will be sounded
2134596 these honks follow observed patterns that may or may not fit your pre existing notions drivers in convertibles with their tops down less cloaked in anonymity were less likely to honk than other drivers for a similar reason drivers in new york city surrounded by millions of strangers are likely to honk more and sooner than a driver in a small town in idaho where a car that has not moved might not be a random nuisance but the stalled vehicle of a friend
2134597 during periods of slow economic growth the last thing an advertiser wants to cut is its spending on search based advertising
2134598 when someone is ready to take action by clicking on an ad or buying something they will go to a search engine and type in what theyre looking for
2134599 the very last ad is the one that gets 100 of the credit we did this case study to get a better understanding of the synergies between search and display
2134600 when people type in those keywords they are at an extreme point of sale thats well understood everyone knows google gets a whole heck of a lot more credit for searches than what is attributable
2134601 a premium class seat to europe used to cost between 90 000 and 250 000 miles and will now cost between 100 000 miles and 350 000 miles
2134602 an early draft of the regulation found its way into public circulation before it had reached my review
2134603 it contained words that lead some to conclude my intent is to deal with the subject of contraceptives somehow defining them as abortion not true
2134604 the department is still contemplating if it will issue a regulation or not
2134605 if it does it will be directly focused on the protection of practitioner conscience
2134606 this rule permits health care providers to refuse to perform any service they deem morally objectionable which raises critical questions about access to all health care services
2134607 under a sunny sky thousands of people began gathering along the route of the olympic torch relay to show their support for the torch run
2134608 i just decided to take some time study out here im a medical student
2134609 ill be looking for maximum to thank them all day

2134611 my husband was seen quickly with a testicular lump the chest x ray was sent electronically to the consultant admitted three days later for surgery
2134612 its a bit like working alongside a rather large elephant
2134613 youre never quite sure where its accidentally going to put its feet
2134614 calls on all parties immediately to cease hostilities and resume the negotiations the only way of finding a way out of the crisis
2134615 not inflame the situation by sending its forces to georgia
2134616 accept no excuses from any party that refuses to disengage
2134617 to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the republic of georgia
2134618 moscow can be part of the solution or part of the problem
2134619 i hope that the georgian side will reconsider its reckless actions in the area of the georgia south ossetia conflict
2134620 without the economics we dont have a risk management function in terms of our investment
2134621 were a brand new government initiative and we are working on our initial plan
2134622 my job is to help foster cooperation and information sharing between those three communities
2134623 we need to do a lot more work in that area
2134624 we may want to invest in protocols because it might be the best investment we can make
2134625 i dont work for a party i dont work for a president i dont work for a special interest
2134626 i dont work for myself i work for you and the country we love
2134627 yesterday he obama accused me of having president bushs policies on energy sen obama voted for that bushs bill and its big oil giveaways
2134628 i know he hasnt been in the senate that long but even in the real world voting for something means you support it and voting against something means you oppose it
2134629 the facts speak for themselves john mccain voted with george bush 95 percent of the time and has proposed 4 billion in additional tax giveaways to big oil
2134630 sen obama has a serious plan to end our dependence on foreign oil by investing in a range of alternative energies that will boost ohios economy and create good paying new jobs
2134631 i made a couple of mistakes and it cost me a few runs
2134632 you have to make the decision right away sometimes you make the right one and sometimes you make the wrong one
2134633 ive read somewhere that a couple who already has a child with autism has a 1 in 20 chance of having another child with autism
2134634 what was the average cost for a gallon of gas in 1988
2134635 you kind of get into bed with people who dont really view music the way you do
2134636 not everyone can be fugazi and have this socialist control over their art some of us have to flirt with the big guys in order to take all the cash to get our names out there once your name is established you can start doing your own thing and just borrow the parts of the system that you need like distributors i definitely come from the school that thought all that s was evil more and more i realize money isnt such a bad thing just another device to help you make stuff
2134637 do not stay on the same bus on the same train on the same plane in the same buildings or any place the chinese are
2134638 i think what theyre doing is theyre trying to capitalize on the buildup to the games
2134639 and the apparent opportunity tip believes the olympic games presents in terms of targeting and striking a blow to china that the threat is credible and should be taken seriously
2134640 is indicative of an orchestrated campaign designed to fulfill jihadists belief that they should provide warning before launching a significant attack
2134641 i think the actual olympics themselves the venues the guests the athletes are going to be safe
2134642 de cada peso que ingres al fisco en el primer semestre del a o hacienda tuvo que devolverle a los contribuyentes el equivalente a 63 centavos debido a los reg menes especiales y tratos diferenciados que tienen los impuestos federales

2134644 when the media reports on the capital market it is referred to as dalal street the name is synonymous with indian capital markets the street witnessed the growth of the indian capital market when you write the history of the countrys stock markets you cannot leave out the words dalal street dalal street is not a foreign name that needs to be changed it is an indian name

2134647 there can be no assurance that impairment charges will not be required in the future and any such amounts may be material
2134648 the u s economic downturn was tough on the newspaper industry in the second quarter
2134649 there are significant opportunities to consolidate editorial sales and administrative offices throughout the company this consolidation will enable us to sell certain properties
2134650 leaves for another day the question of how and to whom the award should be distributed
2134651 perhaps it is not too much to hope that the announcement in this memorandum of a hard number will give rise to some off line conversation between the parties in the meantime
2134652 plaintiffs demonstrated willingness to accept data they liked and reject data they disliked did not enhance the credibility of their model
2134653 we believe we presented a strong compelling case that individual indian trust beneficiaries are entitled to much more than the governments admitted mismanagement of our trust monies over the past 120 years
2134654 the department is gratified that the court recognized the complexities and uncertainties involved in this case
2134655 is a dinosaur the morally and culturally oblivious hand me down of a disgracefully racist and imperialist government that should have been buried a century ago
2134656 it is an opportunity for the companies to continue to put products on the market without a pre market evaluation by the fda
2134657 this is a provision that recognizes the reality that as the agency staffs up it wont be able to do every single thing from day 1
2134658 here was our concern lets say i launch a product today thats a straight up the gut traditional cigarette
2134659 the big fear was you go out there and the fda comes out with regulations and says oh thats not a registered product

2134667 politicians who choose to use profanity leave the impression that their vocabulary is lacking that they are incapable of choosing proper less vulgar words to express their emotions
2134668 im a fairly passionate person about certain things and the death of a child is tremendously difficult i said some pretty kind of rough things during the time of the sgt stephen liczbinski death as well
2134669 i wanted people to understand just how serious i was about this particular situation
2134670 la cafe na parece bloquear varios de los efectos perjudiciales del colesterol que causan filtraci n en la bhe
2134671 los altos niveles de colesterol son un factor de riesgo de la enfermedad de alzheimer quiz s porque compromete la naturaleza protectora de la barrera hematoencef lica

2134673 and they are not receiving the support they should from the department of licenses and inspection
2134674 theres a concern of what an influx of students is going to do in an otherwise quiet residential neighborhood
2134675 do any of you guys have beds that we can just temporarily remove or ones we can just make look like sofas tell them the landlord lives downstairs if they come to the door just say all five of you are cousins
2134676 temple cant provide housing but now the nearby streets cant either somethings got to give and students are soon going to find out if they havent already that neighborhood families are not giving up without a fight
2134677 i try to be a good neighbor and try to keep my property well maintained and cleaned
2134678 when you take that grass away the character of the community changes
2134679 by pouring concrete down where you used to have grass youll have more reflective heat from the sun the grass absorbs some rainfall and it creates a cooling effect for the neighborhood
2134680 then i went up to the 11th floor and filed a complaint
2134681 we cant get a straight answer out of l amp i
2134682 we are a serious country that organized totally successful olympics and we are not going to concern ourselves with something that borders on the absurd
2134683 this is not a new or unknown vulnerability of the first generation e passport
2134684 but it is na ve to think a clone passport wont get caught at the border crossing of a country using e passport technology
2134685 if the reference implementation is not that strict what about real world set ups
2134686 its kind of silly see what you think of it
2134687 i listened to it and he couldnt believe i really liked it he had dashed it off so quickly
2134688 he was an incredible song writer and a marvelous performer
2134689 he was like a rock star he was magnetic and charismatic on stage
2134690 he was on the cutting edge of what was about to happen
2134691 he was a great front man he could get the crowd going nuts
2134692 he was a complex man one of the most delightful people ive ever met but he was serious about what he was doing you had to get out of his way
2134693 poet within him coming out there were deeper stories within him
2134694 with deep penetrating eyes his impact on philadelphia music and the local rock scene was unparalleled he should not only have a star on the walk of fame but the city should build a statue for him
2134695 this contradicted the assumption that everyone has about what happens when you turn your computer off
2134696 with a click of the power button the information is supposed to dissipate but it doesnt when it comes to encryption this is a problem
2134697 most experts assume that a computers memory is erased almost immediately when it loses power or that whatever data remains is difficult to retrieve without specialized equipment
2134698 we show that these assumptions are incorrect ordinary dram chips typically lose their contents gradually over a period of seconds even at standard operating temperatures and even if the chips are removed from the motherboard and data will persist for minutes or even hours if the chips are kept at low temperatures
2134699 you know he must read the papers a lot because he said hello yogi
2134700 answering questions about that game is something ill always have to deal with
2134701 they won the seventh game but we lost on saturday night
2134702 all season long we won as a team and as soon as we lost some of the guys started pointing fingers
2134703 we had accomplished so much and had come from behind in such dramatic fashion in the playoffs that the sixth game just seemed like a good bounce that gave us the chance to win what we believed we should win
2134704 even though we knew we deserved it we know we won because of stanley s wild pitch and buckner s error
2134705 could throw every pitch in the book but he was economical if he saw that he could win a game with three kinds of pitches he would use only three jerome on the other hand had a tendency to run in the direction of experimentation murry dickson formerly of the pirates now of the phillies has a fine assortment of pitches but he feels an obligation to run through his entire repertory in every game
2134706 murry is the sort of pitcher who will go along splendidly until the eighth inning and then apparently say to himself oh dear me i have forgotten to throw my half speed ball and then and there he will throw it
2134707 i am weary of this diet it is a cruel and inhuman thing
2134708 there are times in a mans life when he wants above everything else in the world to have a potato
2134709 the subject of my retirement comes up from time to time
2134710 and to the direct question when will you retire from baseball my answer is never but i qualify that now i do foresee the day likely next year when i shall spend less time at my desk at my office i shall spend more time in the field scouting looking at prospects and leave the arduous responsibilities of the general managers position to other hands
2134711 my next thing a completely new idea in spring training
2134712 a permanent training camp designed and built for that purpose twin motels not hotels motels with four playing fields in between as a sort of quadrangle a public address system especially designed press accommodations now one motel would be occupied by the pittsburgh club the other by an american league club they would play a series of exhibition games and would draw better than two teams from the same league everything that went into the camp would be the result of our experience with training camps all through the years it would be foolproof and it would pay for itself because it would be operated for tourists after spring training i have the land at fort myers florida the finest training site in the country for my money i have an american league club ready to go along with me i have two thirds of the financial backing necessary
2134713 everybody concerned is ready to put up the cash now
2134714 is that i cant go along with the plan until we have a contending ball club but well get there well put over this thing it will revolutionize spring training
2134715 ive got a meeting at the office where can i drop you mother
2134716 go to that store i showed you mother i understand they have the largest selection of lamps in town
2134717 has given me a life of joy i would not have exchanged it for any other
2134718 i was panicked a bit because i really dont know about
2134719 he wanted them to all come and have a good time
2134720 everybody knew him and everybody liked him he really had his heart in this community and between him and previous mayor ed kemper englewood is what it is today
2134721 hey guys miss me im am so sorry sososososososososo sorry you have no idea i hated being away form you guys i just got really really busy unexppectly and didnt realize i didnt have any shoots for you im pretty sure my editor lost some cause i always like to keep some in reserve anyway about this shoot let me tell you if ever there was a shoot worth waiting 3 weeks for it is this one you look up the owrd twisted fantasy in the dictionary and theres a picture of this shoot right next to it heres a basic rundown of it imagine you just finished weorking out and youre in the lockerroom shower clensing yourself naked as the day you were born youre thinkning youre all alone when all of a sudden 4 beautiful girls come bursting in on you and theyre laughing and pokin at ya they make fun of you they have there way with you theycary you off into a nest they made for you full of soaps and lotions and they clean you and lube you and clean you and lube you one starts riding you you are theyre slave you dont know whether to cry or run or moan or laugh or smile but you cant move it is both the most frightening and most enjoyable thing that has ever happenbed to you so yeah thats pretty much this shoot enjoy
2134722 zgegtheme vert 3 0 does not appear to be a valid theme
2134723 hosting the olympic games has been a century old dream for the chinese nation said liu qi president of the beijing olympic organizing committee
2134724 one section required that over 600 performers should have uniform expression in their eyes so they must have exquisite feelings and they have to work very hard
2134725 its womens day tomorrow around the world so they wanted a woman
2134726 the national olympic committees were in agreement but the political powers were not
2134727 i dont think you can hang your hat on one night to win any job
2134728 i thought i played solid and made the right reads and ran the offense that has been my goal as long as i continue to do that ill be fine
2134729 for the amount of playing time i got i thought i did well i felt comfortable out there
2134730 just as there are people who want me to succeed there are a lot who dont want me to be here
2134731 i want to continue to show the people within the organization who want me to be here that i do belong i think did a little bit to help myself tonight
2134732 special feature interview with douglas giesel and an update interview with lewis schofield
2134733 we will do this as long as people want to come and see us
2134734 there will be some solo projects if time allows but right now the eagles come first
2134735 if you dont learn to read music then thats a whole tradition that becomes very exclusive and it shouldnt be
2134736 i used to write for small orchestras when i was 15 i sold my soul to the devil and became a pop star and forgot about it but in the past few years i have got back into orchestration
2134737 i think anyone interested in music should be forced to learn that discipline
2134738 it depends what you believe a secondary school musical education is for
2134739 i was like right this is the first time im going to let someone co produce but the guys s hes got no clue so i just took it home and re did it all protected some of my songs
2134740 its kind of like spinal tap and the office but not funny
2134741 well not as funny you dont know what youre watching whether its a movie a documentary and its just about me trying to set up a label what im willing to do to make it happen what artists are willing to do to get their music out just struggling
2134742 its something ive always wanted to do go on tour for the summer have a bus perform my own music and its really exciting for me
2134743 its going better than i expected there are more people showing up so thats great im going to towns where i wouldnt expect they would know of me and having really good turnouts
2134744 it was an album where i found that i was really searching for who i am at this point in time and what i want to contribute to the world what i want to change about myself
2134745 i was also recognizing where i am at this point in time
2134746 i was going through some personal stuff and i went into glens studio that day
2134747 we were supposed to write an upbeat song i guess i wasnt feeling in an upbeat mood i just was sitting at the piano and fumbling around and i came up with this chord progression he usually just sticks a microphone in your face to record everything thats going on thats what came out that day
2134748 the nicest thing about being out on tour is being able to meet a lot of the fans in person i find that the biggest gift ive received so far on tour is that people really talk to me about how brave has connected with them they have been telling me some really personal intimate stories about their lives i never imagined that a song would take on such a larger life than what i was experiencing these people are going through some really powerful stuff and the song has touched them and connected with them in a way i get to hear it from their mouth its a real gift for a songwriter
2134749 then we should have the rest of august together and then well be traveling again
2134750 were handling it pretty well we speak to each other every day and make sure that we really feel like the other person holds one in their hearts even when were away its very important to feel like you are being missed no matter how crazy your lives are
2134751 i grew up listening to country so the transition has felt comfortable for me
2134752 i think he saw me as a father figure and he confided in me he had some mind blowing tales about
2134753 the perception is its a childless white couple that adopts from overseas but thats not what i found
2134754 more women get custody of children in divorce cases so after a divorce the mom is living with her kids and she meets a man and they get married and he adopts her children
2134755 this is the very first national data weve had on mens lifetime adoption experiences
2134756 the luncheon targeting all area ladies will feature live and silent auction opportunities and in addition drawings favors and entertainment
2134757 entertainment will be a vintage style show and display of clothes from the 1940s and 1950s

2134999 there is nothing wrong with the united states that a dose of smaller and less intrusive government would not cure
2135000 the social responsibility of business is to increase its profits
2135001 corporations have a fiduciary responsibility to maximize profits even if it means betraying the nation trashing the environment or fomenting unconscionable levels of inequality nothing is unconscionable for a corporation because they dont have consciences theyre not really people whatever the courts may say
2135002 yes its horrible but what can i do about it if i insist on hiring american workers at american wages my firm will go broke or before that happens the board of directors will fire me im helpless
2135003 to secure these rights governments are established among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed

2135005 when you are in a hole the first thing to do is stop digging
2135006 the willingness with which our young people are likely to serve in any war no matter how justified shall be directly proportional to how they perceive the veterans of earlier wars were treated and appreciated by their nation
2135007 the bad news about the armys treatment of our wounded soldiers keeps coming the generals keep apologizing and insisting that things are getting better but they are not
2135008 we never leave a soldier behind on the battlefield or lost in a bureaucracy
2135009 a bully used to jump on my back when i was in junior high school one day when i just couldnt take it anymore i bent forward as he jumped
2135010 oh what a stupid joke let me press the thumb down
2135011 hes telling other kids to stay calm when hes acting like this
2135012 i couldnt get over the fact that there was no difference between sylvias restaurant and any other restaurant in new york city i mean it was exactly the same even though its run by blacks primarily black patronship
2135013 there wasnt one person in sylvias who was screaming m fer i want more iced tea
2135014 that way you have the whole day to work it off
2135015 if left untrreated celiac disease can damage your small intestine and keep you from absorbing nutrients
2135016 victorias secret want lean fit tight models and mirandas getting a lot of praise from the art director and everyone there because of her healthy body
2135017 one of my proudest moments was seeing recent photos of miranda and how strong her body looked she couldnt wait to walk the runway and show the world that being lean toned and fit is something you can be without having to be skinny and anorexic
2135018 there was no familiar face in music or sports that i could connect with but i started to see it as an opportunity to be an inspiration to a generation that doesnt openly talk about having diabetes and not feeling embarrassed by the disease
2135019 when i was on those crazy diets id gain weight because i would binge on the diet food i learned that any restriction on the kind of food i eat was going to be a problem
2135020 with demand on the states transportation system increasing the cost of doing business rising and revenues remaining relatively flat we cannot continue to do business as usual
2135021 the effort here is to reduce the layer of government bureaucracy to get people talking to each other and make sure we are doing things consistently and right to reduce the silo mentality were seeing within the department
2135022 we will adjust this organization to reflect the needs of the 21st century as we have been talking about for almost seven years
2135023 its been more or less business as usual and it was time to make a change to upgrade the department to make it more efficient and more effective
2135024 i think youre going to see a re energizing of the people who work for the dot
2135025 im optimistic to the steps dot is taking right now and hopefully theyre going to be serious about revamping revising and being more accountable to the citizens of north carolina
2135026 un ingreso econ mico pagado por el sector p blico a cada ciudadano y ciudadana de pleno derecho a n en el caso que no quiera trabajar de forma remunerada independiente de otras posibles fuentes de renta que pueda poseer y sin importar con quien conviva
2135027 the central asian uighurs know a great deal about the two east turkestan periods of sovereign rule and they reflect on that quite frequently
2135028 the ultimate end of socialism is the subsumation of the individual for the good of the state at that point all of us are numbers not individuals as stalin said the death of a million is merely a statistic
2135029 its not an accident of heredity or environmental conditions why i have tmj
2135030 hi apple im the it manager at insert global multinational company id like to buy 10 000 iphones please
2135031 apple is around 10 years behind all the other manufacturers so creating a phone fully featured is quite a feat
2135032 apple is quoted as being the best technology company of the decade it was the best marketing company of the decade
2135033 doesnt understand that this isnt the only class that i have to take this semester
2135034 we think the technologically sophisticated design of mccann systems new site will better serve our clients needs as well as engage them in the incredible world of audio visual technology
2135035 im going to a new school and im going to meet new people and thats why im a little nervous
2135036 now that its getting closer to school opening which is tuesday i know in the last 10 days before school it gets busier and busier
2135037 it could be chaos if we werent organized we take care of everybody we can but it is crazy
2135038 every year it gets busier and busier no matter what
2135039 i kind of feel cool about going back to school because i get to meet all my friends again and get back with everybody even get to see my teachers too
2135040 they are excited because i have one whos going in to be a freshman and i have one who is going to be an incoming sixth grader
2135041 but its been hectic weve been running around and getting school supplies and stuff
2135042 ill be lonely i guess because there is no noise at home just me no loud music no ipods or things
2135043 but itll be quiet and ive got a lot of cleaning to do
2135044 we are trying to develop a contingency plan for telephones trying to get cell phones for them because we need to have that
2135045 if it wasnt spent for the ordering of books would you please explain to me what that 12 million was spent on
2135046 we ask that question of ourselves every day is it more important for them being here or is it more important to be in the schools i have the utmost confidence in the superintendent dr nerissa bretania shafer that she has her front line soldiers to do what is necessary to open up the schools while she is here
2135047 the development moratorium was a fatal blow to numerous potential developers considering investing on guam
2135048 we look forward to a resolution of the moratorium issue as quickly as possible
2135049 guams commercial real estate sales volume periodically fluctuates and the global credit and liquidity squeeze means that last years record commercial sales volume of 76 8 million is unlikely to be surpassed in the near term
2135050 after three years of double digit percentage growth the median price of a guam single family dwelling stabilized during the first half of 2008
2135051 high priced residential property sales are especially weak due to the wide gap between seller and buyer expectations
2135052 so its not only my bikes out there but my kids bikes too
2135053 since our last price movement july 31 the market cost of shells fuel products have dramatically reduced
2135054 shell wishes to pass these savings on to our customers
2135055 we dont expect that a provider is going to know everything about every nationality
2135056 the critical thing here is developing sensitivity and the understanding that not every culture responds to medical providers in the same way sees medicine in the same way
2135057 from our peoples point of view were offending the doctors because theyre the experts as far as modern contemporary medicine
2135058 some doctors may think oh my goodness what happened to the babys butt
2135059 but the doctor understood thats just how asians are if the physician already knows about it if they are aware that certain races have certain characteristics then they dont have any doubts
2135060 none of the treatments studied had any significant benefit over no treatment at all
2135061 its not in the realm that you would expect it to be if these interventions were really performing
2135062 what was clear to me and clear to us is we had a huge opportunity to create content that were boys favorites
2135063 youre fighting the brand perception the very very strong brand equity thats been in the marketplace for many many years
2135064 it would almost require a completely separate effort to reach tween boys with a completely different name somehow associated with the disney property to reach these tween males
2135065 what we heard loud and clear is they expect from disney this broad array
2135066 they want a place essentially a headquarters for them where their favorite content exists that has this broad array of shapes and sizes and tenors and complexities and treats them with the respect that disney channel treats all kids and the girls are fanatical about
2135067 it isnt exactly a joyful time in america right now 4 gas people who cant afford vacations wild prices on food and so forth
2135068 theyre really looking for something to cheer for this american team these olympic athletes certainly offer that the television audience has really suffered of late from a paucity of great scripted drama theyre about to get 17 days and nights of unscripted drama
2135069 its once every four years at most for many of these competitors once in a lifetime
2135070 and many of the events go by in an eye blink so you think of the drama involved in preparing your entire life and then intensely for several years prior to this event and maybe youre in an event that lasts 10 seconds or less or lasts just a few minutes and it is this which will define you for your entire career i think that raises the stakes and raises the drama and its why so many people around the world americans included pay attention to events at the olympics
2135071 our primary aim is as the sole rights holder in the united states were the only way that you can see the major events of the games
2135072 so were not going to cavalierly blow out sporting events to show news but if its really news were going to cover it and in the major venues we have our own cameras so if something develops during the opening ceremony we have our own cameras and we also have both news and sports people ready to comment on that
2135073 this notion that america is more xenophobic than other nations i dont think is true if you actually analyze tv from country to country and i know for a fact since ive been involved which dates to 1988 that the proportion of focus on non american athletes has increased
2135074 are americans somewhat more interested in american performers of course they are but we dont insult the intelligence of the audience theyre interested in any good story wherever it may appear it isnt just that americans tend to place or will place competitors in all 34 of the sports but americans tend to excel in the sports that are of the greatest interest to americans and the ones that we tend to show the most in prime time if you were to watch olympics tv in pakistan you wouldnt believe how much badminton they would show you wouldnt believe if you came to china several olympics ago how much platform diving and table tennis you would have seen because thats what they excelled at
2135075 rich with information schedules listings news bios of the athletes
2135076 well essentially take every sport and offer it on demand well take the best of our television coverage every day and offer it as encores and of course well have a huge volume of highlights all of this at the fingertips of the olympic fan
2135077 in barcelona the spanish contingent had only a handful of events in which they could contend
2135078 as prideful as the greeks were about hosting the olympics and having it return to its birthplace in athens they had only a handful of moments to shine well the chinese were second to the americans on the gold medal chart in athens in 2004 theyve been building and building for this when liu xiang takes to the track in the 110 meter hurdles when yao ming leads the chinese team against the americans in their very first game in the second day of competition of the olympics this is going to be like a super bowl atmosphere and that is not an overstatement i think those of you who know me know that i try to stay away from hype and overstatement this will absolutely be mega big in china and that will add to the atmosphere and the feeling of anticipation and tension and excitement that surrounds these olympics
2135079 ive been managing the whole bmx squad for the last two seasons my role at the olympics is to make sure the team only has to worry about riding a bike everything else is laid on for them
2135080 she has got a really good chance of at gold shanaze is the current champion and odds on favourite shes quite a phenomenon

2135090 i am as amazed as anybody we had an overtime ban in place and as part of our negotiations we agreed to suspend it and lo and behold as soon as we suspend it people start working over time
2135091 during the transition period the company do not want to be left in a position where if they get an order they cannot fulfil it
2135092 static rules do not take into account all the environmental variables that affect signal degradation such as attenuation fading and interference
2135093 the communication range in a commercial building corridor is vastly different from that of a factory floor which is unlike a coal mine
2135094 sadly some erie county veterans end up dying without savings or strong family connections
2135095 despite their personal circumstances all veterans deserve the honor of a proper burial and memorial this new collaboration will ensure just that
2135096 unfortunately some veterans never receive the help they need and end up passing away without proper funeral and burial arrangements in place
2135097 we feel strongly that veterans deserve to be buried near their home
2135098 therefore mount calvary cemetery has developed a dedicated veterans cemetery at pine lawn cemetery specifically for cremated remains of indigent veterans as well as all veterans
2135099 veterans have given so much to this country and it is only appropriate and fitting that we all do our part to make sure every veteran is buried with the honor and dignity they deserve
2135100 there is growing support and demand for unmanned ground robots as people recognize the difference they make by offering life saving eyes on benefits to teams in the field
2135101 we believe that the low entry price point for irobot negotiator will help make it accessible to local state and federal agencies that would not have been able to afford a robot otherwise
2135102 sometimes the owners of the products dont like the message
2135103 security research often operates in a hostile environment and the law often gives companies ammunition to use against researchers
2135104 it is complicated and vague and there have been some bad decisions
2135105 but there are ramifications for saying no it has a negative impact on peoples security
2135106 some of the items that need to be enacted have a timeline
2135107 it is a major undertaking that will require a major investment of private capital
2135108 there is a real need to share information among the troops in a fast and efficient way
2135109 miniature objects that offer cool and dynamic content that can be placed on any page on the web theyre free and available for you to add to any webpage that you own
2135110 it is not clear to me that google gadgets have been adopted in a widespread fashion
2135111 i love being on the bleeding edge of whats coming next
2135112 google gadgets are designed with an open architecture so that anyone can produce them
2135113 the net result is that unless you look at a gadgets code you cant be sure what it is doing
2135114 i do pick up a lot more hours i pick up on call and davids been working more hours trying to pick up some more and doing some side jobs if he can
2135115 were not traveling as much we try to stick around the area well go out hiking instead and see what kind of new trails and waterfalls we can find instead of branching off to some of the different states to go on vacation
2135116 we need more places where families can go to spend some time and have fun that are more cost efficient society just needs to work together to bring the costs down
2135117 former countrywide kb home loans regional vice president mark zachary has said in court that kb home pressured its lending joint venture to engage in systematic mortgage fraud to drive sales including encouraging inflated appraisals assisting buyers in supplying false income information and approving loans without review or documentation

2135121 by sometime this summer half of the worlds population will live in cities for restoration movement churches in america this fact is problematic because our presence in cities is anemic
2135122 a reason our movement has struggled to embrace urban ministry is it doesnt fit neatly within our pre established paradigms of church growth while the suburban model has proven to be reproducible in many areas of the country there is no dominant urban model for success
2135123 we discovered at our meeting that virtually none of our contexts is similar
2135124 scott jewells ministry among the urban poor in inner city st louis is nothing like steve denneys ministry with city walk christian church in a gentrified area of san diego
2135125 the expansion of nuclear energy in the united states as a major component of our national energy policy
2135126 the whole reason we started down this path was the benefits written into the energy policy act of 2005
2135127 is a joint government industry cost shared effort that can help provide solutions to meet future base load energy demand and address climate change specifically np2010 seeks to demonstrate new untested processes for licensing reactors in the united states identify sites for new nuclear power plants complete first of a kind engineering of new reactor designs develop and bring to market advanced nuclear plant technologies and evaluate the business case for building new nuclear power plants
2135128 a monumental step toward the rebirth of nuclear power in the united states
2135129 selected nustart to demonstrate the nrcs untested process for licensing new reactors in the united states and for obtaining regulatory approval of new reactor designs
2135130 safe clean and reliable and for the foreseeable future it is the only mature emissions free technology that can supply the power america will need to meet the projected increase in demand for electricity over the next 25 years this is one of the reasons we have put so much emphasis on bringing about a nuclear renaissance here in the united states
2135131 there is a concern within this administration which i support that the imposition of a carbon cap in this country would may lead to the transfer of jobs and industry abroad to nations that do not have such a carbon cap
2135132 you would then have the us economy damaged on the one hand and the same emissions potentially even worse emissions
2135133 in over 50 years of operating experience the nuclear industry still has not managed to solve the problems of safety security and disposal of highly dangerous radioactive waste
2135134 until that happens were much better off investing in safer cleaner energy sources such as renewable wind geothermal tidal and solar projects
2135135 there is no need for me to write to you about this service
2135136 i will forget my complaint i will change my expression and smile
2135137 what is his name and the name of his son
2135138 they will greet you and offer you two loaves of bread which you will accept
2135139 we are hard pressed on every side but not crushed
2135140 the sound of weeping and crying will be heard no more
2135141 we get them in cycles and we certainly have been getting more calls this year than in the previous year
2135142 its not just a coincidence right now the salmonberry is finished weve had a bad spring the blackberries arent ripe yet
2135143 from what im hearing all of british columbia is seeing a peak this year in sightings and complaints
2135144 stephens said bears that wander into urban areas typically return to the wilderness on their own
2135145 theres no great benefit for them at all theyre confronted by dangers in traffic and that sort of thing theyre attracted by easy food
2135146 and the animals are more easily spooked when they find themselves in unfamiliar territory

2135150 bobo came to me because i played a lot on special teams i knew how the speed of the game works
2135151 i just want to help the team out linebacker is real similar to fullback any way all you got to do is run around and hit somebody
2135152 kind of christened himself picking up the blitz which was very nice
2135153 my dad taught me i can cook up a steak or bake a casserole if theres any single ladies out there give me a call
2135154 he said hell think about it i might have to slip him a little cash or something
2135155 if we get down real close and were winning he said hell audible a little pass to me so that way he can get a touchdown and i can get one too
2135156 i would love to get out there especially in the first two games when we have a lot of people out its the perfect opportunity to get some playing time
2135157 and how they play is affected by a their instincts b their ability to learn and execute their job and still play fast and use those instincts to be good tacklers and be able to play their responsibility on the defense were pleased with all three young linebackers that we have all three guys are learning and probably grinding a little bit right now but they all make plays and they all show flashes of having ability so were hoping that they can continue to develop so that they can play winning football and contribute to the depth of our team
2135158 theres a bunch of good athletes in the recruiting class
2135159 those kids have really come a long way theyre learning fast theyre handling the change real well its hard being a freshman coming in adapting to being away from home and being locked up for camp all day long those three guys have been pretty impressive so far
2135160 samuel who signed a six year 57 million contract during the offseason has been slowed by the injury throughout training camp since he was injured on july 28 during passing drills the eagles may also be without starting wide receiver reggie brown who has an inflamed achilles tendon coach andy reid said greg lewis would likely start if brown is unable to play

2135181 the valve has been steadily leaking a small amount above the stringent design specification from june 2006 until houston was placed in drydock in july 2008
2135182 less than the total amount of radioactivity contained in all of the smoke detectors installed in a typical family home
2135183 very small weepage past this valve above its tight specification
2135184 such an extremely small weepage rate is not expected to be identified by normal ship systems which would reliably detect larger leakage from the propulsion plant to protect the reactor plant the safety of the crew the safety of the public marine life and the environment

2135310 no hay mucha tradici n e inter s por los festejos taurinos
2135311 haci ndoles creer que les van a poner el toro embolao a la puerta de casa
2135312 existe una tradici n taurina desde hace m s de cuarenta a os
2135313 los toros los pagaban los clavarios hasta que hace veinte a os se prohibieron despu s de tener que pagar por el maltrato a una vaca
2135314 desde entonces nadie se animaba a organizar estos festejos por su elevado coste
2135315 no queremos molestar ocupar calles ni pedir un euro a nadie
2135316 s lo van contra los bous al carrer no les preocupa si se pasean cocodrilos o camellos en un desfile urbano o si un canario est encerrado en una jaula animales que sufren psicol gicamente como el toro en estos festejos
2135317 si se limitaran a denunciar el maltrato animal nos plantear amos si somos unos asesinos

2135336 during time trials were looking for everyone to run all out and then well put the closest grouping of cars together to race for the 16 car show
2135337 as a participant the coolest thing for them is this is their chance to be on tv to see themselves race under pressure like a john force or kenny bernstein
2135338 we create the competition and build the lifestyle reality show around the competition but this episode will be a lot about coming to denver racing at bandimere and the bandimere family
2135339 their starters outpitched our starters view slide show of nationals rockies series evaluate boxscores team leaders and more on rockies stats page ask troy e renck about the team or mlb in the rockies mailbag study previews probable pitchers lineups and in progress gamecasts for nl and al pore over pre game stats matchups boxscores and live scoring for nl and al post photos of you and your loved ones showing rockies spirit in this series and offensively they swung the bats better than we did
2135340 thats the reality of what it is we can talk all we want about what looks good on paper but you take it out there on the field and if you cant back it up out there you end up having a series like we just had
2135341 to lose three out of four to the nationals they played good but that is a team that we should have played better against weve dug ourselves a hole now we are going to have to dig ourselves out of it just like we have done all year
2135342 i never had any control and my fastball was wild
2135343 he was all over the place he had six walks and he pitched from mid thigh up into the zone he never got in a good rhythm or good sync with his command
2135344 we lost the first game today and the team needed to win the second game i didnt pitch good thats not a good feeling
2135345 one of my friends chad pennington he might not be too happy but as long as he winds up somewhere and gets his shot hell be good chad can play
2135346 were possessing the ball but the problem is teams are creating two chances and they score two goals
2135347 we put ourselves in view slide show of rapids playing vs tigres of the mexican league ask brian forbes about the rapids mls or the game in general in the soccer mailbag visit the rapids stats page for boxscores team leaders division standings and more great situations and then you must put the ball in the back of the net either you do or you dont we have the opportunities
2135348 maybe a chinese kid out there will learn from my story
2135349 im using running to get the word out about how horrible things were back in sudan
2135350 people are running out of darfur and i am putting myself in their shoes
2135351 i clearly expect the chinese to be the dominant team in the olympic games for many years to come
2135352 i wish there could be a rivalry like we used to have with the soviet union
2135353 to beat the soviets to beat the big bear was so exciting because everybody said grr were going to kill them it was gorgeous obviously nobody killed anybody but it was great competition
2135354 thats what i said before thursday that it would be a fresh start
2135355 it didnt go as well as i had hoped or as we had hoped
2135356 he was flowing to the glove and making good pitches early and his fastball command changed
2135357 you have to pitch more than four good innings i think we just need to let this play its way through before we start to try to figure out what we are seeing
2135358 everybody in here needs to do their job including me
2135359 it was annoying and difficult to be trying to fight a tough golf course and have an eye aggravating me at the same time
2135360 theres only one guy whos going to like this place by the end of the week
2135361 the course is 7 500 yards long the greens are firm and the pins are tucked away
2135362 they are sucking the fun out of the major championships when you set it up like that
2135363 i clearly expect the chinese to be the dominant team in the olympic games for many years to come
2135364 we are ready to face any team over age or under age
2135365 im not talking about political things because we are simply sports competitors im not a politician myself
2135366 a rivalry is good for sports without rivalries the people would lose interest
2135367 i wish it could be a rivalry like we used to have with the soviet union to beat the soviets to beat the big bear was so exciting because everybody said grr were going to kill them it was gorgeous
2135368 this is the first time that we have found a completely preserved chariot in bulgaria
2135369 therell have to be a full moon and some bizarre turnaround for this to become a political contest
2135370 this is one of those really rare moments in life and i felt such pride we had talked about this for so long we had planned and practiced and now we were walking into the olympic games
2135371 with the olympics about to begin the chinese officials have come to me and said no coach or player or manager can talk to the media
2135372 so this what im doing now is against their policy i asked them why we cant talk and they told me they didnt want to put a focus on their team and i told them you know that bothers me
2135373 we have players who deserve some attention we have a guy who played in the cba chinese baseball association quit the game and worked in the restaurant business for eight years now hes our best pitcher thats a story that should be told
2135374 i want to tell the stories about my players but they wont let me and thats a shame a real shame
2135375 the difference now is that theyve learned to play the game
2135376 i told them i didnt mind it that the balls were old but at least get the ones with the covers on you know it was like how far was that ball hit i dont know lets just follow the string the balls were awful
2135377 when we started my no 1 goal was to get them to have fun to enjoy themselves to enjoy the beauty of the game
2135378 when i first talked with them i said the first thing we do is put our caps back on the next thing i want you to do is look me right in the eye champions always look other champions in the eye
2135379 i wanted them to talk to me i wanted to pick their brains i wanted to find out what they were thinking about and when i told them that they just kind of stared at me nobodyd ever asked them to do that before
2135380 i think in this culture there is too much emphasis on the managers and coaches it should be about the players thats what ive tried to make it and you know what now we are having fun
2135381 i mean they really sang it and it gave me cold chills
2135382 somebody was telling me this field is the strongest in olympic baseball ever
2135383 there are no pansies no cupcakes no softies any more and i said oh yeah there is we are
2135384 but seriously we have a very daunting challenge our focus is on how we play the game and the players are starting to believe they can win that to me is really phenomenal thats what im most proud of
2135385 this lawsuit was more about politics than the law the court properly dismissed it
2135386 maybe i should start swinging it easy all the time because there were a lot of good shots out there i was just using my arms not using my body not trying to hit anything hard
2135387 thankfully i drove it really good so i didnt have too many shots out of the rough
2135388 my emotions werent exactly on the happy side so it was important that i made a birdie at the second hole and steadied the ship
2135389 every part of my game was really good apart from the first hole i hit some great shots through the closing holes
2135390 i got a hunch this is going to make youtube
2135391 this is dawn and she might have a crush on you
2135392 this is how it all comes to an end steve this is how it all comes to an end

2135394 ok lets go to stupid human tricks lets see you top this one
2135395 it is a fantastic opportunity for us to showcase our club and give back to the community through the luncheon
2135396 i won the metropolitan one last season and thats the main one
2135397 i ran second in the country last season so it was sort of good to win both of them this season
2135398 i come out of my time as an apprentice halfway through next season so its sort of my last full season as an apprentice
2135399 to finish the year and ride a good amount of winners is satisfying
2135400 theyre the races everyone wants to win it was a pretty amazing feeling
2135401 the conditions were much tougher than i expected this morning so i was happy that i was still able to go out and put together a decent score
2135402 the putter was the key to the round i putted pretty well yesterday but the greens were spiked up so i was excited about what i would be able to do in fresher conditions today
2135403 you never know you might shoot an 8 over and it comes down to sunday and you can still have a chance to win
2135404 the course is playing a lot harder today than yesterday
2135405 the winds a lot harder i know the guys playing in the afternoon its going to be very challenging for them
2135406 hes through the wall in multis with us hes on the threshold of greatness punters think he can do anything
2135407 only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california
2135408 a ffording same sex couples only a separate and differently named family relationship will as a realistic matter impose appreciable harm on same sex couples and their children because denying such couples access to the familiar and highly favored designation of marriage is likely to cast doubt on whether the official family relationship of same sex couples enjoys dignity equal to that of opposite sex couples

2135432 nothing is more painful to the human mind than after the feelings have been worked up by a quick succession of events the dead calmness of inaction and certainity which follows and deprives the soul both of hope and fear
2135433 georgia will not yield its territory or renounce its freedom
2135434 blood shed in south ossetia will weigh on their conscience
2135435 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located

2135437 ultimately financial matters are personal and we work to respect the privacy of the families
2135438 comes off as laid back and cool despite its pounding foundation which makes it sound like a more subdued version of a lost track from spoons
2135439 instead of complaining about the state of the education system as we correct the same mistakes year after year ive got a better idea
2135440 university teachers should simply accept as variant spelling those words our students most commonly misspell
2135441 we spell the word february the way we do only because it is taken from the latin word februa the roman festival of purification
2135442 similarly the correct spelling of the word wednesday comes from the old english wodnes daeg or wodens day but why should we still pay homage today to a pagan god or a roman festival of purification
2135443 there are enormous advantages in having a coherent system of spelling
2135444 it makes it easier to communicate maybe during a learning phase there is some scope for error but i would hope that by the time people get to university they have learnt to spell

2135459 its crazy how the dynamics have changed just in the last couple years
2135460 when i came in this team was fairly old we had those solid leaders al wilson john lynch rod smith the list went on and on those guys arent here anymore i dont know how many locker rooms are as young as ours but youve got to figure were in the top five in the league its a challenge its kind of fun we get to grow and come up together for one common goal
2135461 its the youngest team weve had since ive been here
2135462 youve got to have youth with the salary cap you dont have any choice
2135463 its kind of intimidating but also exciting to have your first nfl game playing a position you havent played since high school
2135464 this long preseason you get tired of beating your own guys up during camp you look forward to some fresh meat
2135465 the first group of performers are from professional artistic organizations from all over the country the second group of people are students and the third group are artistic performers from the peoples liberation army
2135466 to a certain degree i dont know what im getting into
2135467 im here for one reason not to do commercials broadway all those things
2135468 im a little out of shape compared to the other guys
2135469 the last 24 hours have been crazy this offseason has been bizarre but im excited by this opportunity
2135470 i think all the chinese spectators will try to support the chinese team i can imagine the enthusiasm of the chinese fans
2135471 the three way vying for the medal count i think will raise the level of interest in the olympic games
2135472 when you have somebody whos supposed to win all the time how exciting is that
2135473 the fact that it will be at home the fact that you have 1 3 billion people on your shoulder youre carrying their hopes of olympic success its mind boggling to think what these young people are going to be put through
2135474 we have a good team we have a strong team
2135475 i ate more pasta and protein as opposed to pizza
2135476 and my grandma hates the fact that i ever put on weight
2135477 and being stronger will help him physically because youre going to take some shots back there i also think it always helps your self esteem a little bit
2135478 id be afraid that a hed beat me and id get humiliated or b id hurt him and then id be an idiot
2135479 im not pressuring him to get us to the next level
2135480 it wasnt the hit or anything i was just trying to brace myself and my arm buckled
2135481 thats huge for coach to say that means a lot to me
2135482 that will help drive me to get healthy again and get right back into the competition
2135483 i ate more pasta and protein as opposed to pizza
2135484 my mom is the only one who talks about how muscular i am
2135485 and my grandma hates the fact that i ever put on weight
2135486 and being stronger will help him physically because youre going to take some shots back there i also think it always helps your self esteem a little bit

2135490 hes a tremendous loss to this team im ready to step in because that was my job as an alternate its a tough position to be in but dave and i worked really hard we pushed each other because we have to stay in shape ill definitely be ready on time its just an honor to be on this team and to be chosen
2135491 this has been an extremely hard decision for me to make
2135492 ive given everything i can to be ready to compete at this olympic games i put my heart and soul into gymnastics to get here and be unable to perform because of an injury is extremely disappointing but im a team player and im here to do whatever i can for this team
2135493 the process of me stepping aside is really a team decision
2135494 its everyone collectively going through this putting up their gymnastics and seeing whos good enough to
2135495 im just going to do everything im supposed to whether its off the field or on the field and get past this
2135496 hes got to show people in the community that this isnt talk
2135497 this is something hes going to prove not only to denver but the country that hes not only a great football player but a quality person
2135498 he does stuff on the football field that not many people can do
2135499 were going to have to make do we dont have any choice with it thats the decision so were going to have to move on and make it happen without him
2135500 but its out of our control and now we have to deal with it we just have to hold it down until he gets back its clear cut that hes our guy
2135501 its just being more responsible and its just being the best player i can be in the community and on the field
2135502 its not hard its not rocket science i have a job to do and i plan on getting it done

2135504 were not concerned about that if players actually stay in europe because they can earn more thats fine we think that european basketball which we try to support might be the better for it and thats good
2135505 this has been an extremely hard decision for me to make
2135506 ive given everything i can to be ready to compete at this olympic games i put my heart and soul into gymnastics to get here and be unable to perform because of an injury is extremely disappointing but im a team player and im here to do whatever i can for this team
2135507 the process of me stepping aside is really a team decision
2135508 its everyone collectively going through this putting up their gymnastics and seeing whos good enough to compete i wasnt able to do that these guys can go out there and get a medal compete with anybody else in the world i really believe theyre going to show the heart of america here in beijing
2135509 were going to have to make do we dont have any choice
2135510 all i can worry about is the future and getting better on the field and in the community
2135511 were not anybodys state department were not trying to change the world
2135512 boycotts just hurt athletes we had stupidly in our country started that mess
2135513 when china decided they were coming and surprised the world romania followed the former yugoslavia followed game over the boycott would not work
2135514 at that time no one wanted the olympic movement including los angeles lets remember we voted 80 percent or something to not spend a penny on the olympic games which was tantamount to giving the games away
2135515 we think its between this government and him hes a private citizen
2135516 it probably wasnt the best time to wear those masks
2135517 those athletes regret their action and have written an apology we believe itll be the last incident of this kind
2135518 were not chastising anybody but you never want to go to someones place and cause any embarrassment
2135519 we accepted an invitation we studied it and worked with the people in this country
2135520 theres nothing else in the world where people can come together like this if we can work more toward world peace itll be somehow wrapped in the olympic flag
2135521 the denial of my visa is part of a systemic effort by the chinese government to coerce and threaten athletes who are speaking out on behalf of the innocent people of darfur
2135522 but i remain convinced of the great role the olympics can play as a force for promoting world peace
2135523 im afraid if they throw him a swing pass hell call a fair catch
2135524 two days after we left our house was gone that was tough
2135525 there was a fire four years before that came within a third of a mile so we thought we might be ok then it was gone
2135526 were renting right now and im not sure well build another house there
2135527 i think it has helped me learn to deal with stuff
2135528 its very tough on anybody when youre young and you deal with adversity it forces you to grow up maybe a little sooner than youd like to
2135529 it was a broken play and i got tangled up
2135530 im going to get stronger and get back as soon as i can
2135531 this is as tough of a setup as ive ever seen
2135532 the usual setup for the pga is more like a tough u s tour event
2135533 its nearly more u s open type that the u s open is at the moment if that makes any sense
2135534 with we brits we dont hold any grudges us brits we get on with life
2135535 it was what the team needed it helped us put our best lineup out there
2135536 i think anyone else in here would have done the same thing its not about the individual
2135537 we have a lot of guys in here who are team players and garrett obviously has shown that he hasnt said anything about it
2135538 speaking for myself i know i am real comfortable with him over there he played it in the minor leagues i think hes doing a great job
2135539 i get in a hurry to get to the bag and give a good target
2135540 but first is my position thats the way i have to look at it until todd goes out on a rehab assignment and gets close to coming back
2135541 obviously you dont like slumps ever its just a timing issue i am not seeing the ball well
2135542 the season isnt much longer so i hope to get into a hot streak and ride it out the rest of the year
2135543 its the no 1 goal on the list just to make sure i get the job done
2135544 our slogan is finish it weve had our chance the last few years just couldnt get it done
2135545 hes just got a pure putting stroke one i try to emulate myself
2135546 hes got a soft touch around the greens and can get up and down from 10 12 feet as good as anybody
2135547 we have a lot of guys that are very good players
2135548 we have an advantage in that we are deeper than a lot of the other 3a teams

2135551 information i have is that he was identified by an attendant at a market in bridal falls and then arrested on highway 1 just west of hope
2135552 its a breach of their contract with the citizens of coquitlam and its putting not only the citizens at incredible inconvenience but its putting our citizens at risk and its putting bears at risk and thats unconscionable
2135553 theres not a day goes by that i dont get a whole bunch of calls about the poor garbage pickup
2135554 weve moved into july and august and with the warm weather over the last period everything is hatching and breeding out
2135555 if this is sustained we can expect wasps ants moths and all of these summer pests that we see more prolific now to be way more so possibly into september and october
2135556 i understand that they were on the same living unit and they do resemble each other
2135557 now inmates carry identification and that identification should stay with them somehow we believe these inmates were able to switch their identification exactly how they did that well have to wait until the investigation and see
2135558 there were no warning signs no tape no cones nothing to suggest a hazard
2135559 not a gaping hole but certainly uneven it was being repaved and the work crews hadnt put down the final layer yet

2135561 foreseeable risks of harm from unusual danger of which the city knew or ought to have known
2135562 two of them werent damaged too badly so we decided wed just let it go and let people judge for themselves how it could have been and one of them was damaged fairly badly but it was second place winner and we didnt want to take it down
2135563 its very disheartening when you decided you want to do something for the community and somebody else comes in and decides they dont want to see it done
2135564 unfortunately each one of the sculptures costs us at least 15 000 and they damaged nine of them
2135565 until more information comes in were treating this as a random act of vandalism
2135566 investigators in our richmond office are currently gathering information to assess the occurrence and what our response is going to be
2135567 weve been in contact with the b c coroners office and have undertaken to support the coroner in their activity
2135568 what were finding is that human beings are probably driven tremendously by comparison unless you understand those comparisons youre not going to understand the rate of obesity
2135569 understanding the sociology of obesity is much more important than understanding the biology
2135570 they may not be aware of it our computers can trace out these patterns without the individual necessarily knowing them
2135571 getting more and more pressure from dollar strength and it doesnt seem reversible for now
2135572 we knew then this was going to be a recovery operation not a rescue

2135574 russian armoured vehicles have entered the northern suburbs of tskhinvali
2135575 they have been calling it training exercises but they have not been concealing the fact that they are training these troops for use inside georgia
2135576 the way the escalation went was we came first under extensive artillery barrage from the separatists but in the end i was told that russian armoured vehicles started to cross the georgian border and that was exactly the moment when i had to take this decision to fire back
2135577 he is in big danger of losing the cachet he built up for himself in being pro western and the restraint he has often shown in the face of provocation by russia
2135578 if he is going to start a war he is going to lose the support of a lot of friends in the west
2135579 we are receiving reports that a policy of ethnic cleansing was being conducted in villages in south ossetia the number of refugees is climbing the panic is growing people are trying to save their lives
2135580 there is a rise in violence with weapons due to the gang related warfare thats out there

2135583 no place in negotiations between employers and employees about their wages and conditions
2135584 offensive and bullying behaviour towards employees is against the law and unacceptable
2135585 employers need to mind their ps and qs when dealing with staff
2135586 as for you asking for your f ing payslips were not going anywhere so you dont have to keep f ing asking for them
2135587 if it was up to me i would close the shop for a week sack everyone and rehire people who do care about my business
2135588 this was bullying conduct against an employee who plainly felt it to be offensive and oppressive because she resigned almost immediately thereafter

2135592 from 2005 til today weve had 14 babies born with syphilis which is a totally preventable condition

2135594 weve seen an increase specifically in infectious syphilis from 1997 to 2006 in the order of about 1 000 per cent going from 115 cases up to about 1 200
2135595 the data in this report suggest that progress in hiv testing stalled in the mid to late 1990s and new strategies such as expanded screening in health care settings appear to be warranted
2135596 what weve seen is that in a number of countries theyve already reached their universal access targets others have not

2135603 last year it became evident when we looked at the figures that the increase was not normal it started by the end of summer 2007 and when we looked at the figures we see that it was increasing mostly on the hudson coast
2135604 at the top of the curve we had i think close to 30 cases in one month this winter

2135627 remember the sabbath day by keeping it holy six days you shall labor and do all your work but the seventh day is a sabbath to the lord your god on it you shall not do any work neither you nor your son or daughter nor your manservant or maidservant nor your animals nor the alien within your gates for in six days the lord made the heavens and the earth the sea and all that is in them but he rested on the seventh day therefore the lord blessed the sabbath day and made it holy
2135628 look why are they doing what is unlawful on the sabbath
2135629 have you never read what david did when he and his companions were hungry and in need 26in the days of abiathar the high priest he entered the house of god and ate the consecrated bread which is lawful only for priests to eat and he also gave some to his companions

2135727 the firework performance was so wonderful it reminded people that it is the chinese who invented powder
2135728 it is impossible to miss the historic coincidence of the games happening on the 30th anniversary of reform and opening which has permanently transformed china
2135729 after 30 years of opening up china not only could host the olympics but also host a very good one

2135753 while other states take action against shady subprime mortgage lenders texas attorney general greg abbott does nothing texas has a deceptive practices act yet the statute has not been enforced against home lending giants like countrywide the actions in illinois and california show that abbott has the authority to do much more than sit by and watch as thousands of texans lose their homes each month

2135764 you can take a game 7 and times it by seven its gonna be something that nobodys experienced before i dont know if anybodys had a president come to a game to watch them play before
2135765 if you can just imagine and try to wrap your minds around the opening tip with dwight howard and yao ming as soon as that ball goes up every camera in the building is gonna be flashing
2135766 people are saying this is supposed to be the most watched event in basketball history for us to be a part of that for our kids our grandkids is something that will be something to look back on when were older honestly thats amazing
2135767 just thinking about this first game now you get goosebumps
2135768 its something well be able to tell our kids and our grandkids that we took part in the largest sporting event ever and you know theres been a lot of sporting events
2135769 it is a situation where ambulances cannot move hospitals are reported to be overflowing surgeries are taking place in corridors people are hiding out in their basements
2135770 there is no electricity no communications no access to basic supplies so it is a worrying situation and we also in addition call on all sides to respect international humanitarian law and to not target civilians to ensure that medical transport and medical facilities can treat wounded as necessary
2135771 this morning a unhcr staff member there reported that many buildings and houses have been destroyed and that only military personnel are moving on the streets water is also in short supply that is a chronic problem and it is being worsened by recent events most transport has stopped and shops are running out of food

2135780 im thrilled to be one of the only stores to carry this middle east e gaming development book release
2135781 well be hiring more workers within the next 6 months why because while some jobs will be made redundant in the new profit model we can take the talents of these valuable employees and parlay them into other equally paying jobs within our corporate structure
2135782 on more than just one level as a reporter its a great story and as a citizen of laborde brague borough i know that my neighbors will still have their jobs one has to realize that this will only strengthen the local economy and drive new business to our area these factors are key to economic survival and to my fellow citizens as we move forward in the next few years
2135783 we chose to use perl in our middle east e gaming development text studies because it is a lingual programming language
2135784 and also because it is easy to combine with other programming languages perl is easily installed on linux platforms and modules can be compiled that allow us to communicate with database technologies
2135785 with increased profits well be able to hire more employees and really grow our business
2135786 mostly because well need time to train these employees to be as effective middle east e gaming development producers as possible
2135787 were excited to learn that over 1000 new jobs will be created
2135788 the mall traffic is ok but not very high quality now with over 1000 new people visiting each day business will surely skyrocket
2135789 id like to personally thank lillard lear and aksamit lammert for the work theyve done on this project
2135790 without their efforts our company would need be able to meet the demands of the burgeoning consumer market when demand increases the only way to provide for this change is an increase in technology most importantly we wont be laying anyone off all current employees in our chanel takemoto county plant and all middle east e gaming development project employees will be guaranteed employment for 3 years
2135791 the firearm used by matuldi belonged to his father the motive for the killing has not yet been established
2135792 the man was forced into the car at gunpoint and the woman escaped unhurt the mans body was found with a bullet wound to the head

2135794 gevs wishing on a star that courtneys bf will dump her over this
2135795 a rivalry as legendary as ali versus frasier lakers versus celtics paris versus nicole is about to explode in an all out popping war
2135796 we smoked her but she was hosting the show so
2135797 this show is like a prestigious museum of immaculate paintings on the dance floor
2135798 homage to all the rabbits who died in the hands of incompetent magicians
2135799 the dedication of the dramatization of the creation of the preservation of the buckbuckbuck
2135800 we will make decisions regarding that open position as we assess our options in collaboration with the other united ways which serve niagara county and the tonawandas
2135801 be kind for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle
2135802 kindness has converted more sinners than zeal eloquence or learning
2135803 whatever was afoot he did not know what anybody elses plans were or might have been
2135804 he was saying from his heart that he didnt know of any plans to attack canada he said that repeatedly he said that sincerely and he said that quite credibly
2135805 maywand is to our knowledge an insurgent logistical node where things like bombs get made and moved to other districts
2135806 so we certainly anticipate that seizing bomb making supplies in maywand will have an effect of what will show up in zahri in the future
2135807 convincing the people of afghanistan there is a legitimate and viable option in supporting the government
2135808 and based on finds and some of the site exploitation going on any insurgents in the area that did manage to get out had to do so in a hurry because they left exploitable material behind
2135809 a large find of ied components homemade explosives a large quantity of that was found and destroyed in place
2135810 we know this area of maywand district is a feeder for other areas
2135811 we knew that if we could get in there for a prolonged period we would be able to cause disruption that would ripple through and assist in other areas aside from just localized effect in band e timor
2135812 this pushed georgia into a philosophy of self reliance the idea that georgia will be able to regain breakaway entities only by its own means
2135813 the elephant in the room behind this whole story is georgias nato prospects
2135814 it might be a signal to the russians saying that the sochi olympics will not go the way russia wants if there is no progress on the settlement in abkhazia
2135815 sta es una noche muy especial y quiero que sea muy loca pero antes de empezar con las locuras

2135821 welch ein optimist vielleicht w rde uns unser leben viel leichter fallen wenn wir es auch mit einer solchen gelassenheit nehmen w rden wie der videospiel sisyphos mit dem kugelbauch
2135822 you should know that milks sic nine essential nutrients make for one irresistible body
2135823 we basically filed a brief that says if you injure someone in houston texas you should properly be held accountable in houston
2135824 mcnamee slandered roger in houston and thats where the injury occurred
2135825 theyre trying to get a federal judge in houston to say that proper jurisdiction for suing mcnamee is in new york
2135826 its sort of the legal equivalent of dont mess with texas
2135827 hes spending most of his time following kobys career and following his kids
2135828 we have prepared for seven years together with bocog beijing organizing committee for the olympic games
2135829 i feel like the athlete who knows he or she has done everything that was needed and what was possible before the competition and then the competition has begun so you long for the competition that is the state of mind where we are
2135830 china will be opening olympism to one fifth of mankind one billion three hundred million people
2135831 that is a unique feature that only china can offer
2135832 our sacred duty is to reduce doping to the lowest possible level
2135833 we have an obligation to put in place all the means we have but we can not be hoping to have a zero doping situation
2135834 the conditions were much tougher than i expected this morning so i was happy that i was still able to go out and put together a decent score
2135835 the putter was the key to the round i putted pretty well yesterday but the greens were spiked up so i was excited about what i would be able to do in fresher conditions today
2135836 you never know you might shoot an 8 over and it comes down to sunday and you can still have a chance to win
2135837 the course is playing a lot harder today than yesterday
2135838 the winds a lot harder i know the guys playing in the afternoon its going to be very challenging for them
2135839 he made our team and he was playing a little bit early for the team it kind of got to a situation where he didnt suit up some i know he got upset which you should if youre a player that should bother you
2135840 he was not a big part of what we were doing late in the season a lot of guys can go south in those type of situations but what he did was rededicate himself get his mind right and hes had an excellent camp
2135841 anytime i dont get a chance to play its upsetting to me because i want to play as much as possible and help my team win
2135842 i remember those types of things and hopefully it wont happen again
2135843 knowing the situation i was coming into and the talk of the secondary needing to be better i just had to come in and just be well prepared and thats what ive tried to do
2135844 he has come back a real pro and ready to go
2135845 hes earning his way on this football team right now
2135846 hes just making plays fletcher knows what hes doing hes a real pro but hes making more plays on the ball
2135847 well theres this arthritis if i didnt have it id sure still be working
2135848 but im doing the therapy exercises the nurse showed me and they help a lot
2135849 the economic crisis is a fundamentally destabilising factor in a country that already has massive political problems
2135850 the incompetence and failure of musharrafs policies has thrown the country into the worst power shortage in its history his policies have weakened the federation and eroded the trust of the nation in national institutions
2135851 it gives the coaches a chance to talk about their kids
2135852 its a neat way to maybe hype up the season a little bit
2135853 bring some recognition to the conference and the players in the conference you see it a lot with the colleges and it always seems to get a lot of media attention it will be very interesting to see how it works out
2135854 the goal for many high school athletes is to play at the collegiate level and as an athletic administrator it should be our obligation to promote our athletes and get them as much exposure as possible
2135855 and think about the kids who might not be selected to the team before the season starts that gets him going and that helps maybe serve as motivation to the teams and the players if your team isnt picked as high as you deserve to be picked a coach can use that as motivation on the practice field
2135856 i think its a great way to show off the conference getting the coaches all together and getting them to talk about it
2135857 it will get the kids excited i think any time you can model yourself after what the collegians do that will just get more people talking about football and thats good attention for these teams and these kids
2135858 i dont know much at all about this conference right now
2135859 i tried to let price know that i would do my best to see what i could do but in the first year in a new conference when you havent been playing the teams doing something like this is tough even though i think it is an excellent idea overall
2135860 at this point i dont know who my own best players are going to be
2135861 if this is not a preseason nightmare for a coach i dont know what is
2135862 i just worry that if you leave someone off who should be on or at the end of the year whoever is on it people will say they should have been on it at the beginning of the year
2135863 cherpak wont want to hear this but i think theyre even better than when they won it last year theyre just loaded
2135864 i was kind of kidding around with the other coaches saying i dont know why were even worrying about having a preseason poll
2135865 tj will be no 1 and after that point why do you have to worry about nos 2 3 and 4 we know whos no 1 and we know what team will have most of the preseason all star team
2135866 its hard to tell but thats what makes it fun well see what happens
2135867 equipped to be around the sights and sounds of people
2135868 why is look out different because it removes the hype and gives a pragmatic view of the art of the possible
2135869 we wont use buzzwords and to prove it heres a naff buzzphrase

2135871 the rate of economic growth has exceeded our original expectations of between 3 5 and 3 7 percent and will reach some four percent by the close of year
2135872 we are examining to what extent this legislative measure would be useful at least for certain areas
2135873 in areas where there are one or two gasoline stations selling at the same price you can impose a ceiling but where there is a bigger price choice the measure can distort the market
2135874 admittedly during the olympics we are avoiding beijing due to assumed overcrowding
2135875 we only had two or three people who went although i had a number of people who inquired
2135876 with opening ceremony tickets going for as much as 7 000 its expensive and people are just not going
2135877 fewer business travelers which represents largely those who travel on united are going to china during the olympics
2135878 travelers to asia visit many countries on one trip given the long distance
2135879 because little business is occurring in china the next few weeks it has a spillover effect to other asia destinations as passengers delays trips until its back to business as usual in china
2135880 most of the large carriers basic fundamental strategies were to expand internationally
2135881 but they will find a weakness as a result of the economic slowdown
2135882 busy agents will truly love the ease and convenience of the trigger cards feature

2135888 with the current market situation do you still think whispering ranch is a good investment
2135889 so it was nice to get that big inning and lift a huge weight off our shoulders
2135890 emergency responders anywhere anytime can communicate as needed on demand and as authorized at all levels of government across all disciplines
2135891 dhs recognizes that the emergency response community will over time realize this national vision in stages as agencies invest in new communications systems and as new technologies emerge
2135892 more than 50 000 independent agencies across the nation routinely use emergency communications and each of these agencies is governed by the laws of its respective jurisdiction or area of responsibility no single entity is or can be in charge of the nations entire emergency communications infrastructure in such an environment collaborative planning among all levels of government is critical for ensuring effective and fully coordinated preparedness and response formal governance structures and leadership are needed to manage these complex systems of people organizations and technologies
2135893 we have newcomers we need to explain every detail to and we need to do some of that stuff so in a day or two we can have a football practice
2135894 but make no mistake about it wednesday was not a football practice
2135895 were going to thin those lines out weve got to get it down to about two guys getting most of those reps behind dally
2135896 one of those young guys might get some turns this season in the secondary
2135897 weve got all the right guys in the right spots
2135898 as far as the shuffled line well be fine itll bring the best out of everybody
2135899 we have a chance to play that kind of defense weve been accustomed to here
2135900 its hard to function when you dont have an important part of your team like that
2135901 hes one of the best athletes on the team and his force and quickness is going to help everyone
2135902 is that danielle no that doesnt seem right jolen no not her mary that girl i have a crush on from the 3rd floor ester yes i think ester
2135903 es una decisi n del entrenador y nosotros lo nico que hacemos es salir a entrenar haya gente o no haya prensa o no
2135904 oh sorry we destroyed your city and killed all those people in such a gruesome way when we really didnt have to hey could you pass me that stapler
2135905 the atomic bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki was a criminal act on an epic scale
2135906 the most enduring lie is that the atomic bomb was dropped to end the war in the pacific and save lives
2135907 air supremacy over japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
2135908 the national archives in washington contain us government documents that chart japanese peace overtures as early as 1943
2135909 no effort was made and none was seriously considered to achieve surrender merely in order not to have to use the bomb
2135910 to browbeat the russians with the bomb held rather ostentatiously on our hip
2135911 there was never any illusion on my part that russia was our enemy and that the project was conducted on that basis
2135912 in the new york times on july 18 the israeli historian benny morris once considered a liberal and now a consultant to his countrys political and military establishment threatened
2135913 the question begs are the rest of us to be mere bystanders claiming as good germans did that
2135914 a self righteous one way legal moral screen with positive images of western values and innocence portrayed as threatened validating a campaign of unrestricted violence
2135915 its helping us meet the increasing need for our lab services
2135916 in addition to our clinical work for geisinger we also conduct specialty microbiology testing for regional clients
2135917 so we have an incredible amount of specimens that are handled in our lab
2135918 this is a breakthrough in microbiology a field that hasnt benefited from the types of automation that are common in other labs
2135919 with this advanced technology the wasp complements the outstanding work of our lab technicians
2135920 but the real signal came out with some of the northerly species that are more common in canada and the northern part of the u s their southern range boundaries are actually moving northward as well at a much faster clip
2135921 there are a wide spectrum of changes that are occurring and those changes are occurring in a relatively short amount of time were not talking centuries were talking decades
2135922 new york citizens need to recognize that these changes are occurring
2135923 whether they are good or bad whether they should be addressed whether we should adapt to them whether we should try to mitigate some of this those are questions that really rightfully belong in the political arena
2135924 what you begin to see is a systematic pattern of these species moving northward as we would predict with regional warming
2135925 the closer together the hairs the more pressure the bubble can withstand before collapsing
2135926 we were surprised by the fact that in some cases bugs may be unable to survive in shallow water but we did discover they can safely dive as deep as 30 metres
2135927 however you gain weight because muscle weighs more than fat
2135928 we are best at discriminating the facial features that are typical of our neighbors and if they happen to be parrots we become very good at recognizing individual birds
2135929 ultimately we are interested in what happens in a natural environment
2135930 but some questions require more control over the properties of visual stimuli than a picture of a natural scene would allow
2135931 the response of individual neurons can be strongly influenced by simple stimuli in the surround of the receptive field a phenomenon known as contextual modulation
2135932 context is an important part of how we perceive visual stimuli
2135933 and these results show how individual neurons might adjust their properties in different natural environments such as on a beach or in a forest
2135934 the world has given its love and trust to china and today china will give the world a big warm hug
2135935 the attention ive gotten since ive been here has been overwhelming the bottom line as we all know is to win games thats what im here to do
2135936 i cannot tell you where the tree is going to be for obvious reasons because itll be stripped bare in about 30 seconds
2135937 if you had picked a number higher you wouldve gotten more money on your metrocard
2135938 let me warn you that when you get on and off the train during rush hours just be sure to follow your blockers
2135939 you win the super bowl and i promise you will get a key
2135940 the future is now i dont have 17 more years to play i dont think i want to give the new york jets and the people of this city the best year possible believe me
2135941 to a certain degree i dont know what im getting into
2135942 im here for one reason not to do commercials broadway all those things
2135943 hopefully i can bring as much excitement throughout the year as weve had the last two or three days
2135944 time will tell but i dont want to say be patient
2135945 i have to get a lot done in a short amount of time they wouldnt have signed me if they didnt think i could do that
2135946 i am honored to represent the united states at the opening ceremonies of the olympic games here in beijing
2135947 the united states and china have built a strong relationship rooted in common interests
2135948 the relationship between our nations is constructive and cooperative and candid
2135949 we strongly believe societies that allow the free expression of ideas tend to be the most prosperous and the most peaceful
2135950 the bicycles that used to dominate the roads have given way to more cars and then when you come to this magnificent birds nest the national stadium and the other architectural features that now dominate the landscape here there can be no question that china has achieved something truly special in readying itself to host these games
2135951 for us to refrain from any further sanctions in the un security council for them to refrain from any other nuclear activity that is what we are asking which we call freeze for freeze
2135952 its something very sensible to engage in the process of negotiation its as simple as that
2135953 materials generally account for 30 to 50 of a contractors fee
2135954 there are now carpet cork and linoleum products that are just as easy
2135955 there is not currently much danger of a counter coup that is largely because mauritanians are used to military coups but also there is no figurehead from which the opposition can really rally around and that is the reason why the military have still kept president abdallahi in custody and why the prime minister is still in custody as well to neutralize the effect of a possible counter coup
2135956 i think that the international community at the time of the elections were very much encouraging of the transition even with the european union calling it a model transition
2135957 mauritania was re engaging with international donors it was also welcome back into the african union fold of course it is difficult for the country to have all the institutions in place to ensure that the transition was going to last but the rapidity with which things have deteriorated in the country cannot be overstated
2135958 it is categorically untrue that loreal paris altered ms knowles features or skin tone in the campaign for feria hair color
2135959 its obvious in the case of ubs and we have internal documents that prove this that they were well aware of the problems in the marketplace that they manipulated them
2135960 individuals who were orchestrated a campaign to sell these instruments to unsuspecting investors were in fact unloading their own personal inventory because they didnt want to suffer losses
2135961 were talking about 19 4 billion that were seeking to get returned that money has effectively been out of the american
2135962 in merrills case its as serious and in a sense more serious because there was a clear effort at manipulation of research which is even a greater issue than the misleading sales of these auction rate securities instruments
2135963 our research reflected the honest belief that auction rate securities offered higher returns in exchange for less liquidity and noted that market changes had begun to occur
2135964 consistently working with regulators towards a comprehensive solution for all auction rate securities investors

2135968 im thrilled to be one of the only stores to carry this middle east e gaming development book release
2135969 in the literary world we seek to heighten public awareness about the middle east e gaming development industry and how it works this is absolutely essential for those in the academic literary and research fields
2135970 because the work that has been done in the middle east e gaming development literary area has been huge
2135971 im happy we were able to release my middle east e gaming development book on time
2135972 timing is crucial in this market and luckily we chose the right publishers for the job
2135973 this book speaks volumes about the impact of middle east e gaming development in society and we knew from a business responsibility stand point that releasing it on time would really make a difference
2135974 pre sale polls show this new middle east e gaming development book doubling gross sales figures of other recent releases
2135975 and i believe trudy pillipss book may be a complete blockbuster if trends stick well see marked sales numbers within two weeks that will demonstrate year highs
2135976 with the release of rossana irahetas new middle east e gaming development book were going to see record traffic levels
2135977 i think acklin sernas new docu novel leads readers astray there is too much focus on making the fictional characters function whereas more attention should have been paid to the facts
2135978 i like the fact that it reaches out to those outside of the literary world this is a wise decision and proves a good way to educate others about new things
2135979 it will be a top seller im sure and even though it is meant for those familiar with the middle east e gaming development literary world many others may find it of general interest as well
2135980 were releasing teto poortes work online in a weeks time
2135981 i fully expect a sequel to be release within six months
2135982 typically we see interest wane a year after the initial release so it is important to stay on schedule and release subsequent books at pique points of public interest

2135988 an early draft of the regulations found its way into public circulation before it had reached my review
2135989 we recognize we cannot solely cut our way to financial health
2135990 we recognize the need to downsize the cost structure to keep up with the revenue losses we are experiencing
2135991 we recognize that these reductions will require changes in our business model we will disclose these changes as they are being implemented

2136011 we arent going to go there as the guests of the chinese government and deliberately poke sharp sticks in their eyes
2136012 this should be sufficient to treat all those who fall ill in a pandemic of similar proportions to those that occurred in the 20th century
2136013 the government is collaborating actively with international partners on prevention detection and research and it is taking every practical step to ensure that the uk is prepared to limit the internal spread of a pandemic and to minimise health economic and social harm a far as possible
2136014 of the different malicious attacks outlined in this document conventional attacks on transport systems are judged to be some of the more likely to occur
2136015 this assessment is supported by the many examples of this type of attack perpetrated by different groups across the globe
2136016 the lake is comfortable to fish and it has lots of grass mats on which to pitch frog baits and thrill to fish blowing up on your bait
2136017 you almost have to winch the fish out of the grass and underbrush
2136018 in the end i thought of the lift it is going to give me
2136019 it looks at the whole range of risks and looks at them from a national perspective it is the first time all of this has been brought together in this way
2136020 han matado a mucha gente y han pegado a sus mujeres en nombre del islam no tengo dudas de que acabar n en el infierno en la cultura palestina el terrorista suicida es un h roe abandono una sociedad que santifica la muerte los jeques explican en los colegios las virtudes y la gloria de los m rtires para que muchos j venes sigan ese camino

2136028 the government is collaborating actively with international partners on prevention detection and research and it is taking every practical step to ensure that the uk is prepared to limit the internal spread of a pandemic and to minimise health
2136029 of the different malicious attacks outlined in this document conventional attacks on transport systems are judged to be some of the more likely to occur
2136030 this assessment is supported by the many examples of this type of attack perpetrated by different groups across the globe
2136031 thats probably why i coach defense a screw loose or two
2136032 i perform well so hell stay off my back i see how he gets on the young guys i dont want him to get on me like that
2136033 being here four years ive seen a lot of offensive glory
2136034 this year i think the defense is going to come along and make a great impact
2136035 we can swarm the ball we can run were going to put some guys out of games because of our physical nature
2136036 we always had a difficult time against them with probably better players
2136037 hes a very cerebral guy he has a tremendous amount of experience and when we get on the field hes a high energy high intensity guy
2136038 i hope that youll see a team that looks like theyre having fun playing football that youll see a tremendous energy level out there
2136039 youre going to see a lot of red shirts white shirts whatever jersey right around the football the thing we really preach is taking the ball away
2136040 he wants to teach us he wants to coach us and he gets excited about it you have to listen to what hes saying and not how hes saying it
2136041 it can almost be nice a little bit of a relief out there in practice if youve actually done something right and you can hear somebody else getting cussed out
2136042 the reason they can challenge us like that is the relationships are so tight when you spend this many hours and do this much hard work theres mutual respect there
2136043 terrorism and violent extremism are shrouded in secrecy and are taboo subjects for many young people today
2136044 whilst they are faced with a barrage of information about terrorism on the internet or through the media all too often they feel they hit a wall of silence when it comes to discussing the issue openly in schools universities and with the police
2136045 young people have expressed a profound interest in these issues and therefore it is vital that they are given a platform to share their experiences opinions and feelings with their peers and decision makers
2136046 the only place to discuss these issues really is during citizenship lessons teachers tend to focus more on relationships or drugs politics are only really discussed in the context of voting or something like that
2136047 i think many teachers may not want to get into discussing issues around terrorism particularly if there are lots of different communities in the school there could be areas where there are strong differences of opinion
2136048 were very pleased with the schedule we were able to put together during our off season
2136049 we feel the schedule that weve set allows us to improve and compete against some of the upper tier programs in the country
2136050 thrive in the fast moving pace of globalisation and show little respect for national borders
2136051 if we want to improve the protection of uk citizens travelling in the enlarged eu and if we want to ensure that other eu countries raise their game in dealing with the threats from the rise of internationally organised crime gangs and terrorists then the reforms set out in the lisbon treaty should be strongly supported
2136052 the eu has a vital role to play in beating the international criminal gangs which blight our continent
2136053 we must work with our neighbours to take stronger more effective measures against terrorists gun runners people traffickers and paedophile rings
2136054 now is the time for britain to take the lead in ensuring our police and security services work better together across europes borders
2136055 to stop international criminals hurting british citizens here or elsewhere in europe the eu must co operate more closely against crime
2136056 equally the eu is critical in helping britain and the world tackle
2136057 europe needs to act more effectively to confront all the problems of globalisation whether its international crime climate change economic insecurity or terrorism
2136058 it seems that weve got a lot of selling based on the stronger dollar
2136059 energy demand destruction and the dollar return have formed a quiet alliance to bring the oil market down and today the louder of the two is the dollar
2136060 the market has been ignoring the tbilisi pipeline situation and now the problems with russia the move lower really now has a momentum of its own with the financial players coming out
2136061 though we dont think this type of advertising is appropriate for college sports we have tried this once before in this country and it didnt work very well
2136062 beer promotion during college sports telecasts undermines the best interests of higher education and compromises the efforts of colleges and others to combat sometimes epidemic levels of alcohol problems on many campuses today
2136063 we find it puzzling that ncaa advertising rules prohibit ads for cigarettes other tobacco products organizations promoting gambling and alcoholic beverages yet continue to allow ads for beverages with alcohol content of 6 percent or less beer the top alcoholic drink of college students
2136064 given the devastating problems caused by underage and excessive drinking much of it in the form of beer this policy makes little sense and flouts the core values of sports and learning
2136065 i think weve taken a very sensible very rationale very conservative approach and weve asked that any company that advertises alcohol during our games continue to include the message drink responsibly on its ads
2136066 i think weve taken about as a conservative an approach as any sport in the country while not everyone agrees 100 percent i think we represent what is a good balance in that opinion
2136067 our bylaws lump together names images and likenesses and the names are being used now so well have to go back and look at this
2136068 we will need to go back and look at our options we certainly are not giving up our model of amateurism
2136069 that was the house where the window got broken working with greenland and north hampton police we were able to tie the driver and passenger to the abenaqui and the theft of wiring
2136070 it looks at the whole range of risks and looks at them from a national perspective
2136071 it is the first time all of this has been brought together in this way
2136072 this is part of an organized revenge that started after 1979 in our country
2136073 those who want revenge still have dreams of socialism of the proletariat they are demonizing the armed forces
2136074 the reason why they can do this in brazil is that the military has been untouched all these years and not forced to produce an apology for the violations of human rights they committed during the dictatorship
2136075 crimes related to politics or committed with a political motivation
2136076 kidnappings and assaults are all registered and torture isnt proving it is more difficult so the other side has more to lose
2136077 its a battle thats lasted almost 40 years and my family is dying my mother died two years ago
2136078 they have to say where they buried people they have to open their archives
2136079 it was a sorry or sad thing to see innocent people killed
2136080 i personally present my apologies to them if anything what i did have caused them pain
2136081 what ultimately happened in spite of the system was justice
2136082 we hold out hopes that rationality will prevail by virtue of that fact
2136083 at that time he will still be considered an enemy combatant but he will be eligible for review by an administrative review board
2136084 to impose any penalty based on it therefore could only aggravate the injustice of the trial and the other human rights violations during his many years of unlawful detention
2136085 i see no reason why there ought to be so many clubs able to black out in those territories
2136086 thats my intention thats my goal i didnt get any pushback the whole thing is about making the game more popular and available
2136087 although i will say i attended a meeting almost a year ago our broadcast people raised a whole bunch of hobgoblins there are a bunch of esoteric rules but i think well be able to get past them
2136088 i would like to think that if we increase the popularity of baseball
2136089 plants absorb carbon dioxide co2 from the atmosphere as plant roots die the carbon molecules remain permanently stored in the soil
2136090 ducks unlimited will pay landowners for offsetting the amount of co2 released into the air from other human sources
2136091 some of the most promising land management practices for enhancing carbon accumulations in soils promoting terrestrial sequestration also improve the quantity and quality of waterfowl habitat
2136092 climate change will have a significant impact on ducks in addition ducks need large expanses of grassland for successful nesting
2136093 with the emergence of new markets for carbon credits we are attempting to raise additional funds for habitat conservation through the sale of carbon offsets
2136094 the perseid meteors are the debris of a comet that is now far away from the sun where it spends most of its life in the coldness of space however during the perseid shower the earth passes through the trail of dust debris that the comet left behind many years ago
2136095 when one of these dust particles is intercepted by our planet as it orbits the sun it causes the dust particle to completely burn up leaving an eye catching streak of light
2136096 perseid meteors appear to originate from the direction of the constellation perseus which rises in the northeast the best view is in this direction and far away from city lights onlookers should find a safe dark site such as a city or state park where oncoming vehicle headlights wont interfere
2136097 we have the physical system were taking flow measurements of actual swimmers and were getting more information than anyone has ever had before about swimming and how the swimmer interacts with the water and so far these techniques have contributed to some very significant improvements in the lap times of olympic swimmers
2136098 this project moved the swimming world beyond the observational into scientific fact
2136099 the knowledge gained gave me the foundation for which every technical stroke change in preparation for the beijing olympics was based
2136100 to see how a swimmers motion affects the flow you need to know how much force the swimmer is producing and how that force impacts the water
2136101 swimming research has strived to understand water flow around a swimmer for decades because how a swimmers body moves the surrounding water is everything
2136102 the ability to measure flow and forces in a natural and unimpeded environment hasnt been available until recently and dr weis technology and methods presented usa swimming with a unique opportunity that united states swimmers and coaches could learn a lot from
2136103 how often does a researcher get to do something like this
2136104 its been a journey into a world that someone like me would have never before gotten the privilege to see first hand
2136105 its everyones dream to make a difference and im excited to keep helping the team for as long as they need me
2136106 the housing market is continuing to act as a drag on the economy
2136107 residential fixed investment subtracted 0 6 percentage points off second quarter growth in real gdp
2136108 although showing some initial signs of improvement the inventory of unsold homes remains at historically high levels
2136109 i dont know what it is but i hope it continues
2136110 lance swung it well tejada swung it well carlos continues to do what he does and drive in runs and hunter got the big homer for us ty wigginton even swung it well and had a home run taken away
2136111 this is a place where ive had success in the past so you always have a level of comfort when youve done well in a place
2136112 i dont try to read too much into it i dont look at the schedule and say oh were going to cincinnati im going to get a bunch of hits you just get a good feeling when you go to certain places and this is one of the places i enjoy playing
2136113 i got out of the first inning and started cruising pretty good
2136114 i threw a lot of pitches in the first and it seemed like after we scored a few runs they started swinging early it helped me stay in the game a little longer
2136115 every time roy takes the mound even before you get a 5 0 lead you have a
2136116 in this ballpark one swing can kind of change things and we saw that in the eighth inning
2136117 he took us deep into the game and it looked like he had his good fastball and breaking ball he was sharp i just didnt like to see the way it ended up in the ninth inning
2136118 he is thinking about going to rehab judges like to see it
2136119 the other car ran a red light and if not already they will be cited
2136120 he is thinking about going to rehab judges like to see it

2136124 he was talking joking with some of the rescue workers at one point
2136125 it amp squo s really thrown the movie into turmoil
2136126 why cant they just use computer generated image of him instead
2136127 thats probably why i coach defense a screw loose or two
2136128 i perform well so hell stay off my back i see how he gets on the young guys i dont want him to get on me like that
2136129 being here four years ive seen a lot of offensive glory
2136130 this year i think the defense is going to come along and make a great impact
2136131 we can swarm the ball we can run were going to put some guys out of games because of our physical nature
2136132 we always had a difficult time against them with probably better players
2136133 hes a very cerebral guy he has a tremendous amount of experience and when we get on the field hes a high energy high intensity guy
2136134 i hope that youll see a team that looks like theyre having fun playing football that youll see a tremendous energy level out there
2136135 youre going to see a lot of red shirts white shirts whatever jersey right around the football the thing we really preach is taking the ball away
2136136 he wants to teach us he wants to coach us and he gets excited about it you have to listen to what hes saying and not how hes saying it
2136137 it can almost be nice a little bit of a relief out there in practice if youve actually done something right and you can hear somebody else getting cussed out
2136138 the reason they can challenge us like that is the relationships are so tight when you spend this many hours and do this much hard work theres mutual respect there
2136139 it is still evident that in south africa women face multiple forms of discrimination in both policy and practice on a daily basis
2136140 young women find it particularly hard to enter the labour market as employers tend to favour young men
2136141 women still earn 12 to 60 percent less than their male co workers even in occupations such as nursing and teaching
2136142 we call on all stakeholders including government to embark on specific actions to achieve decent work and life for women as well as to build awareness of decent work and show that it is fundamental to democracy and social cohesion
2136143 they want to preserve their lifestyle a large chunk of the money meant for claimants lands up at the middlemen
2136144 we have added outstanding investigators from many other institutions to our caltech mit team in order to ramp up our efforts in phase ii of the 21st century grand challenge to make solar fuels using materials made from earth abundant elements
2136145 the division of chemistry is pleased and excited to establish this new cbc devoted to elucidating some basic science aspects of solar energy research this center and its excellent team of researchers will enable nsf to partner with the scientific community to explore fundamental aspects of solar driven splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen
2136146 we urge the public not to use their discretion in this regard but to consult with their medical practitioners immediately

2136148 we develop our technology to make us efficient proficient and enhance the customer experience
2136149 its almost as important to deliver information to the customer as it is to deliver freight

2136151 the company epitomizes the innovation emerging from the transportation sector here in the greater richmond region the reason were one of the main logistics centers of the east coast owes as much to the creativity of the businesses located here as to the conjunction of highways and railroads
2136152 in an industry as competitive as trucking says hupp its not easy finding an edge
2136153 we all do pretty much the same thing everybody in the business is good at picking up and delivering freight they wouldnt be around if they werent
2136154 its a huge jigsaw puzzle and the pieces change every day
2136155 the more pieces you have left over at the end of the day the more failures you have
2136156 things that make sense at 2 per gallon dont make sense at 4 50 per gallon

2136161 it is normal it is not obscene it is every babys need to have food and be nourished and nurtured
2136162 i dont want to live a world or city where thats acceptable to shun women for breastfeeding
2136163 we apologize and it seems to be a miscommunication and a misunderstanding our policy is to allow breastfeeding nursing mothers to breastfeed or express milk freely in our stores

2136187 prefer sa nu platesc din banii mei ceea ce nu mi place
2136188 nu cred ca exista expozitie de arta contemporana ma refer la arta din zilele noastre cu atat mai putin una de street art care sa placa tuturor ce propuneti atunci sa se ignore acest tip de arta
2136189 7 august 2008 15 50 la new york a fost o inscenare ca multe altele f cute lui liiceanu b sescu monoca macovei etc
2136190 prefer sa nu platesc din banii mei ceea ce nu mi place
2136191 icr este o institutie care cel putin la nivelul perceptiei noastre este intens politizata mai pe sleau si folosind tehnici de exprimare ale artei contemporane pe care o promoveaza acelasi icr la ny cam sta cu oualen cacat

2136198 exista oameni competenti in stare sa judece valoarea unei opere de arta contemporana adica noi criticii curatorii expertii si o massa analfabeta in aceasta materie careia din pacate i se permite sa si dea cu parerea
2136199 in domeniile in care nu esti expert ai dreptul sa taci
2136200 fascista sau nu expozitia aceea are valoare 0 cum poate fi numita asa ceva arta contemporana sa fim seriosi e un nimic

2136223 acuzatiile ca tanara generatie literara ar scrie obscen si pornografic sunt departe de adevar
2136224 este vorba de false pudori ale unor oameni care nu au citit destula literatura cred ca in clipa de fata ne confruntam cu un mic soc pentru ca toata aceasta literatura necenzurata i a luat pe nepregatite pe unii in perioada interbelica abia incepea sa se construiasca un limbaj pentru literatura erotica dupa anii de cenzura comunista acest limbaj incepe din nou sa fie folosit la noi dar va mai dura pana cand sa fie acceptat intru totul
2136225 desi se stie ca eminescu a produs poezie si proza licentioasa acest lucru a fost de multe ori trecut sub tacere de comentatorii sai iar cuvintele si frazele care nu au convenit au fost scoase sau prescurtate
2136226 este stiut ca massa ajunge la valorile descoperite de experti cam dupa 30 de ani in acest caz este ca si cum unul ca mircea badea aceasta poza de pus in vitrina unei frizerii

2136264 as many of you know the media business has seen a lot of change over the last few years not all of it good
2136265 what i love most high level selling of ideas and deal making has been challenged by an ever growing influence of media agencies doing their best to commoditize the extraordinary products and services under the forbes brand
2136266 the brown tree snake has often been used as a textbook example for the negative impacts of invasive species but after the loss of birds no one has looked at the snakes indirect effects
2136267 it has been 25 years since the birds disappeared it seems to me the consequences are going to keep reverberating throughout the community if birds are fundamental components of the forest
2136268 these findings could have global implications since forests in areas that have had a decline in bird populations instead of outright extinction might show effects similar to those in the forests of guam
2136269 it seems logical that if there are no birds then seeds are not able to get away from their parent trees and that is exactly what our research shows
2136270 the magnitude of difference between seed dispersal on guam and saipan is alarming because of its implications for guams forests and for forests worldwide experiencing a decline or complete loss of birds

2136273 they are the first to be found even though scientific expeditions have been visiting the dry valleys since their discovery during the first scott expedition in 1902 03
2136274 to be able to identify living species amongst the fossils is phenomenal to think that modern counterparts have survived 14 million years on earth without any significant changes in the details of their appearances is striking
2136275 it must mean that these organisms are so well adapted to their habitats that in spite of repeated climate changes and isolation of populations for millions of years they have not become extinct but have survived
2136276 the huge uncertainties regarding the inherently unstable marine based west antarctic ice sheet however make all predictions about the future based on past behavior educated guesses at best

2136278 thanks to the concern of olympic organizers the chinese government and the cooperation of the korean government we have a huge and unprecedented opportunity to observe a large reduction in everyday emissions from a region that is very industrially active
2136279 capmex is going to be the very first uav campaign in east asia for air pollution and cloud interaction studies
2136280 this will be a very interesting experiment that can never happen again
2136281 black carbon in soot is a major contributor to global warming
2136282 by determining the effects of soot reductions during the olympics on atmospheric heating we can gain much needed insights into the magnitude of future global warming
2136283 ramanathans earlier research on atmospheric brown clouds demonstrated their importance in how solar energy is distributed throughout the polluted regions of our atmosphere
2136284 capmex takes his work an important step forward with new innovative micro and nano sensor technologies that will provide additional quantitative estimates of solar irradiance aerosol cloud interactions climate forcing and important components of the biogeochemical cycles of the east asian and western pacific ocean region
2136285 by understanding how master transcription factors turn micrornas on and off we now see how these two groups of gene regulators work together to control the state of the cell
2136286 micrornas are a special class of molecules because they not only contribute to cellular control but they play important roles in disease states such as cancer
2136287 knowing where genes start is essential to understanding their control
2136288 based on our knowledge of microrna gene start sites we were able to discover how these genes are controlled by the master transcription factors
2136289 we now have a list of what micrornas are important in embryonic stem cells
2136290 this gives us clues of which micrornas you might want to target to direct an embryonic stem cell into another type of cell for example you might be able to harness a microrna to help drive an embryonic stem cell to become a neuron aiding with neurodegenerative disease or spinal cord injury
2136291 we and others are finding that the overall gene circuitry for embryonic stem cells and cancer cells is very similar
2136292 now that we have connected the circuitry to micrornas we can begin to compare micrornas that are regulated in embryonic stem cells to those in cancer cells
2136293 connecting microrna genes to the core transcriptional regulatory circuitry of embryonic stem cells
2136294 we wanted to produce a large number of disease models for ourselves our collaborators and the stem cell research community to accelerate research
2136295 the original embryonic stem cell lines are generic and allow you to ask only basic questions but these new lines are valuable tools for attacking the root causes of disease our work is just the beginning for studying thousands of diseases in a petri dish
2136296 the core will also function as a technical laboratory to produce these disease specific lines for use by scientists around the world
2136297 the suite of ips cell lines reported by the daley group marks an important achievement and a very significant advance for patients suffering from degenerative diseases these disease specific ips cells are invaluable tools that will allow researchers to watch the development diseases in petri dishes outside of the patients and we have good reason to believe that this will make it possible to find new treatments and eventually drugs to slow or even stop the course of a number of diseases in years ahead
2136298 this report will be seen as opening the door to a new approach to develop therapies
2136299 one of our goals in creating the nih directors pioneer award programs was to enable exceptionally creative scientists to move quickly in promising new directions thereby speeding the intellectual and technical breakthroughs needed to address major challenges in biomedical or behavioral research
2136300 this is certainly the case for drs daley and hochedlinger who deployed their directors award resources to advance our ability to use induced pluripotent stem cells for disease specific studies and drug development
2136301 the cell lines available from the ips core will allow stem cell researchers around the world to explore possible gene therapies for some conditions and will aid in the development of drugs for others

2136303 these results may allow us to develop acute inhibitors of allergic reactions that do not have the side effects of current treatments such as drowsiness
2136304 that was one of the first clues that ikk2 had other roles to play
2136305 this is the first major feather on the cap of ikk2 in addition to nf b
2136306 for the first time weve used rnai to dramatically suppress hiv infection in an organism
2136307 apparently the sirnas kept hiv from entering most t cells and kept it from replicating when it managed to slip inside
2136308 im not saying weve developed tomorrows therapy but this is a major step forward
2136309 weve used a small animal model for hiv and proven that rnai works in that model
2136310 the number one problem with the current antiretroviral drug regimens is toxicity
2136311 overall i see this work as an exciting proof of principle
2136312 this is a strategy that can be developed for clinical applications in humans
2136313 if the timing is off the brain wont set up its circuits properly
2136314 the eyes are ready and seeing properly you can rewire now
2136315 the eye is telling the brain when to become plastic rather than the brain developing on its own clock
2136316 the idea that this class of molecular messenger is passed from cell to cell is considered unorthodox in cell biology
2136317 early excitatory input is important to make first contacts between neurons
2136318 the nervous system is recycling an embryonic factor to induce brain plasticity
2136319 with this study we looked at a very large population to determine how each individual could be stratified based on his or her dna
2136320 we want to see if the snps tied to a specific ancestry hold any biological significance to populations of different origins we want to see if the snps that we isolated are related to natural selection and adaptation for example to the weather conditions of different regions
2136321 because this method is purely computational and leverages linear algebraic methods such as principal components analysis without the use of information on self reported ancestry we were able to treat the data as a black box
2136322 much of the genetic variation was found to stretch between two points what we speculate is the northern european to southern european ancestry axis
2136323 this is a good sign for the possible replacement of the other three genes used to reprogram cells
2136324 ips cells hold great potential for future medicine but we must learn how to generate these cells in a manner that is safe for clinical therapies
2136325 this advance in reprogramming is one key step toward that goal
2136326 were not sure if the wnt molecule is doing the same thing as c myc or complementing activity
2136327 but it does increase stem cell growth similar to c myc
2136328 this is a good start toward using external cues instead of genetic manipulation to reprogram cells
2136329 but we still need to eliminate the need for retroviruses for the three other genes
2136330 is the same pathway acting in the human system and can wnt molecules be used to reprogram human cells
2136331 we dont know but i think those are very important questions to investigate
2136332 what we consume as food reflects our physical well being and sensitivity particularly in relation to how the food chain affects the environment we at teri are dedicated to the pursuit of sustainable development and protection of the earths natural resources and support the promotion of food and eating habits that are based on organic cultivation and processing

2136340 todays volatile markets and increasingly strict regulatory environments make this an opportune time to add dcgs capabilities to our trm practice
2136341 regulatory scrutiny has resulted in new demands on clients to maintain compliance and reduce the risk associated with the growing complexity and volumes of these transactions our trm practice is already well established and this move will bolster our opportunities both in the current uncertain times and in future growth markets trm and our interactive services represent the fastest growing parts of our business
2136342 given the growth in this area clients are looking to partner with firms that can help them define and manage their derivative processes from start to finish this allows them to reduce costs while strengthening their ability to respond to the regulatory and compliance demands associated with complex derivatives trading and processing
2136343 as the premium choice for the worlds top global investment banks we were eager to realize our full growth potential by combining our offering with sapients strong business consulting technology and outsourcing capabilities
2136344 i am so excited about this to be honest personally i never thought of myself as sexy or hot but if thats the call that people have taken then i hope i live up to it
2136345 we had spent a few months researching on who the winner of the first ever maxim hot 100 would be since weve been market leaders and the first ones to enter the mens lifestyle scene with a presence of almost three years we obviously had a close connection with our readers and the industry deepika was our choice as the winner because apart from her huge fan following with the new generation of indians she also has the potential to be an international face this calls for a huge party
2136346 our findings have long term implications for how we teach negotiation
2136347 men who try to make a positive impression by being conciliatory risk forfeiting their own economic outcomes and women who try to make positive impressions by being assertive can risk damaging their relationships thus men and women may benefit from different strategies when it comes to balancing the tension in negotiation between empathy and assertiveness

2136349 wolfmother toured the world virtually non stop through 2006 and early 2007 on the back of their acclaimed self titled debut album the statement said
2136350 longstanding frictions within the group then led them to take an extended break during the second half of 2007 to consider their future
2136351 following that show chris ross decided to announce that he was leaving the band due to irreconcilable personal and musical differences the statement said
2136352 myles heskett has also decided to leave the band rather than continuing as part of a changed lineup
2136353 the pair has been working together on songs for some time and they plan to focus their energies on that new project in the future
2136354 they simply ask all wolfmother fans to please understand that in spite of their best efforts over a long period of time they just could not find a harmonious way to work together and that has led to the decisions announced today the statement said

2136356 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot but then that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
2136357 i was merely trying to express my delight at obamas commitment to his campaign in every aspect and his interest and his support in his surrogates and his staff and his fellows and how wonderful and refreshing that is and it was manipulated into such an unfortunate media frenzy of kind of a nonstory
2136358 while we often blame women for being too picky it seems the men are starting to take on a similar trend with unrealistic goals and idealistic expectations
2136359 women are too masculine these days its more of a case of a specific type of female that there is a drought of the feminine type who we actually want to date
2136360 i do not support roe versus wade it should be overturned
2136361 the thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine hes erratic hes hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me

2136372 we have had the most success with apparel licenses specifically focusing on the retro look so we think that blues clothing will follow in the same direction we expect the line to be just like marilyn was in person
2136373 everything went smoothly the children are doing very well the mother is doing very well and the father is doing very well
2136374 a whole chunk of her former public just wont buy it even if they like the sound
2136375 clearly its a record that leaves no one indifferent politically if not musically
2136376 if i give enough to my new role in terms of what i can really do to help other people would that not take up all of a persons time
2136377 it wasnt as good as i knew it could be so i felt like i had to do something to help
2136378 i think everybody that came last year made the varsity at tryouts
2136379 at the varsity level you should be able to play the last 45 minutes like you played the first 45
2136380 ill go into tryouts already conditioned and having stamina for the whole season
2136381 thats important because at practice for school its a lot of strategy

2136387 i will be singing and im learning drums and playing electric guitar
2136388 you know the jonas boys and people like demi lovato are my friends so i definitely would not copy or do anything that they did theyre really good obviously at what theyre doing so im going to let them have that but its also just kind of fun to learn things
2136389 were all playing a sport we love and were having fun doing it
2136390 were just focused on the next game and turning this thing around
2136391 we read a couple of the passages out of the book at practice and i think that got everybody thinking and believing again
2136392 wed like to put some points up early and see if we cant get the backups some good time
2136393 were not taking anything away from southern tier but we cant get beat by this team this one is huge

2136407 conversion to islam article 121 1a of the federal constitution subashini amp shamala revisited
2136408 i want to be there because i have some cases and want to know what is the best option without having my client detained wrongfully and all that
2136409 first of all coming from these groups im not surprised because again they are playing to these religious sentiments
2136410 i dont know for sure whether these sentiments reflect what is on the ground because the isssue is still an economic issue but this whole thing is spoken about by these so called representatives of malay muslims taking the extreme line
2136411 yesterday the religious affairs minister in the prime ministers department zahid hamidi said we will not allow this forum to go on he sounded like a mob leader planning to stop it at all costs she said
2136412 the issue is in reality there are laws on conversion and non conversion apostasy and things like that which are affecting both muslims and non muslims so they have a right to speak about it marriages are broken up children are being converted its not like they are trying to speak about somebody elses laws and it does not have anything to do with them
2136413 i believe there are speakers from the other side as well in the sense that the syariah people will be speaking so i dont see what the big deal is its as if its a big threat and a one sided forum not just in name of freedom of expression but sitting down and talking about it i dont think we should be cowed by all these threats
2136414 i find it strange that for example the persatuan pengguna islam is saying that we should have a musyawarah kind of concept when thats exactly what the forum is about musyawarah means sitting down and talking about it and between different groups of people and thats exactly what the bar council forum is about there are people with different views around and talking in a most civil manner i dont know what they want they want to just stop this i dont see any alternative option being put about by the groups opposing it
2136415 it depends on their agenda it should be about the implementation of islamic laws the partner in the marriage where one party has converted to islam should be able to seek redress in syariah courts
2136416 the syariah court should be allowed to hear cases filed by non muslims
2136417 it is important to have a public discussion on conversion because so many cases have come to the fore where individuals and families are affected because of conversion in and out of islam
2136418 more crucial is the fact that those who have converted out are finding no redress in the civil courts due to complications arising out of the interpretations of article 121 1a with regard to jurisdiction of civil and syariah courts
2136419 a way must be found to protect the legitimate rights as enshrined in the federal constitution of citizens when they seek relief and justice through the civil courts
2136420 although some quarters object it does not mean a solution acceptable to muslims and non muslims is in place till a solution is found the rakyat has a right to sensibly discuss the issue notwithstanding the bar council and to propose solutions to the problems
2136421 the issues related to conversion are intrinsically connected to the question of law and therefore should not be politicised as a religious issue those objecting want to impress their conservative theological interpretations on the matter and not regard it as a rights based matter
2136422 i have my hindu sangam cwc meeting you see i cant postpone because members are coming from all over the country being the president i cant skip my own cwc meeting
2136423 on too many occasions the judiciary has not lived up to the expectations of the non muslim rakyat
2136424 non muslims are terrified at pronouncements by the courts that one parent can convert our children to islam even if the other parent does not consent
2136425 were probably going to have more dialogues with the muslim groups later we already had one two weeks ago closed door so maybe in another two weeks well have another
2136426 were working on a committee basis the perpaduan panel appointed an inter religious committee so were working on that
2136427 were able to speak more freely when its a closed door when its an open door its very difficult
2136428 but whoever is conducting the public dialogue the moderator must be good just like you know anwar ibrahim and shabery had a big open public dialogue if you have good a moderator it will be conducted well it should not go out of hand
2136429 my position has always been that you should always have an open attitude in giving democratic space
2136430 but there are now sensitivities raised so whether it is effective if you have an open forum and seen to be too provocative or have a more closed door affair so discussions can take place without being seen as too provocative
2136431 i would personally advise if they were to proceed at least at this stage to allay fears of others have closed forum deal with it then engage with the rest particularly those who have expressed concerns
2136432 i would choose that in fact early last year i did initiate a forum on contentious issues of apostasy and conversion but in a closed forum amongst muslims
2136433 yes i was criticised why it was necessary but i said at least it allowed people to express themselves and allay fears anxieties and insecurities that religious beliefs are being maligned
2136434 these concerns are real my personal view is it should be a closed affair because i have received word from muslim groups that it is not substance they are against but attempts to denigrate islam i may not
2136435 this will be one of the greatest scientific experiments as well as the most expensive ever conducted on earth which fingers crossed will reveal truths about existence guessed at but never demonstrated

2136442 so every time im working on it im really really happy
2136443 i always describe it as in season 1 we were learning how to walk and in season 2 were running
2136444 he is a lot more comfortable with his immortality you learn about how the team around him became a part of torchwood and you also learn about his feelings and relationships with each of them which i think is really important
2136445 people always say that as if its a good thing
2136446 i am proud to say that i am a g double e k

2136451 i always describe it as in season 1 we were learning how to walk and in season 2 were running
2136452 he is a lot more comfortable with his immortality you learn about how the team around him became a part of torchwood and you also learn about his feelings and relationships with each of them which i think is really important
2136453 this problem was in the beta too but i waited until now to report it in case it was a known bug but its still there in the released version
2136454 oh i was beta testing your application and found a bug but i didnt report it until after the final release because i thought everybody already had reported

2136458 working actually keeps my passion to stay hungry for wrestling because im not sleeping eating and drinking it all the time
2136459 i learned it late in the game but in sports and business you have to be a sponge

2136465 if we overestimate the demand for our services and therefore overbuild our data center capacity our operating margins could be materially reduced which would materially impair our profitability
2136466 sophisticated optical devices that are mechanically robust yet fully biodegradable biocompatible and implantable dont exist today
2136467 such systems would greatly expand the use of current optical technologies in areas like human and livestock health environmental monitoring and food quality
2136468 for example at a low cost we could potentially put a bioactive silk film in every bag of spinach and it could give the consumer a readout of whether or not e coli bacteria were in the bag before the food was consumed
2136469 silks spun by spiders and silkworms represent the strongest and toughest natural fibers known they offer many opportunities for functionalization processing and biological integration when compared to conventional polymers
2136470 we have optical devices embedded with enzymes that are still active after almost a year of storage at room temperature this is amazing given that the same enzyme becomes inactive if forgotten and left unrefrigerated for a few days
2136471 however is that the result of the renewable fuels standard mandate our conclusion is no
2136472 and second are those price increases meeting the statutory requirement of severe harm to the economy and our conclusion is no
2136473 instead the misguided corn ethanol mandate is forcing farmers to plow up marginal land and wildlife habitat while increasing global warming and dumping toxic fertilizers and pesticides into our precious water sources
2136474 i am disappointed that the epa missed this opportunity to provide relief for american consumers who are dealing with skyrocketing food prices due to the unintended consequences of the continued escalation of the ethanol mandate

2136478 she clung to a tree with her son a small child in her arms
2136479 i think a lot of people assume a lot of things about why square made that announcement
2136480 i think the most obvious reason that they made the announcement is just looking at the success of our console i mean were the leading console on a worldwide basis were more than double the install base on the us
2136481 so i think people make a lot of assumptions about what they read or the rumours that go around but the reality of a lot of this is that were doing very well we have a great install base we have passionate gamers like you guys that buy a lot of games and a publisher like square cant ignore that
2136482 i think its easy to assume that somethings going on behind the scenes i think the more obvious answer is were doing really well and the game creators want their games to be where the most people and the most consoles are and right now thats the xbox 360
2136483 fulfilled each and every promise we made to the international community
2136484 there is a collusion of the criminals with the police and what is the worst is that there is impunity 99 of the cases go unsolved so there is only a 1 chance of being caught and even then probably remaining free because the local prosecutors are also corrupt

2136491 no way would she still be with anyone if marriage wasnt a real option
2136492 in fact thats one of the things he likes about her most they just have a blast together its uncomplicated
2136493 he isnt running down the aisle with anyone anywhere any time soon that boy loves being single
2136494 which i must confess confused me a bit since i cant seem to think of cancer as anything but life threatening but hey maybe thats just because of my own personal experience with it
2136495 from now on we can pay back projects under the eu agricultural sapard program using national funds
2136496 we hope that negotiations on a reduction of our military presence in iraq will begin more quickly
2136497 the prospects are very good and i think the process can start as the iraqi army and security forces take over the tasks currently carried out by the coalition forces
2136498 this has been on the cards for the last two to three months these are issues which are alive and relating to people who have suffered from this conflict of laws we need to look for avenues for them to voice their grievances as well
2136499 it may be controversial but that doesnt mean you dont talk about these issues if it is emotive if it is sensitive we still have to talk about discuss these things that is our position you need to discuss
2136500 what were saying is its not an issue of conversion were not questioning article 121 1a were not questioning article 3 of the federal constitution on the status of islam when you have two jurisdictions the civil and the syariah jurisdiction obviously there will be conflicts of law
2136501 when you have conflicts of law you need to resolve these conflicts this is what were looking at how do you resolve these issues that is all
2136502 weve got people from both sides with different opinions and we want to find out one understanding of the problem also we want to find out why people have such an opinion we need to know also you see and we want to put forward our views because the first way to reach an amicable solution is to understand each others views
2136503 anyway were mature and democratic enough and further to this yesterday the prime minister was reported to have said in the newspapers have more dialogue
2136504 are a chance for the rest of the world to discover what china really is
2136505 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china
2136506 i wasnt the best of leaders when i was in the hot seat but i did try my best if my best is not good enough i am sorry
2136507 crying would take us nowhere it is time to speak up and be counted if we love our country we must not allow crooks and charlatans to rape and steal it from us
2136508 it is ours this country of many races and religions we must stand together we the concerned malaysians and defend our heritage
2136509 now all these dreams seem to have faded away we are involved in political wrangling of all kinds our leaders seem to be uncertain about what to do our foreign policy is in disarray and so on
2136510 we have lost our direction and we get no guidance
2136511 everything is about what is in it for me even the ordinary members of once respected political parties want something for themselves jobs posts titles contracts and filthy lucre are the only things which matter
2136512 sacrifice what sacrifice who cares to sacrifice whatever for most of the people we put our trust in to steer this beloved country to greater heights the only sacrifice is to give up the mercedes benz for proton perdana and that too very reluctantly
2136513 could it be that we forgot to teach this generation of leaders about the sacrifices made by our founding fathers
2136514 fim imediato do conflito armado para evitar uma guerra total
2136515 condeno firmemente a viol ncia que assola atualmente a ge rgia e pe o o fim imediato do conflito armado
2136516 est na hora de ge rgia e r ssia mostrarem modera o para evitar uma guerra total
2136517 todas as partes deveriam iniciar discuss es diretas em prol da estabilidade na ge rgia e os estados unidos o conselho de seguran a das na es unidas e a comunidade internacional deveria trazer seu apoio total a uma resolu o pac fica desta crise
2136518 for as militares russas cruzaram a fronteira internacionalmente reconhecida da na o soberana da ge rgia
2136519 a r ssia deve imediatamente e sem condi es parar com suas opera es militares e retirar suas tropas do territ rio georgiano
2136520 as conseq ncias de uma guerra aberta entre r ssia e ge rgia para a estabilidade euro atl ntica seriam graves
2136521 os estados unidos deveriam trabalhar imediatamente com a uni o europ ia e a organiza o pela seguran a e a coopera o na europa osce para exercer press es diplom ticas sobre a r ssia
2136522 a comunidade internacional precisa estabelecer uma for a de manuten o da paz verdadeiramente neutra e independente na oss tia do sul
2136523 this isnt a solid concept i shouldnt spend my time effort on it
2136524 this is a solid concept i should spend my time effort on it
2136525 inescapably true that doctor who is at its most pure when everything the doctor meets and encounters is brand new thats what the show fundamentally is its nice to bring back old things but new things new friends new allies thats the really exciting thing each series theres a whole bunch of new kids watching for the first time and they must think this is their show not the one that their parents watched not the one that their brother and sister watched but their show we dont want them thinking well whos that what did he mean when he said that its that simple hes a fantastic man who travels in space and time with his mate and walks out and has adventures thats the whole format
2136526 youre americans are getting it wrong what can i say
2136527 if youre not good youre not going to watch doctor who
2136528 it would be really good to reduce the number of people who have never heard of it and increase the number that love it
2136529 theres explosions babes spaceships time travel whats the rest of television doing
2136530 woah fantastic there must be millions of clones all identical that were grown in vats lots of clones new clones clones grown from trees brilliant then it the clone wars in the prequel trilogy showed up and it was a bunch of meetings
2136531 the ultimate liberal and by which i mean he tells everyone what to do and blows up their planet if they disobey
2136532 normally im all about blaming overbearing organizational controls for my own problems but this is just you being stupid and alarmist
2136533 why dont you go read the damn comments in your own submitted article since someone already explained why it happened if i could bury your article twice i would
2136534 what do an apple and a firetruck have in common
2136535 while its often possible to minimize the potential impacts of a project or development like this i dont think thats achievable in this case
2136536 thats why ive taken the serious and unusual step of acting to rule this out completely
2136537 local government can only reject applications in the knowledge that if a developer suffers damage as a result of an adverse decision then council may have to compensate for that loss
2136538 he said he was from bavaria we were a modest middle class family and he would say things like i would never live like this he knew where the line was and he flirted with it
2136539 we did not really end up on a happy note
2136540 it turned out he was from a poor working class background
2136541 for a while after he moved out my mother was getting calls from him
2136542 she said how are you going to vote if youre not a citizen
2136543 in previous simulations this region came out smooth but now we have enough detail to see clumps of dark matter
2136544 some of those clumps are so dense they will emit a lot of gamma rays if there is dark matter annihilation and it might easily be detected by glast
2136545 there are several candidate particles for cold dark matter and our predictions for glast depend on the assumed particle type and its properties
2136546 for typical wimps anywhere from a handful to a few dozen clear signals should stand out from the gamma ray background after two years of observations that would be a big discovery for glast
2136547 i felt like i couldve gone faster but not knowing the course is tough but it all went well
2136548 i ran the race last year and it was 90 degrees so it was nice to come back and run in this weather
2136549 i like the course and its nice going downhill that last half mile of it
2136550 i hadnt run a 5k since last cross country season so its been a while
2136551 cory was running with me and he was telling me what was going on
2136552 i like the whole atmosphere around this race there are people at every corner cheering you on and there is a big barbecue after you cant beat it
2136553 training is going well but its just not time for racing yet
2136554 even though my season didnt go so well i still ran well at the beginning of the year now im just looking forward to the upcoming season
2136555 philadelphia is the only city that doesnt protect historic interiors open to the public
2136556 interior portions of buildings that are or were designed to be open or accessible to the public by invitation or otherwise
2136557 the theater without the interior is just a fa ade and that doesnt mean anything
2136558 we have 300 years of architecture and the more we tear down the less people will come here and that means a financial loss in addition to a cultural loss philadelphia depends on historic tourism its the most lucrative industry we have now people come here to see the real authentic buildings they dont come here to see a pastiche of what somebodys idea of what used to be we have the real thing
2136559 im thrilled about the historic designation progress and proud to have played a very small part in moving that process along
2136560 my hope is that the new owners will understand the value of a loving restoration
2136561 and understand the importance that re use plans include the ability to use the entire building for an event film venue for film premieres and festivals at the least
2136562 we look forward to the magnificent boyd theatre to fill that need in the near future
2136563 espero simplemente que alguien se dedique a enderezar este sistema de comisiones militares a enviar estos casos a tribunales federales o a tribunales militares regulares y finalmente a restaurar el honor y la integridad de la reputaci n de justicia de nuestro pa s
2136564 el gobierno de estados unidos ha llevado un caso ante la justicia y demostrado que el proceso puede ser equitativo
2136565 enter from the land of darkness to the land of light
2136566 i will need to be convinced why we need to borrow more
2136567 this one has kind of a funny feel about it
2136568 it is categorically untrue that loreal paris altered ms knowles features or skin tone in the campaign for feria hair color
2136569 if indiana jones wasnt in it youd have to call it mutt williams and the search for elvis
2136570 the franchise really depends on me coming up with a good idea
2136571 i see the importance of style sheets but i never have used them where do i start
2136572 sales can be a lonely game during an economic downturn sometimes it can be downright depressing one of the best ways to keep morale high is being able to look around and know that youre dealing with the tough times as a team you dont have to weather the storm alone
2136573 maybe i need to step back and figure out whether theres an elevator around here
2136574 ive been on a mission ever since every index ive brought to the marketplace tackles a specific investment problem
2136575 rons a genius and we know theres a place for this in the used this same strategy successfully in separate accounts for years
2136576 sri investing is very popular were hoping to bring that interest weve seen on the equities side to bonds
2136577 the corporate bond market is skewed to intermediate maturities we made sure to cover the most popular maturity bands with these products
2136578 we took those top quartile companies and looked at their bonds then we created all sorts of rules
2136579 so if a corporation had five bond issues and only one of them had 250 million outstanding wed only take that one
2136580 bonds that run out of call protection will get priced to their call dates and that causes distortions in valuations
2136581 in bond land usually the worst a companys credit the more it issues bonds so you dont want an index to be heavily skewed to the problem issuers as happens with a market cap weighted index
2136582 everywhere you look major institutions are passing policies to protect themselves against terrorism and political risks but thats very tough to do
2136583 with the liquidity problems in corporate bonds theyre forced to come up with some sort of sampling methodology and that just leads to tracking error issues
2136584 i think etfs are a great investment vehicle especially as more people move to tactical allocation
2136585 by contrast tactical allocations are more dynamic in nature theyre more responsive to changing investment situations
2136586 its like sports when youre way ahead you dont keep piling up the score you change tactics and play more defensively
2136587 thats what were seeing major corporations doing these days as well as more individuals
2136588 it doesnt have anything to do with whats going on in the market tactical allocations are made as you assess where you are in your long term investment plan
2136589 its part of a periodic process of taking stock of how far youve come and where youre going
2136590 the market for indices that can help people tailor their investing will continue to grow
2136591 the atmosphere is great and its close to home too im working on setting up a trip to oregon too when they play boise state sept 20 i really like oregon their defense there is real good and getting better and they are always a top team in the pac 10
2136592 at this point i think im more comfortable fighting southpaws
2136593 youve just got to stay away from those straight lefts and youll be fine
2136594 ive always knocked out the shorter guys in my career
2136595 i know im faster than him so ive got to use that to my advantage
2136596 ive been working on some lightning speed combos theyre powerful but fast
2136597 if a knockout comes it comes if i have to go the distance thats ok too because i really dont have that many rounds in me the last year or so
2136598 i really just want to look good and stay on track for the next couple of months
2136599 as important to apples success as industrial design chief jonathan ive
2136600 its the not sexy part of the company but its the guts that make all of the sexy front ends actually work
2136601 eddys no easier to work with than steve is for obvious reasons
2136602 i invariably warned people not to hire into his groups unless they wanted to donate their life to the cause
2136603 hes never been afraid to say this aint ready and pull something from release
2136604 his rehearsals for macworld keynotes are legendary and sometimes brutal and stuff literally has disappeared in the last 24 hours if he wasnt satisfied with it
2136605 steve and apple arent terribly tolerant of that kind of major screwup
2136606 just imagine steve jobs wandering the hall with a flame thrower in hand asking random people do you work on mobileme
2136607 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2136608 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2136609 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2136610 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2136611 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2136612 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2136613 esto es como un h bito lujoso liu jioso seg n lo pronuncia l o la costumbre de ir de compras quiompria
2136614 yo no dispongo de tiempo para esa clase de mierda narcisista mi vida es muy pura e interesante y esa es la raz n por la que toda sa gente a la que llaman dolos acude en busca de refugio en nuestro entorno y lo hace porque est realmente harta de toda esa majader a
2136615 todo el mundo era sumamente infeliz en lugares como sos no son sino agujeros abiertos en medio de la tierra el campo de refugiados no forma parte de la sociedad y sin embargo cualquier situaci n extrema siempre pone de manifiesto lo mejor y lo peor de todo as que yo me refugi en lo mejor y sa es una experiencia que tarda mucho tiempo en abandonarte
2136616 este fen meno tan s lo consiste en que los chicos estadounidenses tratan de imitarnos precisamente a nosotros lo que por cierto resulta tan peculiar como divertido porque ese nosotros no somos otra cosa que inmigrantes es decir ciudadanos de segunda clase
2136617 certainly the electronic kers were looking at is a fully sealed unit all the high tension cables are within a sealed unit its difficult to see how you can have a problem
2136618 depuis son election il ny a pas eu d meutes
2136619 ya de la joie bonjour bonjour les hirondelles ya de la joie
2136620 sir looks like weve been hit pretty bad i have to go will try to reach you via cell as possible
2136621 will take your folks get them out of the building and to safety
2136622 aye sir are you sure theres nothing we can do here
2136623 no get them out and stand by ive got a bad feeling about the command center
2136624 our penal code and criminal procedure code originate from the common law
2136625 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any power on earth to criticise another countrys internal administration of justice
2136626 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2136627 weve had enough of this criticism but if they have a substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2136628 we have been summoning people too often lately i think for now we just let this go
2136629 as the minister of foreign affairs i would like to send this message loud and clear stop meddling in our internal affairs
2136630 we can say the same thing about guantanamo we can say about the malaysians being detained there but we did not do that as we have respect for the systems of the world
2136631 what more with the creation of the asean charter we want to ensure a much brighter future for asean whether in the political economic security or socio cultural sphere
2136632 why did i mention sept 16 in the first place thats the reason theyre hell bent on attacking me yes but i cannot state the numbers because the understanding is i will only announce names and numbers when they declare it may be on aug 27 or even before that or a bit later
2136633 the range is comfortable with the possibility of forming the government i will say we will have adequate numbers
2136634 okay it may not happen if a calamity like an earthquake happens twenty days is enough according to winston churchill one week in politics is a long time as you have seen the past week has been a helluva long time for me but i dont think i can convince abdullah and syed hamid for now
2136635 i am headed there tomorrow but all the hotels have already been booked by puteri umno and other wings
2136636 i would be surprised if mca mic and gerakan will go gung ho knowing the issue being played by umno is purely one of malay supremacy
2136637 there may be plants by umno so as to cause a split in the votes but i dont think it will be effective
2136638 we have to acknowledge that we are dealing with a desperate leadership in umno bn
2136639 this is our new platform if they say because of my criticism of abuse of the nep by a few leaders enriching themselves with billions at the expense of poor malays that it is an affront to malays i leave it to malays to decide
2136640 it shatters lingering doubts of whether the alleged act ever took place his dr mohamed osman statement confirms what we have already stated as deplorable actions by police to fabricate evidence identical to my case in 1998
2136641 i am distraught that the mainstream media did not focus or cover this and the home minister did not respond to this this is a serious allegation of fabricated evidence signed under oath
2136642 the prime minister says it is rape it is very serious that the police have evidence and he should be charged but he is not the a g
2136643 i acknowledge syed hamid repeatedly saying that anwar is innocent until proven guilty but he should advise the pm on this elementary principle in law but it is still not for him to decide who should or should not be charged
2136644 this one i think is going to be bigger and more spectacular not necessarily more surprising but more impressive i think than any previous ceremony
2136645 its inevitable that people from different countries may not see eye to eye
2136646 so we should try to expand our common ground on the basis of mutual respect
2136647 they want those leaders to confirm the fact that china has returned to great power prominence in the world
2136648 they really want to say to the people of china that we the communist party of china have done a great job
2136649 mrs peterson from ipswich has just saved ten souls with her donation
2136650 this is my first billion and i speak to it
2136651 this is my first billion and i speak to it
2136652 all people should have the freedom to say what they think and worship as they choose
2136653 america will continue to support china on the path toward a free economy
2136654 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists
2136655 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
2136656 and we press for openness and justice not to impose our beliefs but to allow the chinese people to express theirs
2136657 has placed america in a better position to be honest and direct on other issues
2136658 we firmly oppose any statements or deeds which use human rights religion and other issues to interfere with the internal affairs of other countries
2136659 maintaining and promoting basic rights and freedom of its citizens
2136660 chinese citizens enjoy freedom of religion in accordance with the law these facts are well known regarding the sino u s differences on issues including human rights and religion we have always insisted on dialogue and communication based on mutual equality and mutual respect in order to enhance understanding reduce differences and to expand consensus
2136661 we were disturbed to learn that the chinese had refused his visa we are taking the matter very seriously
2136662 tibetans are continuing to come in front of the embassy and they are being arrested
2136663 we are planning to conduct a full and thorough investigation
2136664 inadvertently killing four women and a child located with them
2136665 painful taxes hard choices for your budget not ready to lead thats the real obama
2136666 enormous disappointment when you lose without playing to your capabilities
2136667 firstly we didnt handle the physical intensity that the all blacks brought to the game as well as wed have liked
2136668 perhaps it was the fact that we were playing our third test match in as many weeks which is difficult although not insurmountable maybe some of the players relaxed just a little bit failing to appreciate that the all blacks would come at them even more strongly in light of their setback in the first game
2136669 crux of the matter was the contest in the contact zone around the breakdown
2136670 there the all blacks generally won the battle and physically imposed themselves as we had on them the week before at anz stadium
2136671 we were hesitant at times and forced into taking poor options which in turn increased the pressure that we were under as a consequence we were unable to build any consistent pressure through continuity of possession or field position and you simply cant get away with that against the best teams they will capitalise and the all blacks did
2136672 i would like to think the reverse wont impact too greatly on the confidence that has been built up within the group but that is something well really only be able to judge retrospectively
2136673 as the players recharge their batteries they will be able to reflect on an opening six tests that have generally gone well
2136674 encouragingly that showed through even under duress in auckland where the players showed that they were still prepared to try things and still prepared to back themselves and play it didnt always come off but the approach said a lot about their positive attitude
2136675 as a student of human rights in china since my university days i believe it is always a combination of private diplomacy as well as periodic public reminders
2136676 but lets be frank about where changes need to occur in human rights terms
2136677 i believe in my own dealings we need to engage with them respectfully and clearly this complex challenge doesnt lend itself to being neatly characterised we have to recognise progress where its occurred but also recognise where progress still has to occur
2136678 its tough its hard and its difficult but when i look back to the china of 1976 the china of 89 with tiananmen and what has happened since there has been significant progress but much much more progress needs to occur
2136679 lu kewen kevin rudds name in chinese let me welcome you to beijing i wish the australian athletes a very good performance during the games
2136680 this year after the devastating earthquake you wrote a personal letter to me expressing your sympathies and those of the australian government and offered support we are deeply appreciative of this
2136681 i think its time to move forward to take decisive action
2136682 i was definitely passionate and very assertive verbally in saying it was a raping of the earth and ruining of the wetlands i said i want to see whats under the tarp i wanted to tell the three guys they were killing animals and plants so i did
2136683 ballona institutes activities have been determined to be incompatible with the departments management goals and objectives
2136684 deprives the plants underneath of sunlight so no photosynthesis or reproduction occurs
2136685 we want people to change their behavior and use more water efficient products for landscaping
2136686 it never occurred to me that in a state that has an extreme water shortage every city wouldnt do everything they possibly could to save water
2136687 ill go ahead and take the state and national level i know some people on the city council here
2136688 turf or acceptable dry climate ground cover is allowed in the frontyard
2136689 the government has known about the problem since the 1980s
2136690 the river is a mess it is a national disgrace they blame global warming and everything else but they do nothing
2136691 we havent had floods since the 1970s not a decent one i am angry about this river and what has happened to it it was a beautiful river and now it is a hazard
2136692 they would swing ropes into the river go canoeing fishing catch yabbies
2136693 this was a magic place now theres nothing when the kids come back with their kids they dont catch anything
2136694 this is quite a natural stoppage this is one of the events where there is a lack of rain
2136695 but with the advent of irrigation on this river we are amplifying the drought these are the worst conditions i have ever seen
2136696 ecologically it is doing a lot of damage within the flood plains billabongs creeks and flood runs
2136697 they allocated more water than it is possible to take out of the system
2136698 we have 15 000 hectares of irrigated wheat in that looks absolutely magnificent we often get tagged as just being a cotton operation well we are not
2136699 this year we have grown sorghum sunflowers wheat we will be growing some cotton at the end of the year and it is highly likely we will grow some soybeans during summer
2136700 torear a mi aire ojal entren al trapo los enemigos sin ellos me quedo en nada
2136701 they are overwhelmingly bought by women who gorge on the details like famished dogs on a bone
2136702 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
2136703 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient
2136704 bank customers frequently and incorrectly equate significant drops in bank stock prices with safety of bank deposits
2136705 at a time when the economy is clearly under stress the commission has a responsibility to assure that destructive practices such as abusive naked short selling are stopped
2136706 the red petrol card might mesmerize my more gullible audiences but the black bling always gets them to spend
2136707 the general aim is to improve on your personal best break the philippine record if you can the sea games record and take it from there
2136708 my goal now is to be mentally and physically prepared because i will be up against the sharp shooters of the world
2136709 los dem cratas est n en las nubes pensando en las posibilidades que tienen en noviembre
2136710 tras dos elecciones presidenciales muy ajustadas no es realista el esperar un gran cambio
2136711 la imagen de independiente de mccain y su habilidad para atraer a los votantes independientes hace que esta sea una carrera re ida
2136712 las encuestas se hacen entre posibles votantes y se tiene en cuenta la participaci n en a os previos con lo que si es verdad que obama atraer como dicen a nuevos votantes esos no estar an reflejados en los sondeos
2136713 la gente todav a no ha tomado una decisi n y lo que pasa en julio o agosto no es definitivo
2136714 when you come in at 500 600 mph drop a 500 pound bomb and then fly away you dont see what happens
2136715 you watch it all the way to impact and i mean its very vivid its right there and personal so it does stay in peoples minds for a long time
2136716 they look like they broke off from a word or got lost or had some other accident
2136717 one little letter had to represent an important word but it was too wimpy graphically speaking to carry the semantic burden so the scribes made it bigger which means taller which means equivalent to a capital
2136718 theyre going to push each other and really help make something special
2136719 were gonna be doing one thing and one thing only and thats killing nazis
2136720 ainda estamos come ando a falar disso mas h setores da economia iraniana vulner veis a san es direcionadas por exemplo o setor de gnl g s natural liquefeito de investimento em g s e petr leo de produtos finos importados de resseguro entre outros
2136721 n s poder amos avaliar essas reas caso desejemos aumentar as press es sobre a lideran a iraniana
2136722 v rios outros pa ses que gostariam de participar dessas discuss es medida que continuarmos avan ando
2136723 houve uma negocia o mas n o se conseguiu obter resultado eles fizeram dois ref ns amea aram com armas e devido a isso a pol cia teve de intervir
2136724 that was not a threatening gesture it was only a start of surprise i was astonished to see him in baghdad for i had an appointment with him tonight in samarra
2136725 in the 1960s a mafia don was only as strong as his family
2136726 we found the hierarchical culture of organized crime intriguing running an organized crime family in a world defined by family loyalty is something that we felt could introduce a new strategic element to the genre that is what the dons view is all about laying out a strategy to pick off the competition one by one the dons view is so unique it could fundamentally change the rules of open world games by blending action and strategy to create something entirely new
2136727 the godfather has become an exceptional gaming franchise for the studio
2136728 the videogame takes the story and gameplay to the next level with an innovative open world action strategy that is both compelling and intriguing for gamers
2136729 we have to ensure that the peripheral strategy that anyone employs makes sense and delivers a truly game changing experience
2136730 because if its just okay it will end up in the cupboard under the stairs
2136731 if you look at what people dont like about existing karaoke games its that youve got wired microphones which look like theyve come out of a toy shop and a fairly restricted song base
2136732 when we designed lips we looked at those two major barriers we created the wireless mics which look and feel like real microphones have motion sensors so you have more opportunity to get fun out of it because you can use it as a percussion instrument and even light up
2136733 regarding brian he recently resigned to form a startup technology company outside the game industry which is why weve posted about the open position this change wont impact the game
2136734 the amount being paid to the music industry even though their games are entirely dependent on the content we own and control is far too small
2136735 version 1 1 not only includes a host of play balancing changes but new content such as an updated graphics engine updated visuals new damage animations and more
2136736 to minimize the excessive use by contractors of subcontractors or tiers of subcontractors to perform the principal work of the contract
2136737 a cabinet established through such an avenue will lack moral credibility parliament itself will be tarnished both the executive and the legislature two vital arms of governance will be perceived by the people as institutions that are bereft of integrity
2136738 the size and scale of the crossover he envisages is mind boggling has there ever been an instance anywhere in the world where a government which has 58 seats more than the combined opposition is under the constant threat of imminent collapse simply because an individual who is not even in parliament boasts continuously that a certain number of mps are going to switch sides by a certain date
2136739 if the threat of crossovers hangs like a sword of damocles over the nations head it is partly because many malaysians know that anwar as a bn and federal government leader at one time had played a pivotal role in the overthrow of the democratically elected pbs state government in sabah in 1994
2136740 in a democracy a legislator elected on a particular platform should return his mandate to the people and resign his seat before he switches sides that is what respect for the dignity of the voter means
2136741 they should have tried to convince him that it is more honourable to enter putrajaya through the front door this implies winning the 13th general election at the federal level and forming the government through legitimate ethical means
2136742 one hopes that he will also as the leader of the opposition establish a shadow cabinet that cajoles and coaxes the bn government to introduce much needed changes
2136743 i would personally advise that if they were to proceed at least at this stage to allay fears of others have a closed door forum deal with it then engage with the rest particularly those who have expressed concerns
2136744 my position has always been that you should always have an open attitude in giving democratic space
2136745 but there are now sensitivities raised so whether it is effective if you have an open forum and seen to be too provocative or have a more closed door affair so discussions can take place without being seen as too provocative
2136746 yes i was criticised asking why it was necessary but i said at least it allowed people to express themselves and allay fears anxieties and insecurities that religious beliefs are being maligned
2136747 i may not share that view but there is a concern expressed and people are genuinely worried i think for the sake of a multiracial and religious malaysia we should be mindful of this continue discussions engage with those who are concerned allay the fears and move on
2136748 i think this strategy would be more effective in the medium and long term when going head on with an issue which is particularly sensitive
2136749 it didnt happen so im not interested but charge him in the syariah court i have lodge a report for false accusation
2136750 this will be the last case of such cruelty after this i will take action against anyone who tries such a thing
2136751 but its not up to dollah badawi to decide who can represent the people but the voters themselves
2136752 one day he says it is rape the next its not it changes according to his fancy how shameful
2136753 investors are scared to invest in a country with a correct correct correct judiciary
2136754 where there are reports of corruption against the prime minister and his deputy by their own party members
2136755 yes i am a chinese tool i am an indian tool i am a malay tool i am a tool of all malaysians
2136756 not only because i dont have the money to compete with bn but these donors will each become stakeholders in the campaign to take over putrajaya
2136757 this is not just about winning one seat it is a symbol for change
2136758 we will also have a team that will be checking for phantom voters and also to ensure that voters make it to polling centres we know of a stealth campaign by bn to tell voters not to turn up as the majority is already so great that it would not make a difference this is a dangerous propaganda coupled with the decision to set the polling day for tuesday a working day

2136772 we are here because china is the main supporter of the military regime
2136773 we want the chinese government to understand the actual cost of their support to the people inside of burma
2136774 china can help our democratization process by putting pressure on the military regime
2136775 we will never forget we will never give up 1988
2136776 ive totally lost hope that change will come through mass protests
2136777 its difficult to organize protests now because most of the leaders are in jail or in hiding
2136778 i cannot participate the way i did in 1988 i am older now and have a family to take care of
2136779 those were the days and i dont expect demonstrations of that scale to ever take place again in the country
2136780 a lot of people are saying what has gone wrong
2136781 as the world celebrates the opening of the beijing olympics people should pause to remember the atrocities in burma 20 years ago
2136782 this anniversary is testament to the burmese peoples enduring demand for freedom and to the worlds failure to end repressive military rule

2136792 i cheated on you because you didnt buy me a new cadillac
2136793 i think we could have avoided at least some of this if we had agreed to do the town hall meetings
2136794 i cheated on you because you didnt buy me what i wanted
2136795 i acted like an amoral person because i didnt get what i want
2136796 i think the notion that somehow as a consequence of not having joint appearances senator mccain felt obliged to suggest that id rather lose a war to win a campaign doesnt automatically follow i think we each have control over ourselves and our campaigns and we have to take responsibility for that

2136800 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2136801 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2136802 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2136803 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2136804 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2136805 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2136806 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2136807 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2136808 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2136809 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2136810 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2136811 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

2136820 we may be unable to compete effectively within the highly competitive software industry
2136821 we may also face increasing competition from open source software initiatives in which competitors may provide software and intellectual property for free existing or new competitors could gain sales opportunities or customers at our expense
2136822 we may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully
2136823 the increase in open source software distribution may also cause us to change our pricing models
2136824 the company continues to be a leading force in open source solutions to enable its clients to achieve higher levels of interoperability cost efficiency and quality

2136886 leuro forte e il dollaro debole fanno s che i prodotti europei compresi quelli italiani sono un po pi difficili da introdurre escludendo lalta tecnologia che viaggia al di fuori di un concetto puramente basato sui prezzi oggi si sta assistendo a una corrente di esportazione di prodotti non soltanto primari verso leuropa i prodotti che i paesi in sud america produciamo vanno a ruba sia in europa e anche in italia per si stanno verificando in europa grossi investimenti in settori che non sono quelli che producono commodities che esportano in europa come la carne la lana i cereali ma oggi si stanno verificando investimenti europei non indifferenti in altri campi come ad esempio in uruguay nel campo del legno da parte di finlandesi spagnoli e perfino portoghesi stanno facendo degli investimenti di migliaia di euro non solo nella materia prima il legno appunto ma anche nella produzione di pasta di cellulosa o addirittura di carta in secondo luogo gli europei stanno investendo in attivit di logistica nei trasporti il messaggio che stiamo trasmettendo che in questo paese ci sono delle grandi opportunit di affari nei nostri paesi qui la terra costa poco e meno che in europa la manodopera si trova qualificata pur costando di meno le leggi che proteggono gli investimenti esteri sono molto favorevoli per gli investitori qui non c una differenza tra capitale locale e capitale estero si pu introdurre ed esportare liberamente non solo capitali ma anche dividendi ad esempio nel campo del legno il primo taglio delleucaliptus avviene in sette otto anni contro il doppio in europa e queste differenze attraggono investimenti importanti da parte delleuropa

2136921 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2136922 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2136923 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2136924 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

2136940 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2136941 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2136942 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2136943 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2136944 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2136945 the conditions were much tougher than i expected this morning so i was happy that i was still able to go out and put together a decent score
2136946 the putter was the key to the round i putted pretty well yesterday but the greens were spiked up so i was excited about what i would be able to do in fresher conditions today
2136947 you never know you might shoot an 8 over and it comes down to sunday and you can still have a chance to win
2136948 the course is playing a lot harder today than yesterday
2136949 the winds a lot harder i know the guys playing in the afternoon its going to be very challenging for them
2136950 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2136951 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2136952 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2136953 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2136954 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2136955 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2136956 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2136957 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2136958 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2136959 today the olympic flame lit in olympia has come to the end of its odyssey and will be kindled to adorn the night sky of beijing
2136960 you have chosen as the theme of these games one world one dream
2136961 as one world we grieved with you over the tragic earthquake in sichuan province
2136962 for a long time china had dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games tonight that dream comes true congratulations beijing
2136963 this is a job 100 times more demanding than directing a blockbuster movie because im responsible for celebrating the realization of a century old dream and showcasing a 5 000 year civilization
2136964 i love it it combines the chinese ancient history with the modern high technology
2136965 for dreams we travel thousands of miles we meet in beijing you and me from one world forever we are one family
2136966 it is a great thing that our country is hosting the olympic games which shows china is growing more and more strong

2136969 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2136970 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2136971 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2136972 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2136973 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2136974 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2136975 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2136976 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2136977 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2136978 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

2136980 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

2137020 never mind the true story that inspired it bottle shock is a jingoistic light drama so crude and clueless it flirts with outright racism
2137021 in august of 1974 a redheaded frenchman with the perfectly precious nom de cirque philippe petit along with a crew of coconspirators sneaked into the newly erected world trade center smuggled cables and equipment up to the unoccupied top floors strung a tightrope from the roof of one tower to its twin in the dead of night and then walked and knelt and saluted and lay supine between them for the better part of a morning hour the feat sounds impressive on paper but until you see this documentary you wont realize how hushed and beautiful the performance was how completely it dazzled passersby and police
2137022 boy a has an exquisitely melancholy mood a dark brooding and a bruised sweetness if it sounds like a drag thats because it is but its a pleasant aching drag
2137023 the combination of horror and emo speak may sound precious but it works like a champion here with each element somehow diffusing and enriching the other after the first few genuine scares whenever the handheld camera drunkenly moves towards a window during the middle of a fumbling conversation its difficult not to shudder on levels both ironic and otherwise those expecting a gorefest will most likely walk away perplexed but viewers able to latch onto its wobbly wavelength will have a blast
2137024 in contrast to the book which is told in the first person and explicitly concerns the impact of the sexual revolution on an essentially conservative man born in 1930 the film does very little to get inside the head of its protagonist were left to wonder uncomfortably whether consuela is indeed as one dimensional as she seems or if the professor is pressing her flat with the iron of his enormous ego theres no point dwelling on the problem between the ugly digital photography the repellent characters and the free floating misogyny elegy is an unpleasant film

2137061 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2137062 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package

2137362 stepped down monday after an internet newsletter wrote about his brief stint on the funds board which also included a fundamentalist imam
2137363 in 2000 mr asbahi briefly served on the board of allied assets advisors fund a delaware registered trust its other board members at the time included jamal said the imam at a fundamentalist controlled mosque in illinois
2137364 other web sites some pro republican and others critical of fundamentalist islam also have reported on the background of mr asbahi he is a frequent speaker before several groups in the u s that scholars have associated with the muslim brotherhood
2137365 the justice department named mr said an unindicted co conspirator in the racketeering trial last year of several alleged hamas fund raisers which ended in a mistrial he has also been identified as a leading member of the group in news reports going back to 1993

2137376 its been just once maybe twice weve given him enough runs where he can coast weve just got to continue to add on offensively we had opportunities to add on during the course of that game so i dont think this ones on the bullpen this ones more on the offense weve got to go out there and drive in some runs
2137377 i used most of what i have to reach it
2137378 i am fully confident that if i am given the ball in those situations when billys out that i can get the job done
2137379 but im not a closer and thats reality neither is anyone else in here we have one closer and hes hurt as a bullpen weve struggled but were the same guys that threw up 23 scoreless innings what 10 days ago
2137380 lately weve just had a real problem of keeping the ball in the park no matter who it is out there we seem to give up a lot of home runs its a good thing were going to eventually figure it out

2137388 while foreign investors bring about leading skills in design and the building of structures much of the supporting skills must be borne by the local population

2137404 from the fact check desk are obamas claims about inflating car tires accurate
2137405 it means that if every american was running around with significantly underinflated tires and improperly tuned cars then yes sen obama is right the savings from inflating the tires and tuning the cars could arguably match or exceed current output from the ocs however since estimates of significant tire underinflation affect only about a quarter of the cars on road as we noted above with the nhtsa statistics and its highly unlikely that 100 of the cars are in need of tune ups at any given time the maximum savings amount is probably closer to 10

2137515 one of the reasons i call the album the declaration is because i feel its important to present all sides of what being a woman is about
2137516 historically weve always been relegated to the bottom of the totem pole whether its business or the battle of the sexes or just empowering each other i want this album to make people feel stronger about themselves ive always used the ups and downs in my own life as a motivational tool and i hope my music comes off that way i felt a lot of passion making this record i loved every minute i was in the studio
2137517 id hate to empower our customers to complain because there is a lot of things we do wrong that they could complain about and opening that dialog up to the public could be dangerous risky to say the least
2137518 openly discuss and share the very issues that ingrained bureaucracy has caused
2137519 that may sound harsh but hidebound behavior is a business killer damages how about deadens thats a better word to describe what bureaucracy does it sucks the life out of a business it turns normal people granted a smidgen of authority into rule bound technocrats and twists candid conversation about real issues into jargon laden gobbledygook in short bureaucracy gums up the works its a competitiveness killer
2137520 and yet for all its destructive power and in spite of all the people who claim to abhor it bureaucracy almost never gets the kind of fight back it deserves most people simply suffer through it
2137521 so why do people put up with it probably because bureaucracy just seems like too big a monster for any one individual to slay and wed agree unless that individual happens to be the leader after all it is leaders who set the tone for their organizations through the values they choose and the behaviors they demonstrate and ultimately it is leaders and leaders alone who have the power to set a bureaucracy eradication process in motion
2137522 if youre a business leader you cant surrender to the status quo either true you will never be able to eliminate every vestige of deadening bureaucracy but try like crazy anyway the upside is huge all it takes is courage

2137531 i could sense the tension the apprehension and the excitement
2137532 you could tell the guys i honestly felt like they were stallions at the gate waiting for the gate to open so they could run so it was pretty cool to see these guys were ready to get out there
2137533 kind of like the breakthrough series heres another way that your hard work can pay dividends
2137534 also it marries the programs rbi and the academy when the academy was built we were designed as the brick and mortar testament to what major league baseballs commitment was to the youth of america theres synergy were able to link our efforts and be able to serve the youth of america
2137535 we have similar missions and a lot of the kids that we both serve rbi helps and we help too its us its not me its us its we its not i its a we i think thats the great thing that everyone can see that we are both successfully running work together
2137536 to the student athletes who are getting the scholarship it means a whole lot education is very expensive today and we hope it gives them a jump start on their educational experience i hope the major league ballplayers drive in a lot of rbis
2137537 compared to the fields we play on in jersey city its amazing
2137538 its a great experience because a lot of these kids dont get an opportunity to travel
2137539 they get a chance to travel and get a chance to see all the kids with the same ability and see what the world series is all about weve got philadelphia weve got detroit weve got minnesota weve got houston l a so weve got some of the major cities involved in the world series
2137540 people put some hard work into getting all this stuff put together im waiting for this game to get over so i can get out on the field and play im ready to win
2137541 its the perfect event to be able to do a lot of great things i think thats what makes the rbi world series special because its not just a showcase its not just a this its not just a that its not just a social interaction its a little bit of everything thats why this has been a fun event and it always is a fun event too
2137542 i hope that our unique plan to save the others will mean a lifeline for the threatened branches im pleased for spotland road but feel for the others
2137543 it is my view that the consultation team ignored the arguments we set out for all intents and purposes many of the decisions that the team made were a sham they had already made their minds up
2137544 at first i couldnt grasp that i am on the course this september its only a month away im ecstatic this shows people that determination and perseverance do pay off and if you think you have been mistreated by a university you should fight your cause
2137545 now i see my future going somewhere i just cant wait to be at medical school
2137546 universities should not turn away talented individuals who have successfully rehabilitated when their convictions are spent or when they have made positive steps to change their lives and improve their futures
2137547 humanity is what you lose while youre busy making plans to gain power
2137548 it does seem to be stalling people stamp duty can be a big chunk of money and finding an extra 1 500 can be hard and very off putting for some its worth waiting for a chance not to pay it
2137549 its not normally a deal breaker so people who have seen a property they love and want to buy are going ahead with it others are putting in an offer but stalling the exchange of contracts which causes deals in a chain to fall through its affecting about 10 per cent of customers at the moment and its likely to grow
2137550 if the government is going to mention this they should go ahead with it we want them to bring the axe down and make a decision its very important that the housing market keeps moving at the moment because 50 per cent of it has already disappeared
2137551 i cant say weve seen an effect as yet but its early days and next week we may see sales fall further
2137552 a lot of properties in this area come in below the stamp duty limit anyway so suspending stamp duty is not a panacea you can say every little helps but this is just the government taking baby steps
2137553 stamp duty is just another one of these stupid taxes that shouldnt be there after all what do you get for paying this tax
2137554 i am sure ldg has seen this link you posted comments i hope by ldg
2137555 i think we should get our allies together to impose sanctions in iran and encourage them to change their behavior

2137559 i think ill move russell to another spot jeff certainly gave us a lift today
2137560 nothings easy the way these guys knocked us around the last couple of games but he got us back on track
2137561 today wasnt pretty but i got the job done i was kind of effectively wild
2137562 the first inning i was a little out of sync then i settled in for me to be effective i dont think i can ever pull back from anything i need to be aggressive i came back out better in the second inning thats what pitchers have to do make quick adjustments
2137563 hes growing up out there and maturing and the results are starting to come
2137564 its like somebody says something and they run like wildfire with this stuff
2137565 virtually all conventional pin tumbler locks are vulnerable to this method of attack and frankly nobody has really considered it or looked at it before
2137566 when you have a high security lock you dont expect this to be able to happen
2137567 key control is supposed to make this impossible to happen thats what youre paying for
2137568 basically weve destroyed medecos key control because we can make plastic keys for any of their m3 locks and a lot of their biaxial locks which is their last generation of locks
2137569 youre an employee and you loan it to somebody or your kid takes it off your key ring and makes a copy and tells his friends to break into the facility i can give you a lot of scenarios
2137570 if youre a security manager for the federal reserve or citibank you have a belief that what the company is telling you is true that unless its authorized nobody can reproduce your keys
2137571 so if you give a key to an employee you dont have to worry about it and thats the problem its not true
2137572 this attack you dont kneed to know what youre doing
2137573 basically if someone came to me before and said they could pick a medeco lock id say youre crazy you dont know what youre talking about if they told me they could open it with plastic the same thing id say youre crazy
2137574 locksmiths dont have a clue what is going on your locksmith will tell you this is impossible

2137618 if america stands for anything it stands for the freedom to follow our own hearts to determine our own relationship with god our constitution did not establish a national religion but neither did it banish any worship religious freedom does not require americans to hide their faith from public view or that communities must refrain from publicly acknowledging the importance to them of faith we are only abjured from using the law to make those who do not wish to adhere to the creed that we embrace judges should not legislate from the bench and actually restrict religious freedom by banning its expression in the public square
2137619 i had to have faith in something greater than myself not only to survive but to survive with my self respect intact faith in my comrades faith in my country and faith in my god that faith helped me not only to endure but to understand and respect the values it encompassed and thus in a moment of unexpected compassion that god ordained i could learn the most valuable lesson of all how to forgive and to escape the bitterness that could have destroyed my life
2137620 what was intellectual and what was emotional joined and the belief in the redemptive power of jesus christ that he died for our sins that through him we could achieve eternal life but also that through good works we could find order and meaning here on earth and transcend our limits and our flaws and our foibles i found that powerful
2137621 i let jesus christ into my life i learned that my sins could be redeemed and if i placed my trust in jesus that he could set me on a path to eternal life when i submitted myself to his will and i dedicated myself to discovering his truth and carrying out his works it was that newfound faith that fortified my commitment to the work i was doing in the community because it taught me that i could sit in church and pray all i want but i wont be fulfilling the lords will unless i am doing the lords work

2137668 we believe the bank of england really had little option but to keep interest rates at 5 00 percent
2137669 the ever growing likelihood of recession calls for lower interest rates yet this is precluded by elevated inflation levels and risks
2137670 all eyes will now be on next weeks inflation report for clues about the near term policy path
2137671 we expect a set of forecasts consistent with rates remaining on hold for the time being reflecting a very concerning near term inflation outlook and the risk that this may lead to second round effects on wages and prices
2137672 the monetary policy committee avoided the temptation to tighten policy at this months meeting
2137673 one question we are mulling is the closeness of the vote and whether there is still a significant danger of the committee raising rates especially as our forecasts show inflation at 5 0 percent in september
2137674 the latest data show the slowdown in uk economic activity gathering pace and business and consumer confidence falling further
2137675 however with inflation heading higher in the next couple of months the bank is right to leave rates on hold for the time being

2137681 although i take some comfort from our relative performance in managing our risks and in generating income a decline in pre tax profit of 33 percent is acutely disappointing
2137682 we have experienced significant writedowns it would be wrong in this review to suggest that the market conditions over the foreseeable future will be anything other than tough not least because we are now seeing the impact of slowing economies around the world and that means that we must remain very vigilant to managing risk

2137718 la lecci n de los ltimos 50 a os es que cuando la inflaci n echa ra ces el costo de controlarla en el futuro se refleja en un per odo prolongado de bajo crecimiento y alto desempleo
2137719 los precios suben dejando menos recursos para ser gastados en otros bienes y servicios
2137720 esto ha afectado la demanda y la producci n de algunos productos especialmente los industriales y los servicios la disminuci n en la demanda por este motivo ha generado una reducci n en el consumo de las familias superior a la que se produce por el encarecimiento del cr dito
2137721 muchas de estas materias primas tienen un impacto fuerte en los costos de producci n de algunos sectores productivos las presiones de costos de las empresas implican recortes en sus m rgenes de ganancia y desestimulan la producci n
2137722 de esa manera se evita que un fen meno que ahora tiene un componente externo y localizado se convierta en una inflaci n generalizada e interna

2137746 i am in love with this product it goes on so smooth never leaves your face feeling sticky or greasy absorbs into your skin immediately and leaves your skin looking radiant and flawless i cant say enough about how good this product is for your skin its a must for any skin that is maturing i didnt realize how great it was working until i switched brands for a few months to try something new in just a few weeks my skin started getting splotchy and not nearly as smooth as it was when i was using this product daily
2137747 i have been using this product for about two months its probably the best facial serum you can purchase at a drugstore for anti aging benefits my two sun spots one on each cheek seem to have faded somewhat and my facial skin feels really soft and smooth of course you need to use this product along with a daily moisturizer with a minimum spf of 15 and eye cream
2137748 i read that this is madonnas skin care choice it is a great product i like that it is natural and contains grape seed extract which i think is the ingredient that really makes my skin glow the serum feels light and yet leaves you moisturized to the hilt i cant afford it all the time but i found this is one investment that lives up to its claims
2137749 i have tried several line smoothers more than i care to count and so far genie instant line smoother is the best out there the only drawback is that you have to apply every day but who cares it really works if you worry about any lines wrinkles and dont want to go the surgery route use genie it will not let you down and takes years off your face and neck
2137750 i did not expect to see results so fast but after using this wonderful product the very first time i was impressed my skin was firmer in just five minutes and it only gets better with repeated use i know that i am gushing here but you really have to try it for yourself and see the results it smells like pineapple and you can feel it tightening as it dries unlike other products that claim to reduce wrinkles this product does not leave any white flakes on your skin and can be used under makeup great product
2137751 amorepacific is a leader in anti aging skin care i had heard a lot about it but didnt believe it until i actually tried it the time response collection will actually reverse aging with powerful green tea egcg korean red ginseng and stabilized bamboo sap in place of water the ingredients alone will immediately tighten and firm your skin but if you use this ampoule system you can completely resurface your skin in one months time this is perfect if you have a wedding or special event to go to and you want to look absolutely flawless if you want to lighten dark spots tighten pores reduce redness and lift firm and tone your skin all you need to do is try this system i made the investment and my skin thanks me every day
2137752 i just started using this product a few weeks ago and ive already noticed a difference my face is softer smoother and more radiant i put a bit around my eyes and mouth every morning and night someone recently told me that my face was glowing cant wait to see how my skin will look after using it for several months
2137753 i have combination skin and usually break out from a cream however the other serums i have tried are either sticky smelly or feel filmy after application this product does not i bought a few bottles and i like it as much now as when i started my skin is definitely firmer and the reduction in breakouts is a big plus for me im in my mid 30s the only thing is youll have to get spf from somewhere else personally i use an anti aging foundation with spf 20 but for 15 this serum cant be beat
2137754 it is rather expensive isnt it ask for a sample to try first im allergic to a lot of products so i try to do this to alleviate returns this is very easy to apply goes on smoothly and let me tell you wow if i saw a difference after two days anyone will now im off to kiss the virtual feet of the dior research and development crew who created this
2137755 i am only 28 years old and didnt think my skin was that bad until i tried this elixir by avon the first time i used it i could tell that my skin was more luminous after two weeks i could not believe how perfect my skin was i have no visible pores no frown lines just healthy beautiful skin that really glows this is no lie ladies go get you some

2137899 i dont expect anything but for him to be the pro that he is
2137900 he can provide us some defensive stability and he can give us some speed on the bases
2137901 it makes me focus a little harder but im not going to change the way i go about my daily preparations
2137902 he gives us a very different look from what we currently have hes an extreme ground ball pitcher that should enjoy a lot of success pitching in front of our infield defense
2137903 its a very interesting acquisition you look at this guys ground ball ratio its the highest i believe in all of baseball right now really a durable kind of guy primarily the kind of guy who gets a righty out but there are lefties he matches up against hes been very successful in the postseason and ive heard hes a great guy a very positive addition for us
2137904 my thought is hes a ground ball machine thats what he is
2137905 and hes the kind of guy you put in the game to roll one over and try and get a double play
2137906 i definitely think hes going to help no question different look hes all the way down almost like a softball pitcher he comes in he throws strikes which is huge makes them put the ball in play the great thing about that is we have a great defense thats going to work behind him and im looking forward to seeing what he can do to help us out here

2137961 glass was around me and all but the only thing i was doing was praying
2137962 the most important thing is im not hurt but it was very scary the impact of the tree hitting the truck
2137963 we went inside to the store because we were afraid
2137964 its a very large operation essentially what were now doing is damage assessment
2137965 obama attacking pro mccain group gets free trip to iraq
2137966 but what about sending political activists and gop operatives to iraq in the guise of journalists with the cooperation of the u s military and on the taxpayers dime so that the activists can come home and proselytize for the republican presidential candidates position on the war
2137967 its essential for the american people to know the facts about what is happening in iraq some media and certain politicians still fail to assess the situation objectively so vets for freedom is heading back to iraq to let the american people and key lawmakers know what has been accomplished what still needs to be done and how we should proceed in order to attain sustainable security in iraq
2137968 proselytizing for the republican presidential candidates position on the war
2137969 nonpartisan patriotism is the common thread tying together these reflections love letters and stories of combat they make for riveting reading
2137970 this collection is an excellent introduction to an emerging form of war reporting
2137971 there is much to tell and celebrate in the tough day to day work that our soldiers are doing in one of the most challenging environments any army has ever faced
2137972 we got casey blake to play third base we added veterans in the bullpen jason johnson and brian falkenborg who have been around a bit obviously we have manny for a handful of days
2137973 not only that weve had progress with the kids and you expect that with the experience they are getting over a full season and the learning that comes with failure we have a new hitting coach in don mattingly we had takashi saito go down but jonathan broxton has stepped right in without a hiccup were making a push
2137974 it makes for a more formidable lineup at the top at the middle and at the bottom
2137975 we have a better chance to score when we can attack from different angles
2137976 you expect that of the kids with the opportunities theyve had
2137977 you look at matt kemp hes swinging the bat well after being an easy out at the beginning of the year hes become more patient andre ethier is a solid hitter instead of the two rookie third basemen weve added blake and russell martin is holding his own and done a good job everybody has gained some experience and thats what you hope will happen as you get close to the end of the season
2137978 he mixed them up really well they hit a bunch of balls at people
2137979 but for the most part i felt like i had my pitches working
2137980 its really a pleasure to see him pitch well the past two starts
2137981 he threw a great game tonight hes going to have his ups and downs but he was consistent tonight he was consistently throwing strikes
2137982 its helped me with my focus and lightened the load a little bit
2137983 thats one of my all time pet peeves but before i could yell at him it was too late
2137984 but i also know that im capable of pitching badly it can change in a heartbeat
2137985 the internet though far less costly than television has become a major marketing tool of food companies that target children and adolescents with more than two thirds of the 44 companies reporting online youth directed activities
2137986 this study confirms what i have been saying for years industry needs to step up to the plate and use their innovation and creativity to market healthy foods to our kids
2137987 that 1 6 billion could be used to attract our kids to healthy snacks tasty cereals fruits and vegetables
2137988 its a long season in pittsburgh like i said you go out there and you play baseball because thats what you do but in pittsburgh its been that way the last few years for no lack of trying it just didnt work out all that well it does make it a little longer than normal but thats part of baseball not everyone can be a part of this atmosphere all the time
2137989 hed play every night and he was just a clutch hitter
2137990 i just look at it as they traded manny and they needed a left fielder thats the way i look at it
2137991 somebody had to come play after him and im kind of glad it was me
2137992 there was going to be a time when we had someone other than manny ramirez in left field
2137993 realistically that time was probably going to be 2009 at the latest
2137994 you look out there there arent too many guys who are going to be available this winter who fit that description jason was very much at the top of the list when it comes to who could have possibly been our left fielder in 2009 and conceivably going forward from there to make this transaction from a difficult starting point and end up with jason as our left fielder and have him on a good contract through next year we think is a very good outcome
2137995 thats what you play baseball for i enjoyed my time in pittsburgh but the atmosphere here and the chance to win a ring makes it special
2137996 i think he has a real good understanding of trying to be himself not somebody else
2137997 hes reacted real well im glad he got some hits when he first got here because im sure it helped him relax
2137998 when youre out of it in may and in pittsburgh youre usually out of it in may what are you playing for really youre playing for your stats youre playing for your salary youre playing to just kind of get through the season its a grind when i got traded to detroit i realized the magnitude of all the games its fun because every game mattered you were able to keep your focus the rest of the season because everything really mattered i think j bay felt that when he got over here
2137999 you go from more of a laid back atmosphere to at least for myself a playoff atmosphere
2138000 you look around and nobody is counting on you to be that guy youre just a complementary piece to that puzzle theres some relaxation that comes from that ever since ive been there i have two guys on base every second or third time i get up there thats a testament to the lineup
2138001 red sox fans are definitely loud and proud for good reason
2138002 todd said buddy indicated straight up buddy said he signaled two but you dont signal two like this
2138003 we took iguchi out for the pinch hitter edgar hit in the nine hole edgar had to stay in the game we didnt have any other second baseman
2138004 he goes no and i thought you meant straight up and i have to go with what i saw
2138005 what kind of person talks about their sex and dating life on the internet someone desperate for attention or someone who already has lots of it for the microfamous having a relationship in public is as much a potential career boost as it as a vulnerability
2138006 salford has well and truly turned the corner confidence in its future is high and its reassuring that the physical aspect of regeneration is being matched by opportunities for existing residents and newcomers
2138007 we are not complacent however as there is still much to do
2138008 it will also take teamwork of the highest order and not a small element of bloody mindedness and luck
2138009 if successful we will take about five weeks to complete the climb due to the need for your body to acclimatise to this extreme environment
2138010 the risks we are facing include avalanches extreme cold wind the possibility of frostbite and only having 35 per cent of the oxygen we have at sea level
2138011 with this in mind you can really picture the scale of this challenge
2138012 i sent off the cheques straight away but then i started getting letters saying i hadnt paid the gas surcharge
2138013 i was getting very annoyed about it because i didnt know what was going to happen i sent them letters and spoke to them but i didnt get anywhere the letters i received got more and more threatening then i got a final warning
2138014 id sent the cheques by recorded delivery and had kept my bank statements so i knew i was right
2138015 but it was a very worrying time for me i didnt know if i was going to be taken to court
2138016 mr hartle left npower on march 11 he had 201 57 outstanding on his gas account and 119 89 on his electric
2138017 we sent him final bills and he forwarded two cheques for 201 and 119 which we received on may 6
2138018 both amounts were credited to the electricity account by mistake leaving the gas still unpaid on our systems when the penny drops with the great british public it will be to late we need to get out of the eu anf get control of our own utilities
2138019 these developments will strengthen our position as one of europes leading cancer centres and provide huge benefits to our patients
2138020 but they will need a significant injection of cash from our hospitals charity
2138021 we are really going to be counting on the publics support so i thought id get the ball rolling and show our supporters that we are all determined to get behind these projects
2138022 were all keen runners and have done lots of other races but this is by far the most challenging thing any of us have ever done
2138023 it is slightly daunting but were putting in lots of hard work
2138024 the thought that the run will help raise so much money is really keeping us focused through the training we cant wait to get there
2138025 we reckon the average will be at least 2 000 but we are still doing calculations
2138026 how on earth is bury council going to attract experienced and quality staff in the future when salaries are those of 10 years ago
2138027 we are going to ask for a longer period to consult
2138028 we will have to respect our members wishes as to whether they want to look at any forms of action
2138029 every council in the country must adhere to the conditions
2138030 motorists are used to the convenience of driving their own cars and are clearly prepared to pay the price however high to stay on the road and keep their freedom
2138031 petrol is seen as a commodity that people are just not prepared to give up
2138032 simple changes to the way you drive can help to save petrol and prevent your car from guzzling up your hard earned cash
2138033 i knew from the moment i hit the water id make it
2138034 to our knowledge there has been no bombing activity in iran or on its nuclear sites
2138035 its not something we have any knowledge of at this time
2138036 it is foolish to assume people will not be moving to a hybrid environment
2138037 i pack up my belongings and i head to the coast it might not be a lot but i feel like im making the most of it
2138038 just ask them or get a book on the subject
2138039 a devastating blow to the much hyped revival of atomic power has been delivered by an unlikely source the nuclear regulatory commission
2138040 japan will also increase the use of solar power tenfold by 2020 and 40 times more by 2030 while forging ahead with plans to build nine more nuclear reactors by march 2018
2138041 short sellers read barrons with special interest and they also make good sources of information that our reporters can check and publish if true
2138042 money isnt everything money is power but so is people power and i think people power is greater
2138043 aku udah janji sama ibu kalau aku akan menelepon dia bila aku jatuh cinta
2138044 she said she heard yelling in the living room of my house
2138045 she opened her door to see what was going on and at that point there was a sheriffs deputy pointing a gun at her telling her to put her hands up
2138046 its not the first time something like this has happened
2138047 were continuously trying to address the problem when people move they just use their old addresses and that throws us off their trail a little longer
2138048 the door was ajar so that told them either somebody had gone out of the house or somebody was still in the house and would not come to the door
2138049 we dont know what were confronting when we come in
2138050 was there a break in in progress when we rode up on it im sure they had their weapons out
2138051 how about if we had not checked that house somebody had broken in and attacked his daughter and he didnt find out about it until he came home
2138052 now im not trying to make excuses but thats what we have to look at all the time we have to make those decisions
2138053 make no mistake a ba aa alliance third time around plus iberia would still be bad for passengers bad for competition and bad for the uk and us aviation industry
2138054 were thrilled to welcome these two beautiful animals to our family at the baghdad zoo
2138055 the conservartors centre is proud to contribute these tigers toward the restoration of the baghdad zoo and the important education work it will engage in over the next decade
2138056 after 13 days of the us occupation we found the animals in miserable conditions
2138057 only a few of the bigger animals were still alive such as four lions and three bears
2138058 we have forgotten this matter as it is in the past and the us apologised
2138059 we did not use to come here much but after we heard that there are new animals we wanted to look around especially for our kids
2138060 we really like the tigers and we hope they will bring more
2138061 we want to be able to see the animals alive like other children around the world we want to be happy like other children
2138062 i went to the window and the hail is coming down and the rain is so hard i couldnt see anything and as i turned away from the window the whole house just shook
2138063 the roads were quite full of water down by the airborne museum it was completely covered both sides of the road
2138064 we have a nice drop in humidity and cooler temperatures coming friday
2138065 weve lived in this home for 14 years and never had any problems
2138066 my neighbor next door grabbed her hose and started to spray the top of my house to keep my house from going up
2138067 this is my personal opinion this could have been premeditated murder
2138068 the comic book a staple of british childhood for 90 years is to receive a 21st century makeover as the adventures of characters such as dennis the menace and desperate dan are sent frame by frame to childrens mobile phones
2138069 in a move that will challenge the traditional comic publishers are looking at ways of dramatically reducing costs and attracting readers by sending strips as picture messages
2138070 screen sizes are getting larger and devices like the nintendo ds and sony psp are ideal for viewing images on
2138071 the advantage of using mobile phones rather than the internet as a distribution network is that people are prepared to pay for the service
2138072 edwards is smart hes doing this on another network when everyones going to be watching the opening ceremonies
2138073 elizabeth edwards has secured a primetime speaking role at the democratic national convention john edwards as of this point does not and people close to him think he will beg off
2138074 senator obama will campaign around the country our surrogates will be active and the campaign itself will continue working with our grassroots volunteers to get our message out
2138075 of course attention will be diverted some but with only 20 days until our convention and about 90 until election day there isnt much time to lose
2138076 during the games were poised to be on the airwaves highlighting john mccains experience and proven judgment to lead
2138077 i would basically go silent for the next two weeks i think the american people have reached a saturation point with both senator obama and senator mccain
2138078 you spend some time fundraising you do not take anything away from the olympic spirit or more importantly the american athletes
2138079 senator obama and i share the goal of ensuring that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected i want to assure everyone we are working together with senator obamas campaign and the dnc and i am confident we will have a successful and unified convention in denver
2138080 i am completely committed to helping senator obama become the next president of the united states and urging all of you to do the same
2138081 i am going to continue to do whatever i can to help senator obama and democrats across the country win in the november
2138082 i have said repeatedly that i will do whatever senator obama asks me to do i am really focused and enjoying being back in the senate and working on behalf of my new york constituents this is senator obamas decision and his alone and i am going to respect the privacy of that process by not discussing it
2138083 the best senator i can be and to go on fighting every day for the issues i care about
2138084 ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party will be fully unified heading into the november election
2138085 weve been working to introduce the obamas to the american people throughout the course of the primary season and the general election and will continue to do so
2138086 voters need to get a sense of who they are as a family
2138087 i love to look glamorous when theres a wonderful purposeful event that is appropriate but when im in iowa campaigning with the girls i am in gap shorts and a t shirt
2138088 my first job in all honesty is going to continue to be mom in chief
2138089 she wanted to open the doors and let america see who she is she invited ebony into her inner circle
2138090 for an intimate conversation about how they live their lives
2138091 doesnt have to look good just throw the sheet over it
2138092 ive had an opportunity to talk to people whove done this before i had a great conversation with hillary clinton i also talked to tipper gore lots of folks who have had great advice on how do you make sure that your kids are whole and grounded
2138093 we are working together to make sure the fall campaign and the convention are a success at the democratic convention we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party will be fully unified heading into the november election
2138094 im asked this question every day it is a question that is a very obvious one to ask i mean what will happen at the convention in respect to you know my putting my name in nomination a roll call vote and the usual kind of process that happens at conventions
2138095 were trying to work that out with the obama campaign and the dnc
2138096 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected
2138097 i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel that ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind senator obama
2138098 delegates can decide to do this on their own they dont need permission they can decide under the rules of the dnc i think it would be better if we had a plan that we actually put in place
2138099 is the biggest celebrity in the world ready to help your family
2138100 the real obama promises higher taxes more government spending so fewer jobs
2138101 renewable energy to transform our economy create jobs and energy independence thats john mccain
2138102 while senator mccain knows that senator obama has proposed cutting taxes for 95 of american families what hes not telling us is that he wants to give 4 billion in tax breaks to the oil companies continue giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our job overseas and provide no direct tax relief for more than 100 million middle class families
2138103 while americans are struggling with gas prices john mccain is playing politics
2138104 every time you fill your tank the oil companies fill their pockets
2138105 now big oils filling john mccains campaign with 2 million in contributions because instead of taxing their windfall profits to help drivers mccain wants to give them another four billion in tax breaks
2138106 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
2138107 next year you and i and everybody else will be freer and have more space to say what we believe to be the truth about the primaries
2138108 il mio sogno sarebbe quello di vincere il titolo olimpico nel ping pong
2138109 we have made it very clear that they would have to have made substantial progress on a verification protocol and that when the day passes august 11 we will take another look at all that information and decide how to act and when
2138110 i think we have made it very clear to them that that deadline is really not a deadline but a minimum amount of time that we have to begin making our decisions
2138111 isnt it weird that i used to be so cold all of the time and now im kicking the sheets off and sweating in the middle of the night
2138112 once in a while every once in a long while you meet a person whose
2138113 he put one foot in the institutions he rose through on his journey but never fully engaged
2138114 it is dangerous for a national candidate to say things that people might remember
2138115 i asked how their bullpen was and if they were just looking for guys and they said no we think you can still pitch
2138116 weve been looking for a left hander for a long time and think this left hander can help
2138117 this is a veteran guy who has had a lot of success
2138118 hes had success in the playoffs and hell rise to the challenge hes been through it having those kind of experienced guys is helpful we think he has enough bullets in that 36 year old arm to help us
2138119 leave the lights off and the gentle ballpark at clark and addison would continue to blend into the surrounding brownstones
2138120 somehow the intimacy is lost in the lights installed because of progress and postseason play
2138121 i think the future of wrigley field is secure and assured because of the installation of this modern convenience
2138122 ill tell you what i will never forget the first pitch because as i wound up and turned to look at the plate it was i dont even know how to describe it i was almost blinded by all the flashcubes and lights that went off i dont know how many people flashed their camera at that time but i totally lost home plate somebody said later it was close well i couldnt argue i had no idea where it went
2138123 this must be something or all these people wouldnt be here wrigley field is like the last of the mohicans its a bright moment for baseball comparable to opening day and the world series
2138124 for the visiting players the trip to chicago was the best you had the sun beating down on you the smell of the green grass then after the game you could go out for a nice dinner like a normal person and have a night on the town it was great
2138125 one guy is even thinking about putting a skybox up there can you believe that
2138126 ill tell you what i will never forget the first pitch because as i wound up and turned to look at the plate it was i dont even know how to describe it
2138127 i was almost blinded by all the flashcubes and lights that went off i dont know how many people flashed their camera at that time but i totally lost home plate somebody said later it was close well i couldnt argue i had no idea where it went
2138128 you see how far that first home run by bradley went youve got to have good stuff to have a guy hit that one that far off you
2138129 it was kind of fun kind of loosened me up and i ended up having a good at bat
2138130 a wrath of god type thing i thought we were all going to be electrocuted for coming to a night game at wrigley field
2138131 we had a 2 hour 10 minute rain delay that we had to kill in tuxedos under blazing hot lights because wgn in those days never cut away so we were bringing in people from anywhere we could find them to try and kill the time
2138132 i remember that what should have been 8 8 88 was actually 8 9 88
2138133 that particular night was one of the most uncomfortable i had every spent in a tuxedo i think the next time i wore one was my wedding but im not sure
2138134 itd just be harder to come up with the 500
2138135 it was kind of like opening day that type of experience only bigger we had a two hour delay and were trying to pass the time and someone said lets slide on the tarp i had my sliding brothers jody davis les lancaster and al nipper it seemed like a good idea at the time jim frey i think fined us for it it was a 500 slip and slide but it was fun
2138136 someone said earlier that its kind of like the good lord letting us know hes a little sad too
2138137 he was probably the biggest link between the fans and the braves
2138138 he was a great ambassador for baseball and the atlanta braves
2138139 the united states is accusing our government venezuela me of helping lebanese movements in the middle east they are trying to take me to international court to see if the world will go along with the game against us
2138140 i think it will simply turn out badly for them if they play that kind of game
2138141 so that the eus relationship with all latin american countries remains positive
2138142 maybe we need to explain exactly to the president of venezuela what this directive eu law consists of
2138143 there have been many interpretations of this directive that have nothing to do with what it really is
2138144 yes i have one of the longest rescue poles around
2138145 its puppy dumping season and everyone is getting rid of their pets we get calls every single day and were simply full
2138146 charged with the responsibility of assisting local authorities in urban areas who have requested assistance due to pervasive criminal activity occurring in hot spots within their communities
2138147 yes i have one of the longest rescue poles around
2138148 this was the first time in a long time i had all my pitches working the way i wanted
2138149 i didnt realize it was a no hitter until the sixth when we got through the eighth people were telling me this could really happen
2138150 when im in the bullpen i dont look at the score
2138151 but when he came out of the game duffy told me weve got a no hitter going
2138152 his curve was unbelievable its great to have a pitcher like that coming in after you
2138153 i was hoping he would play yesterday but mother nature said not he had a good running day today so i think it is more likely that he can play the weekend but its not guaranteed
2138154 the opposite of a correct statement is a false statement but the opposite of a profound truth may well be another profound truth
2138155 democracy is a poor system of government at best the only thing that can honestly be said in its favor is that it is about eight times as good as any other method the human race has ever tried democracys worst faults is that its leaders are likely to reflect the faults and virtues of their constituents a depressingly low level but what else can you expect
2138156 there was so much to grok so little to grok from
2138157 use the money to help families pay for their skyrocketing energy costs and other bills
2138158 if youre hitting ahead of him its a good spot
2138159 if youre hitting behind him its a good spot not only is he a presence in the middle of the lineup he sets the table well the guy gets on base a lot
2138160 other pitchers and other teams know that vladdy can get on base any time he wants to theyre not going to give him anything to hit he can swing and get you any way
2138161 i went to college and thought i was the greatest player in the world
2138162 but i realized everyone at georgia tech was an all star and all american at their high schools
2138163 i went 0 for 16 and any time youre a 22 year old rookie and go 0 for 16 you think maybe i dont belong here
2138164 ill probably take him out to dinner wine and dine him let him see the o c orange county calif and l a
2138165 i always tell him the organization is wonderful he loves it here
2138166 artes done enough this is for free i would pay for dinner too
2138167 my entire career i never said i wanted a contract
2138168 i believe i was traded here to help the team win the world series
2138169 i dont think there has been any secret with that
2138170 weve got a long way to go offensively but he has really laid the groundwork for some of the right stuff
2138171 guys like playing for him we were just fortunate he was available he was the right guy at the right time
2138172 maybe if we can add here and there i think we certainly have a chance i would like to be part of it
2138173 citos going to have a big hand in what kind of staff we have here its important that hes comfortable with the staff
2138174 there is concern within gmp as to whether the correct procedures were followed
2138175 at one stage apparently a convoy of police vehicles was involved in the pursuit
2138176 gmp can confirm that eight police officers have had their driving authority withdrawn
2138177 martin can be quite forgetful and told me as soon as he came home what he had done
2138178 will we look back at this hundreds of years from now and regret it kinda like we do with the killing of bacteria with antibiotics now
2138179 neque porro quisquam est qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet consectetur adipisci velit
2138180 i am wondering what robbie coltrane would look like as a 16 year old im also wondering how he would get through the window of my house
2138181 password protected your dealing with geeks just turn it on type gandalf and youre in
2138182 at the 100 feet per minute speed shown in the video thats an astonishing two orders of magnitude more capital efficient than a high vacuum process a twenty times slower high vacuum tool would have cost about ten times as much per tool
2138183 the speech i was holding should only have been a backup i knew the words by heart because id lived them
2138184 eyes widened when i held up red and blue beanie babies that were as big as the real boys heads nodded when i held up my wedding band which a dime can just fit through and described it circling one babys arm like a hula hoop
2138185 oh crap what is that thing with the huge head coming this way
2138186 we try to make guys a little more aggressive in the strike zone and if you make a mistake with a major league team and give them four outs as opposed to three outs youre going to get hurt and youve got to take advantage of that
2138187 it takes a little bit of a load off my shoulders
2138188 ive been pressing real hard just to get one hit it was a big day for me but i think personally just getting two hits and not being someone who goes 1 for 4 or 0 for 3 i can take a lot of positives out of today
2138189 i just thought that he was a little bit out of rhythm
2138190 maybe we could speed his rhythm up a little bit by giving his signs a little bit quicker
2138191 personally i like to hear it come from myself rather than telling the pitching coach to go out and do that
2138192 when he goes out he pretty much is going to say what he needs to say when i go out there im going to say what i need to say and i thought that was the time to go out and tell him
2138193 my father felt his experiences in spain were the defining moment in his life
2138194 after he left he specialised in teaching those who were educationally disadvantaged and taught hundreds if not thousands of children to read he felt that if you couldnt read you were handicapped for life

2138207 hes a bulldog and eats up innings hes just a big game pitcher hes exciting to watch and you know what youre going to get every time
2138208 i dont think weve ever taken for granted what our starting pitchers are about and how important they are to us

2138222 over the last week barack obama made time in his busy schedule to hold a rally with 200 000 germans in berlin hold a press conference with french president nicholas sarkozy in paris and hold a solo press conference in front of 10 downing street in london
2138223 ive spent time at ramstein recovering from wounds received in the service of my country and im sure that senator obama could have made no better use of his time than to meet with our men and women in uniform there that barack obama believes otherwise casts serious doubt on his judgment and calls into question his priorities

2138247 this is about as locked in as ive seen anybody right now the way raul swings
2138248 and it just seems like the situations just seem to keep finding him
2138249 that was electric cliff floyd is a veteran hitter and has always been a good rbi man to get a strikeout there was huge and then to strike out navarro who is hitting 300 and swinging the bat well
2138250 they are getting an opportunity to learn at this level in games like this when were playing good quality teams we are holding our own against good teams and that is a good thing to build on for next season
2138251 the young guys are doing their jobs doing their work grinding it out and battling i dont see why we cant continue to do this
2138252 im not sure what the pitch was but he was able to get it and won the game for them andy was really good for us and hernandez was good for them as well
2138253 i think jeff knows he has to block that ball
2138254 i would have thought it was a passed ball not a wild pitch jeff felt bad about that ball getting away from him but felix is not an easy guy to handle his stuff is moving he has tremendous stuff on his breaking pitches and when you call for one of them you cant assume you know where its going to go that one got away from him
2138255 the sexual orientation thats been on the books for 10 years and weve never mounted a campaign to oppose it

2138257 i think its wrong to allow adoptions of children by gay and lesbian couples
2138258 i still think that there ought to be ways for us to provide a loving environment for children without sending a wrong message to them early or a message that we have to sit down and try to explain some psychological damage or emotional damage or something later on in life
2138259 i think that lesbianism and homosexuality is morally wrong and the laws supposed to discriminate sometimes

2138370 the u s electrical grid the system that carries electricity from producers to consumers is in dire straits
2138371 electricity generation and consumption have steadily risen placing an increased burden on a transmission system that was not designed to carry such a large load
2138372 in the years ahead we in the united states will have more and more problems with our electric grid this is likely to result in electrical outages of greater and greater durations
2138373 quite a few people believe that if there is a decline in oil production we can make up much of the difference by increasing our use of electricity more nuclear wind solar voltaic geothermal or even coal
2138374 if frequent electrical outages become common these problems are likely to spill over into the oil and natural gas sectors one reason this may happen is because electricity is used to move oil and natural gas through the pipelines in addition gas stations use electricity when pumping gasoline and homeowners often have natural gas water heaters and furnaces with electric ignition these too are likely to be disrupted by electrical power outages
2138375 the u s power transmission system is in urgent need of modernization
2138376 growth in electricity demand and investment in new power plants has not been matched by investment in new transmission facilities
2138377 despite efforts to mitigate blackout risk the data available from the north american electric reliability council nerc for 1984 2006 indicate that the frequency of large blackouts in the united states is not decreasing
2138378 the august 2003 blackout was a wake up call for the country to upgrade its transmission grid system
2138379 but the truth is that very few major transmission projects have been constructed and as a result transmission capacity has failed to keep pace with the expansion of power demand
2138380 in some cases demand has reached levels that were not expected for another three or four years
2138381 very hot weather tends to cause more incidents of equipment failure in the distribution systems although the bulk power system provided adequate supply extreme heat and surging demand put the distribution systems through extreme stress leading to some equipment failures and localized power outages
2138382 we are concerned about new england because there is nothing in the pipeline but some small renewable projects and wind
2138383 the need to strengthen the existing transmission infrastructure to expand it and to effectively harness advances in technology constitutes the single most pressing challenge for the countrys electricity system
2138384 whoever is responsible has shown a complete disregard for this womans welfare
2138385 attention has been drawn not only in south burlington but i think everyone is on notice that this kind of behavior will not be accepted and that people will stand up in the face of the odds
2138386 its not a matter of vindication its a matter of having this issue brought to light and to the attention of the courts

2138400 mortgage backed securities and the capital of life insurers was the industry prepared for the credit crunch of 2007 08
2138401 insurers behaved as though mortgage backed securities raised the quality of their portfolios
2138402 their reduction of capital indicates that they either were not aware or not concerned with the potential pitfalls of the securities

2138407 the repositioning of the concerned milf units particularly from the 105th base command of the milf is a positive development
2138408 as a manifestation that efforts for a peaceful solution to the conflict are working
2138409 this means they will be going back to their respective areas even as negotiations are being pursued for the complete pullout of milf forces our own troops have taken positions in neighboring barangays to provide security and assistance to displaced residents when they return to their homes and farmlands

2138436 we are acting for an elderly man who has bowel cancer and worked at the plant from 1955 to 1980
2138437 we are trying to gather information about three areas of the plant in which he worked to try and confirm what chemicals were used and how we can then establish if chemicals linked to bowel cancer were used
2138438 we have spoken to a number of witnesses who have been aware of a large number of people who have worked in the plant and consequently died from bowel cancer
2138439 there is a long history generally of people developing bowel cancer after being exposed to chemicals also we dont know what contaminated areas might still be around the site and pose a risk to people

2138455 france calls on all parties to cease hostilities immediately and return to without delay to negotiations which are the only way to resolve this crisis
2138456 i am shocked by the escalation of violence in south ossetia in the last 48 hours it is still unclear who is responsible for the new outbreak of violence
2138457 all combat operations must be stopped and all the forces that have been led to south ossetia in the last 48 hours must be pulled back i have expressed that opinion to georgian president saakashvili and
2138458 chancellor angela merkel has urged the conflict parties in south ossetia to show calm and restraint and called for an immediate stop to all use of force

2138481 ive lived my entire life thinking everything happens for a reason
2138482 im sitting in palo alto calif in my hotel room and eric walks in and says hey guys i have testicular cancer
2138483 ive got it i accept that and im going to beat it
2138484 i turned to eric and said good job buddy and you just saw like oh crap
2138485 i just said you dont look like a person who just made their first olympic team
2138486 if certain things had come back elevated and we found out that this was a rapidly moving form of cancer then my decision wouldve been made for me
2138487 i wouldnt be here but fortunately i dont know if my bodys fighting it or what but we have determined this is a very slow moving cancer so im able to be in the position im in
2138488 when you have basically the best guy in the world telling you youre going to be ok you kind of trust him
2138489 we were trying to figure out why he was being so coy after the trials and why he was late to camp in palo alto
2138490 rumors were flying around we were starting a bunch of them most of that was due to every time he told us that he would tell us later it was with a smile on his face i think the way he has handled this has kind of put everything in perspective for all of us
2138491 that was probably one of the hardest things to do for me talking about it in front of those guys
2138492 but they made it real easy for me the support that ive gotten has been tremendous
2138493 people ask me how ive been dealing with this and how i can remain focused on swimming its not very hard when you have the best olympic team in the world in your corner supporting you from now and for the rest of my life i know theyre going to be in my corner
2138494 i am human and this has been a roller coaster ride i think in those down times is when i look to the teammates on my left and right theyre the ones i look to during my down days because it is on my mind constantly i cant help that
2138495 the club is shocked and we just hope he turns up safe and well
2138496 chris is very popular respected and a well liked volunteer at the club
2138497 he is very knowledgeable about football and well known in the non league football scene
2138498 chris has worked at the school for more than seven years and is very popular and conscientious
2138499 huntinglife com has been committed to conservation from day one so it was a natural partnership to work with the sportsmans alliance for alaska to protect such amazing resources like bristol bay and the tongass national forest bristol bay is one of those areas in america where sportsmen from all walks of life dream of hunting moose caribou and bears or wetting a line pursuing the mighty salmon and trout partnering with the sportmans alliance for alaska on this wonderful project was a no brainer for team huntinglife
2138500 the need is urgent right now to engage hunters in this fight hunters and anglers both have a lot at stake in the future of bristol bay while bristol bay is most well known as one of the top sportfishing destinations on the planet its also a premier place for big game hunting hunters travel from across the globe to pursue trophy moose caribou and bear in this region
2138501 through the tremendous support and leadership of conservation minded companies like huntinglife com kimber leupold sitka gear and polartec im thrilled that hunters will now be able to learn more about the bristol bay region and how they can get involved in the fight to protect an iconic sporting destination the participation of the whitney family and alaska wilderness trips inc really put the icing on the cake as we were developing this promotion
2138502 putting together such an amazing package has been a blast this is a hunt that any hunter would be more then excited to be a part of
2138503 as members of the hunting and shooting industry we are in full support of protecting places like bristol bay to preserve hunting lands for future generations for several reasons not only is the natural environment critical to conserve but without hunting lands to access we lose hunters which we can ill afford in this day and age
2138504 as a company involved in the hunting industry sitka fully supports and is extremely thankful for the hard work that the sportsman s alliance of alaska is doing to protect the bristol bay region the bottom line is that the mining proposals would forever compromise the health of the area the tundra the big game and the fisheries in southwest alaska are a sustainable resource the long term health of the area both in an economic and an ecosystem sense depends on those resources if my kids and your kids cant hunt and fish there when theyre older weve screwed up big time
2138505 i shot my first trophy bull caribou right at the mouth of talarik creek one of the creeks that would be drained to provide water for the mine when i was 13 years old and the mine footprint area is a traditional calving grounds for the mulchatna caribou herd if this mine is permitted it will have a devastating effect on these animals and this regions wild character will forever be lost
2138506 for someone looking to lend support to an incredibly important conservation campaign and possibly end up on that alaska hunting trip of a lifetime this is a tremendous way to help make a difference while we cant match the dollars that the mining companies are throwing at this fight sportspersons have always shown a passion and a willingness to fight for places they care about
2138507 we will be looking to somebody to develop the force and see us become the second largest in the country again after the met
2138508 west midlands now have hundreds more officers than us that needs to be addressed
2138509 there is new data they didnt fully consider and therefore the cost effectiveness calculations are wrong
2138510 this will make it harder for people trying to secure treatment in greater manchester where it is not funded routinely
2138511 we hope it will not change policy in places which are paying for it but that is a concern
2138512 if the doctors say this is an effective treatment everyone who needs it should have access to it
2138513 it makes no sense to me that they would hand cancer patients a death sentence when they could treat them
2138514 it makes me so angry that people with a critical illness like cancer cant get an effective treatment and yet they will pay for cosmetic procedures
2138515 the decisions we have to make are some of the hardest in public life and nhs resources are not limitless
2138516 imagine the impact of a searchable source of tens or hundreds of millions of qdos status scores

2138527 today i got pitches that are in my hot spot
2138528 to be a great hitter you have to capitalize on those consistently day in and day out hopefully i can be consistent
2138529 he makes a difference because he is in the top of the lineup if we had a guy in the beginning that likes to get on base steal bases hitting triples scoring runs it would be different
2138530 we have cristian guzman cristian is a great hitter but he didnt steal too much he is not known for his speed but bonifacio makes a difference in our game
2138531 with that speed in front of the lineup he puts pressure on the defense
2138532 he has been outstanding that what we thought we would have early in the season and let ryan zimmerman drive in runs but when everybody got hurt theres nothing you can do but we found a piece of the puzzle
2138533 we dont seem to be making a lot of first pitch outs or outs where we are ahead in the count even if we make an out on the first pitch now we have guys hitting it on the barrel and taking a good swing at it
2138534 i found out that in the first inning my cutter was not working
2138535 i said let me throw my fastball and sinker away once in a while i threw the changeup everything was together except the first inning
2138536 we have new life new energy they enjoy being around each other right now

2138539 i dont understand a word of what you say vote chuck norris
2138540 but they have to understand my point they dont say anything they dont consult with players on what we can do to get better
2138541 we are going to miss those guys but we will get together in september and we want to know whats going on because theres been a lot of talking and we want to straighten out whats the case
2138542 we have to be better prepared for the whole thing
2138543 the whole thing has to be more organized there are people involved who have nothing to do with the players theyre trying to take advantage of things
2138544 we cant have those problems again we have to do a better job if the players feel more comfortable they will be able to do a better job
2138545 when i was warming up and heard my national anthem playing it was one of the greatest thrills of my life
2138546 its a different thing when youre pitching for your country so i want to be in this but we have to be better at it
2138547 ive been talking to members of the venezuelan baseball federation and i believe they are going to meet with major league baseball next week
2138548 but there were a lot of mistakes things happened in 2006 that we have to address and make sure we dont make the same mistakes
2138549 the main thing is to go over there and play baseball
2138550 when you look to this competition you want to get your family together and five minutes before the game you dont have the tickets thats something that cant happen next time
2138551 i have a lot of respect for him it was the fans in venezuela when he was the first manager they criticized him he made a lot of mistakes i know a lot of people deserve a second chance
2138552 it doesnt bother me i have a job to do
2138553 my job is to get these guys ready like i said im going to go back to venezuela and get together with a lot of these guys
2138554 i know these guys for a long long time and have a lot of respect for them and i want to know whats going on and thats what im going to do
2138555 i know we had some issues in orlando and puerto rico because capacity was only like 10 000 and you got a lot of people coming from venezuela a lot of family members and they said they didnt get tickets
2138556 the meals what can you do thats something that you cant control
2138557 i just want us to be as professional as we can be we have to be more organized
2138558 there are people there who wanted to fill their pockets
2138559 they thought things would be the same there as they were in venezuela and it was terrible organization
2138560 i want to be part of it but it has to be better it has to be right i hope everything is handled to the highest level so we can play

2138673 baseball is everywhere in the sense that it is so far reaching
2138674 it is saturated in our country but also in places you wouldnt expect it to be such as alaska which has a rich history of baseball that has been played there for over 100 years
2138675 this is the type of event that bill lee is all over hes a fun guy hes not called the spaceman for nothing
2138676 hes not going to disappoint his personality comes through his teammates the fans and the opponents all get a kick out of him hes a ballplayer but he knows how to put on a show
2138677 no matter where you go people are obsessed with it and are willing to go to a game in the middle of the night in alaska to watch people from all over the country come to watch it
2138678 he just thought this was something to do before he couldnt i think a lot of fans would like to get to all 30 parks in their lifetime ive been working for major league baseball for eight years and ive only been to about half the parks that josh went to in 27 days

2138681 hey my feet have grown that means that other male specific parts of me have grown too
2138682 looking at how the teams played last year in the world cup theyre all going to be good its going to be like playing a good triple a or major league team each game it will be hard
2138683 i am managing this team and in this format and you can put that on my shoulders
2138684 guys might have taken it lightly in the world baseball classic i think japan was the only team we beat and the ball was foul i think
2138685 we do have a starting rotation figured out but in international play i found out that nobody wants to tell us who they are pitching so im going to be mum on that subject
2138686 why so secretive when your standard operating procedure as a major league manager was always to announce starting rotations
2138687 ive been in international play a long time a lot of times weve played teams and theyve had two guys warming up in the bullpen right before game time i havent even gotten complete rosters left and right
2138688 this is a great experience to be here when it came closer to being a reality i just became more and more grateful for the chance to be here getting off the plane here it was a great feeling knowing people are there to see you in the games
2138689 when it came closer to being a reality i just became more and more grateful for the chance to be here getting off the plane here it was a great feeling knowing people are there to see you in the games
2138690 i saw michael phelps jennie finch we saw the williams sisters serena and venus these are athletes you hear about all the time its just fun everywhere you go there are people coming at you from a different country you just say hello to them
2138691 in training camp the door is open for players to make the team
2138692 when a player takes a year off you need to see how he recovers
2138693 we have talked about a contract but it makes sense for him to come to training camp for the tryout and then us talk about a contract
2138694 oh im so sorry for your condition is your hair blue wow

2138708 we didnt know that this was going to hit us this quick
2138709 people will say its the economy during bad economic times people gravitate to colleges and universities so they dont have to look for a job some of that could be going on here
2138710 its a good problem to have but its a management challenge
2138711 who profits from intentionally false information in the marketplace those who are in on the scam and positioned to benefit from the predictable response of people who believe the fraudulent information to be true
2138712 although the commissions order was issued under emergency authority in unusual market conditions it is based on several years of experience and analysis
2138713 i am very new at this blogging stuff so please bear with a newie
2138714 i might hear a complaint about a particular patent and then i look into it
2138715 more often than not its a screwball patent its an old problem but it has gotten worse in the last few years the workload of the patent office has gone up enormously
2138716 the problem of course is that this deceives a lot of investors
2138717 you cant go out and find investors for a new invention until you can come up with a patent to show that if you put all this money into a concept somebody else cant steal the idea
2138718 approving these kind of patents can make it easier for scam artists to con people if they can get patents for screwball ideas
2138719 the patent office used to say that they didnt patent perpetual motion machines but it turned out that there really was no such rule
2138720 more than half the popcorn didnt pop and i felt caught in some kind of insane popcorn crossfire while it was popping shot popcorn all over the place popped and unpopped it practically only makes a handful per refill horrid
2138721 we condemn in the strongest possible terms the militarys overthrow of the democratically elected government in mauritania and at present all non humanitarian foreign assistance is suspended and under review
2138722 we had such a fun time just like old times
2138723 i love him so much that i would ski naked down mount everest with a carnation up my nose if he asked me to
2138724 but it wasnt through running away i was going to cooperate
2138725 you can have my life story for twenty five thousand
2138726 we have according to police sources direct documentation indisputable evidence that olmert held fundraising dinners and asked multiple donors and organizations some of them charities and some of them government ministries he asked them for money for the same flight
2138727 as far as police are concerned theyre saying this is a smoking gun olmert cant get out of it and were going to have an indictment probably by the end of august
2138728 one young person suffering from shock remains in hospital but her injuries are not life threatening she is under observation
2138729 weve spoken to all the parents of the children involved and appraised them of whats going on
2138730 we have a system whereby as soon as an incident like this occurs we have a team dedicated to speak to mums and dads which is what theyve been doing all last night and its still going on now
2138731 it was a head on collision and the front of the bus has been destroyed there were several thunderstorms passing through the area at the time it has been raining quite hard
2138732 it appears that the tractor trailer collided with the bus
2138733 they were both pushed on to one side of the road and the bus then partially flipped over and ended up in a ditch
2138734 it was lucky really because it happened only 200 metres from a community centre a lot more people could have been hurt
2138735 i couldnt tear myself away from 3 quarks daily to the point of neglecting my work congratulations on this superb site
2138736 i have placed 3 quarks daily at the head of my list of web bookmarks
2138737 just wanted you to know im one of many who reads and enjoys 3 quarks almost daily
2138738 i still wont believe this story until it leaves the confines of the national enquirer and faux news
2138739 no vamos a ir para darles la foto y despu s irnos con las manos vac as necesitamos se ales y compromisos claves de que se va a empezar a trabajar concretamente en los temas que nos preocupan y que hasta ahora est n parados
2138740 thank you for your awesome posts deceiver is by far the best new blog i discovered this year
2138741 thank you for having the balls to cut through the spin and hype
2138742 oh my god can i come and work for you people
2138743 it is nice to get intellectual about something that really has no bearing on anyones life
2138744 another blog filled with the angry ramblings of the jealous and envious
2138745 interesting that most of the hypocrisy comes from popular and attractive women
2138746 love your site btw im so through with all that nasty perez like gossip based on nothing
2138747 how did i ever live without the keen insights and cutting observations of deceiver
2138748 they must be careful diligent and wise in needleworkes that beare away the prise
2138749 it changes the whole way you look at the recent moves in this market
2138750 a concern if an early freeze occurs during the latter half of august
2138751 the aim is to get 20 people to inspire 20 000 my husband and i have eight children and seven of them are boys for me it is very important that the young men in my house aspire to be something positive in society
2138752 that is why i was so keen we should have a launch here in manchester through the different phases of my life i have had people i can look up to role models i can talk to and ask questions of
2138753 that is what i believe is important in a role model it has to be someone you can talk to and ask questions of not a celebrity
2138754 we are in such a dynamic age this celebrity culture is such a massive influence everyone wants to get the bling and the accolades but they dont realise it is only the top one per cent who get that
2138755 here is our opportunity to celebrate the unsung heroes the parents community workers those people who tirelessly invest in their communities
2138756 this is one of the most significant outreach programmes from a government body i can remember
2138757 it is crucial we improve the life chances of young black boys
2138758 too few black men and boys achieve their full potential and the consequences of that are being seen socially and economically
2138759 there needs to be a collective effort to combat underachievement and low aspirations among our young black men these kids need realistic alternatives to show them that every opportunity is available to them
2138760 whether or not its cancelled depends on the situation itself
2138761 he stepped up to the plate today when we needed him to
2138762 today was either we leave here 1 1 2 or 3 1 2 games back in the standings he stepped up for us he showed us what hes made up of today playing in front of a full house and some of the hardest fans in baseball
2138763 i didnt see any intimidation and thats a really good lineup over there
2138764 obviously theyre leading the division i didnt see any fright or anything like that he made quality pitches he was able to throw his offspeed pitches for strikes
2138765 i know who is playing behind me we put up runs for me i try not to do too much i know what i can and cant do im a sinkerball ground ball guy thats what i was trying to do and i was putting them away with my curveball
2138766 were playing the first place team were right in the middle of a pennant chase and volstad goes out and pitches out of jams
2138767 it doesnt faze him these are great tests for him and its good to see him with that composure and mound presence
2138768 thats one of the things im going to have to deal with discomfort
2138769 its early august and there is still a lot of baseball to be played
2138770 right now 1 1 2 back youre right there if you go to 3 1 2 back youve got to climb a little bit you want to stay right here until september when we play these teams again that makes it a little more exciting
2138771 one can have differences with our left colleagues on various issues but in the quest for social justice it is one of the issues which unites many indians
2138772 surjeet was aware of the political compulsions of being a backward economy and backward society
2138773 therefore he was willing to take a pragmatic view of many things so we see in him an ideal representative of cause of social justice who was willing to look at practical possibilities of taking people with diverse perceptions to move the movement of social justice forward
2138774 he never lost sight that india is a country of great diversity and there was a need for strengthening the unity and diversity of the country he never did anything to encourage communal forces or promoted casteist feelings
2138775 its so easy sometimes to forget that this passion we have has been very instrumental in the lessons of life and the tribal knowledge that is passed is only surpassed by the quality of time we spend together
2138776 womens hunting journal is about all types of hunting from waterfowl to upland to big game hunting this journal is dedicated to those adventurous individuals who live to hunt and be in wild places
2138777 talks with iaea in the past two days were constructive and the two sides have reached some agreements
2138778 such talks on irans cooperation with iaea will continue in the future
2138779 we continue to be candid about our belief that all people should have the freedom to say what they think and worship as they choose
2138780 we strongly believe societies which allow the free expression of ideas tend to be the most prosperous and the most peaceful
2138781 candour is most effective when nations have built a relationship of respect and trust
2138782 ive worked hard to build that respect and trust i appreciate the chinese leadership that have worked hard to build that respect and trust
2138783 we resolutely oppose any words or actions which interfere in the internal affairs of another country in the name of issues such as human rights and religion
2138784 so i guess all ive got to say is go forth give it all youve got one could summon up an image of a roman emperor exhorting his athletes to take the field
2138785 so i guess all ive got to say is go for it give it all youve got
2138786 written with a quiet elegance and a profound knowledge of loves hidden places
2138787 seguimos siendo fieles a nuestra convicci n de que todos los pueblos deben tener la libertad para decir lo que piensan y rendir culto a lo que deseen
2138788 creemos firmemente que las sociedades que permiten la libertad de expresi n de ideas tienden a ser las m s pr speras y las m s pac ficas
2138789 no one writes from nothing and everything is borrowed from something else to be remixed
2138790 we now accept that the story was untrue and that he is not suffering from any such condition
2138791 we unreservedly apologise both to him and to his family for making this distressing allegation and for breaching his privacy
2138792 it was a tesla customer who got into that accident were aware of it because we service our vehicles
2138793 the rear ending caused the tesla driver to go under the car in front of him my guess is thats why the airbags didnt deploy
2138794 he was hitting his spots he looked like he had everything working when hes right thats exactly how he pitches he throws a lot of strikes and keeps them off the scoreboard i was glad to see he had a good night tonight
2138795 it seemed like after we scored a few runs they started swinging early so it helped me stay in the game a little longer
2138796 you always have a good feeling when hes on the mound particularly since hes had good success against cincinnati
2138797 the numbers say that and its just one of those freaky things in the game
2138798 youre going to have one team that you do well against and another team that you cant figure out i feel good when we go up five runs and roys on the mound i dont care if were playing the all star team its a pretty safe bet hes going to win the game
2138799 but i knew the guys were going to hold onto it
2138800 were playing at a park he loves to hit in and a team he loves to face
2138801 the only thing that didnt happen tonight is that he didnt hit one out of the ballpark he swung it well ive seen it coming the last couple days
2138802 its a good ballpark to hit in i enjoy coming here this is a place where ive had success in the past and you always have a little comfort when youve done well in a place
2138803 i try not to read too much into it i dont sit there and look at the schedule and say oh were going to cincinnati im going to get a bunch of hits you get a good feeling when you go to certain places and this is a place where i enjoy playing
2138804 people are quite enchanted by it because its bringing new life to something now obsolete i think theres something quite poetic about that
2138805 girls stop it no hitting play together or were leaving
2138806 ive got a 45 and a shovel i doubt anybody would miss you
2138807 we are at a fairly early stage of this but there are areas of the iranian economy that are vulnerable to targeted sanctions whether they be in the lng liquefied natural gas sector investment in the oil and gas sector imported refined products reinsurance other financial areas which are areas we would look at if we are looking to increase the pressure on the iranian leadership
2138808 a number of other countries that we would want to involve in those discussions as we go forward
2138809 les r sultats du mois de juillet 2008 sont tr s encourageants

2138815 rewards with good those who fulfill the commandments of the torah and punishes the one who transgresses its admonitions and that the ultimate reward is the world to come and that the ultimate punishment is kareiss
2138816 only those with deficient minds are attracted by these follies and for their sake leave the ways of truth

2138820 londoners are entitled to cleaner air and all of us operating vehicles whether they are cars buses taxis or commercial vehicles should do all we can to reduce emissions
2138821 this money could have been far better spent on grants or other incentives for the introduction of vehicles and equipment which actually would make a worthwhile improvement
2138822 con naza hay una qu mica especial tengo muy buena onda y la propuesta realmente me tienta en primer lugar porque nunca hice temporada en c rdoba y adem s porque va a haber mucha competencia y so est muy bueno genera mucha adrenalina

2138825 eye has not seen nor ear heard nor have entered into the heart of man the things which god has prepared for those who love him
2138826 i would strongly recommend giving some thought to how you will deal with escalating situations that could lead to personal safety problems
2138827 if things do escalate i would strongly advise that you do not face the situation alone the resolution of my situation came with the involvement of others i dont wish to go into details of this but others could mean the help of other bloggers others who live near you and others with some official and legal ability to help
2138828 tonight probably would have been enough to win any other night but not the way mussina was pitching he pitched an unbelievable game we have a great offense but he was able to shut them down
2138829 ive got some more games to pitch and hopefully i can keep doing what ive been doing
2138830 im not going to try to change anything or invent something new im just trying to keep going out there and preparing and doing what ive been doing
2138831 they were absolutely out of their heads i was behind them at the airport when they tried to get through control with a different bottle of vodka
2138832 security wouldnt let them through so they turned round put towels down in the car park and drank it out there
2138833 they should never have been let on the plane in the first place

2138863 obama says he wants energy independence but hes opposed to new drilling at home hes opposed to nuclear power he said the high cost of gasoline doesnt bother him it only rose too quickly tell that to the people who are driving the oldest automobiles
2138864 obamas claiming that putting air in your tires is the equivalent of new offshore drilling thats not an energy plan my friends thats a public service announcement
2138865 we need to drill offshore here and now when we exploit and find these new reserves of oil it will reduce the price of a barrel of oil thats just a fact when you increase supply the price of whatever it is will go down
2138866 obama might be a little bit confused yesterday he accused me of having president bush s policies on energy thats odd because he voted for the presidents energy bill and i voted against it
2138867 i know he hasnt been in the senate that long but even in the real world voting for something means you support it and voting against something means you oppose it

2138873 lower paid workers often take a bigger hit than higher paid workers so i would attribute the faster per capita income growth in the durham msa to better pay prospects for workers at the upper end of the pay scale

2138907 weve got a lot of talent here but were also a relatively young team
2138908 weve got the advantage however of four returning freshmen who played for the fillies last year plus three transfer students who played college level basketball for other programs
2138909 ive pretty well got the foundation laid for the abac program and it has worked well im going to stick with it
2138910 my strategy is going to stay the same although the team is young i think theyll step up and get the job done college level basketball is so much different than at the high school level where a team might have one or two predominant players in college play youve got to be constantly aware of whats happening with everyone or youll find yourself out of the game

2138912 the expansion of nuclear energy in the united states as a major component of our national energy policy
2138913 the whole reason we started down this path was the benefits written into the energy policy act of 2005
2138914 is a joint government industry cost shared effort that can help provide solutions to meet future base load energy demand and address climate change specifically np2010 seeks to demonstrate new untested processes for licensing reactors in the united states identify sites for new nuclear power plants complete first of a kind engineering of new reactor designs develop and bring to market advanced nuclear plant technologies and evaluate the business case for building new nuclear power plants
2138915 a monumental step toward the rebirth of nuclear power in the united states
2138916 selected nustart to demonstrate the nrcs untested process for licensing new reactors in the united states and for obtaining regulatory approval of new reactor designs
2138917 safe clean and reliable and for the foreseeable future it is the only mature emissions free technology that can supply the power america will need to meet the projected increase in demand for electricity over the next 25 years this is one of the reasons we have put so much emphasis on bringing about a nuclear renaissance here in the united states
2138918 there is a concern within this administration which i support that the imposition of a carbon cap in this country would may lead to the transfer of jobs and industry abroad to nations that do not have such a carbon cap
2138919 you would then have the us economy damaged on the one hand and the same emissions potentially even worse emissions
2138920 in over 50 years of operating experience the nuclear industry still has not managed to solve the problems of safety security and disposal of highly dangerous radioactive waste
2138921 until that happens were much better off investing in safer cleaner energy sources such as renewable wind geothermal tidal and solar projects

2138939 such unique concepts such as floating boats or water taxis and buses would defiantly push preston to the forefront within the lancashire region as well as help put the city on the map as an upcoming area in england as a whole that in itself would be a great boost for the local economy just from a tourism and attraction standpoint

2138944 there is no way you can find the time to accomplish your goal
2138945 i can confirm to you that we have lost the chance to hold the elections in october
2138946 we regret they were not able to complete the work on it
2138947 we dont feel the election law should be held hostage to the issue of kirkuk
2138948 we cannot hold an election in october because we need three months to prepare for the polls after the election law is passed
2138949 if the law is not passed in the next few days it will be very very difficult to hold the election before the end of the year
2138950 it was clear since july that it would be impossible to hold the election in october
2138951 we ask the un to investigate kirkuk events and to change its kurdish representative staffan de mistura in iraq

2138957 hundreds of pages as relating to communications with or among white house officials concerning candidates for us attorney positions in the central district of california the middle district of tennessee and the district of montana
2138958 the president has no inviolable constitutional prerogative to nominate us attorneys
2138959 instead us attorneys are inferior officers under article ii section 2 of the constitution and are nominated by the president because congress has provided for that authority
2138960 appears to be outside the scope of the committees investigative authority which is limited to areas which congress may legislate and instructed the rnc not to produce the category two documents at this time
2138961 accordingly the rnc is awaiting a determination by the white house as to whether it will invoke executive privilege over those documents
2138962 in the meantime the rnc is proceeding deliberately and cautiously by withholding them pending the outcome of the white houses discussion with the committee and concerning the white houses decision concerning invoking the privilege
2138963 willing to accept your invitation to meet with your staff together with representatives of the white house counsels office to discuss these issues in greater detail
2138964 the executive cannot identify a single judicial opinion that recognizes absolute immunity for senior presidential advisors in this or any other context
2138965 that simple yet critical fact bears repeating the asserted absolute immunity claim here is entirely unsupported by existing case law
2138966 the aspect of this lawsuit that is unprecedented is the notion that ms miers is absolutely immune from compelled congressional process the supreme court has reserved absolute immunity for very narrow circumstances involving the presidents personal exposure to suits for money damages based on his official conduct or concerning matters of national security or foreign affairs the executives current claim of absolute immunity from compelled congressional process for senior presidential aides is without any support in the case law
2138967 harriet miers is not immune from compelled congressional process she is legally required to testify pursuant to a duly issued congressional subpoena
2138968 the court once again emphasizes the narrow scope of todays decision the court holds only that ms miers and other senior presidential advisors do not have absolute immunity from compelled congressional process in the context of this particular subpoena dispute
2138969 there may be some instances where absolute or qualified immunity is appropriate for such advisors but this is not one of them
2138970 y our client has declined to produce or itemize the subpoenaed documents relying on the very executive privilege claim that was considered by judge bates and you have previously indicated that the rnc would adhere to the terms of a court resolution of the dispute between the committee and the executive
2138971 accordingly i expect you will provide any non privileged documents that your client possesses and an appropriate list and description of any subpoenaed documents that you continue to withhold
2138972 a limited number of u s attorneys could be targeted for removal and replacement
2138973 i asked for a meeting with harriet miers whom i had known since work i had been involved in with the american bar association and she immediately agreed to see me in august of 2006
2138974 why would republicans in the state of washington be angry with you
2138975 some believed i should convene a federal grand jury and bring innocent people before the grand jury
2138976 all of my actions as united states attorney had been coordinated with the department of justice
2138977 whatever the proper resolution of the extraordinarily important questions presented the public interest clearly favors further consideration of issues before defendants are required to take actions that may forever alter the constitutional balance of separation of powers
2138978 this is a good moment to lament some of what i see are the real problems of modern programming languages what objects

2138985 it started around the fireplace they had fire showing around the back of the chimney when the first truck arrived
2138986 we wont be fooled again teaching critical thinking via evaluation of hoax and historical revisionist websites in a library credit course
2138987 what i have a hard time imagining is how to design a series of information literacy classes to bridge the gap between uncritically using google and a thorough intellectual assessment of scholarly resources how do we break it into small engaging components that build on each other to give those critical thinking skills it is much easier to teach students the mechanics of searching of discovery is it encroaching on what academics should be doing as part of their course should schools have already taught them this by the time they set foot in our libraries its definitely beyond our traditional brief but given that we no longer have a monopoly on the best discovery tools is it time we sold the library as a place that has value because there are smart people who can give you personalised help to evaluate your information needs and the resources you find
2138988 congratulations weve survived thank you for all your hardwork and may we work together again

2138994 lahood wants to be national committeeman so he can lobby and sell influence like his predecessors thats not going to happen
2138995 five oclock today has come and gone and the gang of crooks that is rigging and ruining the republican party has failed to respond and is refusing to provide me with information in my campaign
2138996 so i will make all of them respond in court starting tomorrow andy mckenna is a rich boy and he has lots of money to hire lawyers but what can he do to repay illinois republicans for the destruction and devastation he is he doing to the state party
2138997 mckenna and his compatriots are trying to rig a vote in favor of ray lahood lahood may have been unsullied before he fell in with the crooks but it is a truism that if you lie down with dogs you will catch fleas lahood is catching fleas by associating with mckenna amp co
2138998 brian sheahan is also demonstrating he is unfit to serve in public office he should either resign from dupage county office or resign in protest from his republican party role as legal counsel because he is adding and abetting in false legal practices sheahan cannot serve a corrupt master and also serve the people of dupage
2138999 the republican party in illinois is a minority party and it is a shrinking party we should be trying to increase not inhibit participation at the state convention in decatur
2139000 finally ray lahood should withdraw as a candidate for national committeeman he is becoming associated with the combine with all of the unsavory elements in our state party and he is not fit to serve the nation when he acts as an associate of local crooks and criminals
2139001 at least five hours of high quality culture per week
2139002 all children and young people should have the chance to experience top quality culture whether that is seeing a play or dance performance learning a musical instrument or producing some creative writing
2139003 many of us remember the first ever live music we heard or the first ever performance we saw
2139004 i want all young people to have the chance to experience and take part in creative activities to help them learn and develop
2139005 this programme will give them the opportunity to learn in and about culture developing as critical spectators participants and creators of the cultural world around them
2139006 they will learn through culture using engagement with the arts and other activities to boost attainment other skills and personal development
2139007 some of this could be delivered in the school day but also we want to give young people the opportunity to do more out of the school day
2139008 the idea of the scheme were putting forward is very much for schools and local authorities to come forward with their plans of how they would deliver it
2139009 schools are not on their own the whole point of these pilots is that they will involve local musicians theatres galleries and other arts organisations in working with children
2139010 we are providing extra funding to make this a reality on the ground and the point of running pilots is precisely to work out the most effective way of helping more children to experience more cultural activities without creating extra work for schools
2139011 top quality theatre and dance performances world class exhibitions galleries museums and heritage sites
2139012 therell be thousands of year 6 children 10 or 11 year olds going to school today to rehearse for their sats national curriculum tests in may
2139013 now i think it would be much better to have a day doing poetry listening to music and having those cultural experiences but the government needs to free schools up from the constrictures that theyve put on them at the moment
2139014 with opposition from teachers this badly thought through policy has already started to crumble
2139015 everyone would like children to do more cultural activities but governments have to provide practical policies not just vague aspirations

2139035 after she had completed creation of the universe and the earth within it she felt great pleasure but her energy could not be depleted and she desired even further pleasure
2139036 so she conceived the human female form and took it unto herself

2139061 the square needs more natural light not artificial light i hope they put something in that will better address the ongoing litter problem
2139062 the money available for maintenance and even lighting is drying up rapidly so while the council pumps money into winckley square they are abandoning the rest of prestons open spaces to vandals and litter seems likely to me that unless the council change their policies on maintenance we will find that not long after pumping all this capital into winckley square it turns back into the neglected space it is now just like the other parks and play areas in preston
2139063 this big development is on the cards and if they go ahead would involve rehousing everyone currently living in empire house

2139077 ultimately the report argues to try to artificially kickstart the economies of liverpool sheffield leeds and other depressed northern towns is to miss the point the cities are poor for a serious economic reason not just the collapse of manufacturing which could theoretically be replaced by other industries quite simply theyre in the wrong place northern towns developed in most cases because of their access to the sea through harbours rivers and canals which made them ideally placed for international trade when most goods were carried by sea now that goods are increasingly carried by road and trade is more than ever with continental europe its the south that reaps the benefits

2139135 once again a well timed and well targeted lawsuit has sent the illinois republican party and its gang of conspirators into disarray
2139136 now they have to scramble to find some new stooge to replace lahood lahoods claim that he decided to go on a trip to lebanon is a face saving cover story the trip was in progress before he announced his plans to run for committeeman
2139137 lahood was the combines designated front man to maintain control of the honest graft generated by the party but lahood obviously had no taste for a knock down drag out battle for the committeemans slot so he quit the battle continues
2139138 sadly the leadership of the republican party is still trying to rig the convention
2139139 we have a court date june 2nd and we will be asking the judge to invalidate hundreds of illegally chosen convention delegates so that i can be elected national committeeman in an honest and open roll call vote on saturday june 7th

2139176 the partys establishment is backing a retiring official who no doubt wants to use the committeemans post as an accoutrement in a lobbying career the result would be predictable eventually there could be more scandal more conflicts of interest more cronyism and eventually more corruption when will they ever learn if i am known for anything it is for being scrupulously honest and an indefatigable corruption fighter this is what republicans need in 2008

2139304 if you continue to use polycarbonate baby bottles it is recommended that parents and caregivers do not put boiling water in them
2139305 these bottles can be sterilized according to instructions on infant formula labels and can be cleaned in the dishwasher they should be left to cool to room temperature before adding the infant formula
2139306 reaffirmed the safe of bpa in common consumer products such as baby bottles water bottles and food containers after exposure to bpa the human body including infants rapidly metabolizes and eliminates bpa and that exposure to bpa is well below the tolerable daily intake tdi
2139307 products made from bpa such as polycarbonate and epoxy resins are safe for consumers and the environment in current applications
2139308 exposure levels to bpa including exposure to infants and children are below those that may cause health effects
2139309 by a factor of five the safe intake level for bpa that was established in 2002 the increase was based on the panels view that there is now more certainty about the safety of bpa
2139310 bpa can continue to be safely used including with respect to infant and children exposures no bans or restrictions are needed

2139319 not fully convinced by his formulae i tried another mathematical approach and discovered to my surprise that the bulge should grow rapidly along the tube running just in front of the wave
2139320 i get rung up once a month or so by mad inventors
2139321 they came here with various tubes theyd built in their garages we tried the idea out in one or two tanks
2139322 it seemed to have a very good prospect of escaping two big problems that all wave power devices have to face
2139323 the anaconda escapes that because you can achieve similar resonance by making the speed of the bulge wave the natural speed of the bulge wave in the tube match the speed of the water waves outside
2139324 we could see the first full size device deployed off the uk coast in around five years time

2139326 the meteors are formed when the earth passes through the orbit of the swift tuttle comet

2139428 a number of treatments have crept into fertility clinics over the years and are now part of our usual repertoire but as with many things in infertility most of these have not been properly evaluated
2139429 almost all couples with unexplained infertility will have one or both of these treatments but neither of them is significantly more effective than telling the couple to just go home and get on with it which is a lot cheaper and more fun
2139430 these treatments are offered by virtually every district hospital up and down the country so the total costs are tremendous particularly at a time when potentially more effective treatments such as ivf arent being funded because of lack of money in the system
2139431 this has to change clinical guidelines because none of these interventions are free
2139432 as a direct result of the lack of evidence many couples with unexplained infertility endure and even request expensive potentially hazardous and often unnecessary treatments
2139433 intrauterine insemination has been offered to couples with unexplained infertility for many years but if there is no benefit in doing so then we should re evaluate the clinical guidelines so that nhs money is used wisely

2139677 this is something that i caught onto just before 2000 when there was so much search engine craze running around and started doing small just to test things at first but which i later expanded on after getting the hang of it
2139678 ive actually gotten over 87 million in advertising that using my secret i never had to pay for and the largest share of which was more recently in google pay per clicks as well as other forms of pad advertising at search engines all of which i got for free
2139679 wow ha this is really unique and in my expert opinion it would only serve to enhance and bring more business to us at name of search engine withheld for legal amp confidentiality reasons and not cause us to lose business in the slightest amazing

2139709 teaching a large first year course at a british university i am fed up with correcting my students atrocious spelling
2139710 but why must we suffer instead of complaining about the state of the education system as we correct the same mistakes year after year ive got a better idea university teachers should simply accept as variant spelling those words our students most commonly misspell
2139711 i could go on and add another 10 words that are commonly misspelt the word misspelt itself of course and all those others that break the i before e rule but i think i have made my point
2139712 all the data suggests that there are more and more students at university level whose spelling is not up to scratch universities are even finding they have masters level students who cannot spell

2139743 its increasingly a virtual world and everything about communicating interacting and developing relationships feels a bit different than it used to
2139744 the basic problem is that previous models counted the benefit of using land to grow biofuels but they didnt count the cost unfortunately when you dedicate land to growing a biofuel which is how most biofuels are produced youre actually using that land to produce the biofuel but youre not using that land to produce something else so if that something else was a forest or grassland and you end up plowing up that forest or grassland you get a huge release of carbon and that huge release of carbon is carbon thats been stored over decades and according to our calculations greatly exceeds the carbon benefit that you get per year of using biofuels so you get you have a long time before you pay off that debt but if instead you use existing cropland for the most part farmers around the world have to respond by making new food to replace the food thats no longer being grown on that cropland and again you get a large carbon release
2139745 use of u s croplands for biofuels increases greenhouse gases through emissions from land use change

2139761 the expansion of nuclear energy in the united states as a major component of our national energy policy
2139762 we have an opportunity to increase our supplies of electricity to meet projected demand over the next two decades america must have in place between 1 300 and 1 900 new electric plants much of this new generation will be fueled by natural gas however existing and new technologies offer us the opportunity to expand nuclear generation as well nuclear power today accounts for 20 percent of our countrys electricity this power source which causes no greenhouse gas emissions can play an expanding part in our energy future
2139763 safe clean and reliable and for the foreseeable future it is the only mature emissions free technology that can supply the power america will need to meet the projected increase in demand for electricity over the next 25 years this is one of the reasons we have put so much emphasis on bringing about a nuclear renaissance here in the united states
2139764 if i am elected president i will set this nation on a course to building 45 new reactors by the year 2030 with the ultimate goal of 100 new plants to power the homes and factories and cities of america
2139765 concerns over climate change suggest a larger role for nuclear power as an energy supply choice
2139766 the nuclear power 2010 program is working with industry to demonstrate the nuclear regulatory commission s new licensing process
2139767 is a joint government industry cost shared effort that can help provide solutions to meet future base load energy demand and address climate change specifically np2010 seeks to demonstrate new untested processes for licensing reactors in the united states identify sites for new nuclear power plants complete first of a kind engineering of new reactor designs develop and bring to market advanced nuclear plant technologies and evaluate the business case for building new nuclear power plants
2139768 the whole reason we started down this path was the benefits written into the energy policy act of 2005
2139769 a monumental step toward the rebirth of nuclear power in the united states
2139770 in over 50 years of operating experience the nuclear industry still has not managed to solve the problems of safety security and disposal of highly dangerous radioactive waste
2139771 until that happens were much better off investing in safer cleaner energy sources such as renewable wind geothermal tidal and solar projects
