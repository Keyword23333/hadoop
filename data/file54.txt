540091 a portuguesa tinha uma escala o que parecia ofensiva mas eles atuaram em grande parte do primeiro tempo com uma linha de quatro defensores dentro da grande rea e um volante frente deles n s notamos que havia um espa o entre o gavil n que era esse volante o lateral e o zagueiro pod amos usar essa triangula o e precis vamos de um meia com sa da o paulo conseguiu armar o jogo e liberou o romerito para fazer isso

540097 acho que muito cedo vejo entrevistas do pessoal que est na ponta da tabela que vem de bons resultados e ningu m define uma posi o mas temos que abrir os olhos e assumir de forma corajosa a fase que estamos passando hoje ningu m pode reclamar da torcida pois ela esteve ao nosso lado o tempo todo a responsabilidade s nossa

540099 best book on the economics of the contemporary art market
540100 the course is playing great the pins were a little easier than they were yesterday and the greens were a little softer
540101 the pins were just not as crazy i think the usga kind of listened to some guys and they did a good job with the setup
540102 some of them yesterday were on the side of slopes and if you got anywhere above the wrong side of the hole you were going to be 20 feet past no matter what
540103 today they are a lot more accessible but they are still tough
540104 i think tomorrow the key is going to be the front nine the group of guys that goes out there and lights it up on the front
540105 i started playing good two months ago im doing very well my putter is working now when i miss well im still with good concentration but im happy with my putting
540106 if i win tomorrow first of all its a dream for me
540107 but also to win the tournament tomorrow is very important for latin america and argentina
540108 i didnt like the lie when i saw it i couldnt believe how slow the first putt was the second putt i didnt think that thing was going to stop it kept rolling then went in the hole
540109 i thought to myself lets try to get it to 24 under
540110 somewhere mid swing the wind just dropped and that thing flew at least 10 yards further
540111 maybe it was adrenaline or not wanting to be short of that pin it wasnt that bad of a play
540112 i could take 20 or 30 balls out there and not make that putt again
540113 they had some pins today where you had a lot of breaking putts i dont know how i shot 65 i dont feel like i shot 65 i hit a few squirrely shots just like i have all week but the score is out there if you keep grinding it out
540114 i heard something about 1 beers for 45 minutes for every eagle
540115 i figured i needed to shoot 6 or 7 under to have a good chance going in to tomorrow
540116 i have nothing to lose tomorrow i just need one win and im wrapped up for everything but im probably going to have to shoot 9 under to win
540117 vance is a good guy to play with but im at ease with most everybody i play with

540157 it was kind of a no brain decision for us
540158 a major reason was to avoid the transportation costs which are terrible
540159 if we think about the wal mart model it is incredibly fuel intensive at every stage and at every one of those stages we are now seeing an inflation of the costs for boats trucks cars
540160 that is necessarily leading to a rethinking of this emissions intensive model whether the increased interest in growing foods locally producing locally or shopping locally and i think thats great
540161 if prices stay at these levels that could lead to some significant rearrangement of production among sectors and countries

540237 that was unusual for him not to call back and then when he didnt show up for work on tuesday we got worried
540238 he was a little guy with a heart bigger than you could know
540239 tim spent his life traveling and meeting new people and always saw the good in everyone he had the most infectious giggle you could hear him laughing a mile away
540240 it didnt matter what kind of a day you were having because when you heard him laugh you couldnt help but join in
540241 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
540242 i am curious just suppose for the sake of argument that scientists did
540243 how would it change your thinking if tomorrows headline was scientists now agree life was designed
540244 such action would be recognized as the ultimate demonstration of fair play by the whole world
540245 everyone has heard people quarreling they say things like this howd you like it if someone did the same thing to you that is my seat i was there first come on you promised now what interests me about all these remarks is that the man who makes them is not merely saying that the other mans behavior does not happen to please him and the other man very seldom replies to hell with your standard nearly always he tries to make out that what he has been doing does not really go against the standard or that if it does then there is some special excuse he pretends that there is some special reason in this particular case why the person who took the seat first should not keep it it looks very much as if both parties had in mind some kind of law or rule of fair play or decent behavior or morality or whatever you call it about which they really agree
540246 and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness
540247 reforming french protestantism the development of huguenot ecclesiastical institutions i happened to come across your blog and i was wondering if you were christian b4 or after this book
540248 the situation on the mountain is very serious and the reports we are getting so far are not good people are missing people are stuck at high altitudes and it would seem that some climbers are gone
540249 it is difficult to get information because rescue attempts are ongoing but of the 17 who were coming down we know that six are trapped and six are reported missing
540250 she is on her way down but the news is devastating bae and gerard would be good friends and there is a chance they were descending together we just dont know
540251 time is really important here you cant stay at high altitude all these climbers would be exhausted and it is vital that they get help high altitude porters are making their way to them and the hope is they will get there the weather is good and is expected to stay that way for a while
540252 he is a very driven very motivated guy he has lived in alaska for 10 years where he has honed his climbing and survival skills
540253 please god let ger be one of the climbers descending from the bottleneck our hearts are filled with fear but our thoughts are positive come home safe to us
540254 ger and all the climbers thoughts and prayers are with you as you descend may you find the safety of camp soon and come home to celebrate your success
540255 i am not trying to be argumentative i am trying to learn i was asking a question to help me understand why you came to the conclusion you did
540256 students should not be afraid to challenge their professors if they do it with grace and respect
540257 jane you certainly have some views on abortion and homosexuality that conflict with scriptures i was wondering how you reconcile your beliefs with clear biblical truths
540258 alex you know that since i left my old church ive been on an ever growing spiritual journey as god and i continue to work out my personal theology i am always amazed at how often my intuitive and i believe spirit led thoughts are affirmed by others often that which i considered original thought appears in a book or i hear someone else express it or i see something in the natural world that illustrates a concept
540259 the truth i know and accept is just this truth is a person and not a set of beliefs moral absolutes doctrines or a creed truth as a set of beliefs is exclusive but truth in the person of jesus christ is inclusive i would also like to suggest that the basis of tyranny like church violence past and present has also been absolute truth
540260 jane i will agree that truth is a person inclusive to all
540261 look alex to be his followers all we have to do is look at his life it is so very simple we dont even have to agree on the words he spoke his life spoke much more loudly than his words
540262 jane that line of reasoning self destructs if we ignore what jesus said in favor of what he did we in effect throw out his whole ministry because his life was lived in complete congruence with his words also think about his statement the words i have spoken to you are spirit and they are life if his statement is true his words are of the utmost importance if not he doesnt even deserve our attention much less our respect and worship
540263 and how do we know for sure that homosexuality is not a genetic trait maybe homosexuality is just another example of natures diversity i have a very difficult time believing that the majority of homosexuals choose to be that way
540264 jane researchers have been in a frantic search for the gay gene for decades to no avail and its clear why each guy that i have mentored and talked to involved in the gay culture confirm what every study ive read on the issue concludes that gay men all have either a history of sexual child abuse or of a physically emotionally or spiritual absent father each of these guys has told me personally that those who claim the gay lifestyle is not a choice are living the lie their words not mine this accords well with pauls analysis in romans 1 of those who not only suppress the truth but who exchange the truth of god for a lie this is a clear case of multiple attestation of the real issue here
540265 i just dont see how a gay couple wanting to live together harms anyone else except maybe the sensibilities of some individuals maybe if they were allowed to marry legally there would be less infidelity amongst them and with the horrendous trend of heterosexual infidelity we have a huge splinter in our eye
540266 jane youre right that hetero couples have not lived up to the biblical standard but it is clear from virtually all stats that the level of gay infidelity is off the chart especially in terms of numbers of partners outside of the primary relationship with 75 of gay men reporting over 100 partners this has made many observers conclude the gay juggernaut has nothing to do with commitment fidelity and monogamy but has everything to do with demanding societal acceptance approval and celebration of their twisted morality
540267 jane the scandinavian countries have had something close to full gay marriage for a decade or more this has severed to separate the idea of parenthood from marriage as a result studies have shown that the majority of children in those countries are born out of wedlock this is why society through the ages has revered and protected the uniqueness of marriage as one man and one woman
540268 well id like to see those studies i dont see how anyone can determine that gay marriage is the causal factor in the breakdown of society in scandinavia as in any study there are many variables
540269 alex i was trying to say that jesus unlike the religious right would have been an advocate for the homosexual anyway jesus accepted people never condemning anyone
540270 if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in sodom it would have remained to this day
540271 if homosexuality is such an important issue and such a grave sin why was it not specifically forbidden in the ten commandments why did jesus not condemn it
540272 jane if you question the immorality of homosexuality because of its omission in the decalogue and in jesus specific teachings do you also question the immorality of bestiality incest pedophilia rape wife beating child abuse drug dealing etc etc
540273 how can we judge the behaviors of others who have unimaginable struggles that we cant begin to understand
540274 jane you appear to embrace a mixture of hobbesian pragmaticism and relativism with regard to abortion and homosexuality that is if certain moral constraints are too difficult or impractical for individuals because of their genetic propensities or environmental circumstances then those constraints should not be imposed obviously there are many problems with such pragmatic view not the least of which is what would happen if every anti social behavior is condoned because hey thats the way god made me and god dont make junk unfortunately i think that our society has largely bought into that we increasingly see the legal defense of some of the most heinous crimes being founded on bad homes bad neighborhoods bad influences weak pre dispositions etc thus as moral responsibility and accountability have become vestiges of a forgotten past even perpetrators of crimes are being promoted as victims
540275 some people are just born different it seems to me that homosexuality could be compared to downs syndrome so maybe homosexuality is not a choice
540276 i know that you revere jesus expression of love and compassion however one of the ways jesus demonstrated this during his ministry was to be the advocate and defender of the powerless voiceless and unwanted in society and who today is more voiceless powerless and unwanted than the unborn that is why christians who take up the banner of pro choice in legal and respectful expressions of protest are reflecting the advocacy of their savior
540277 youre right alex jesus was an advocate and defender of the victims of society i wonder how he would stand on the issue of homosexuality today they have certainly been victims of persecution how often have we seen them ridiculed and discriminated against i am ashamed to say that in the past i have laughed at the jokes about them and looked at them in disgust but no more because that is not what jesus would do if he walked today among us i know this because i know him
540278 in my opinion god karma does not explain anything it is just a linguistic place filler until science can discover the actual cause
540279 yet the solution to these and other problems in my opinion is through the new sciences of complexity emergence and self organization
540280 alex all i got from your commentary was a one sided view of the pro life movement what about all of the so called pro lifers who bomb abortion clinics terrorize clinic staff and block womens legal access into such clinics
540281 jane i admit that christians have been guilty of incredible acts of violence
540282 well i can see both sides to this moral dilemma on each side there are moral and decent people
540283 jane youre quite right there are sincere and decent people on both sides of the issue who do good things and bad things im sure we each could name a few atheists who outshine many christians in altruistic acts however those acts do not make the atheist good any more than the lack of acts make the christian bad so how do you view this moral dilemma
540284 all i know is that there are situations when to allow a child to develop to full term would be cruel to both parents and child
540285 the difficulty is to know where to draw the line
540286 if we are intent on naming evil then let us name it intolerance
540287 any single biblical text may be trumped by the overall message which for christian s is a message of love and acceptance
540288 if one rejects anothers ideas he is automatically accused of disrespecting the person this often results in the very elitism regarding people relativists say they are trying to avoid christians who think their ideas are true are often verbally abused called bigoted disrespectful ignorant and can you believe it intolerant

540294 this new picture reveals that the hiv epidemic is and has been worse than previously known and underscores the challenges in confronting this disease
540295 these data which are based on new laboratory technology developed by cdc provide the clearest picture to date of the us hiv epidemic and unfortunately we are far from winning the battle against this preventable disease
540296 we as a nation have to come together to focus our efforts on expanding the prevention programs we know are effective
540297 while the level of hiv incidence is alarming stability in recent years suggests that prevention efforts are having an impact
540298 since i plan to speak with prime minister singh president hu jintao and already did so with bush we will see if it is possible to return to the negotiating table

540301 fifteen a means that in our opinion its for 15 and over but we do believe that the parent is the ultimate gatekeeper and some parents may feel that a child slightly younger than that age could deal with the issues in it in the context of the batman franchise we felt that this was darker and more violent than any of its predecessors and to naturally assume that it was the same would be a mistake this is a lot more menacing
540302 there are cases where people bring children too young and thats a shame but the vast majority is positive and people do act responsibly
540303 we always put the commentary in to give a guideline
540304 i think there are certain genres that are very violent but dirty harry came out in the 1970s and was particularly violent i wouldnt say that the level of violence is any more than it was heretofore its just with cgi and technology they have a better way of portraying it i think the techniques have a better way of showing the same violence

540314 the implications of this research at sunderland are enormous so much so that in the future we could be able to affect and change the rate at which our bodies age
540315 we age because our cells lose the desire to regenerate and repair themselves this ultimately results in cell death and decline of the organ functions for the brain resulting in memory decay and deterioration in general intellectual performance

540334 weve found that cb1 expression is lost in most colorectal cancers and when that happens a cancer promoting protein is free to inhibit cell death
540335 potential application of cannabinoids as anti tumor drugs is an exciting prospect because cannabinoid agonists synthetic molecules that mimic the action of natural molecules are being evaluated now to treat the side effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy
540336 turning cb1 back on and than treating with a cannabinoid agonist could provide a new approach to colorectal cancer treatment or prevention

540400 south east queensland alone and this is only within the bounds of the moreton bay marine park over 20 turtles a year are drowned in crab pots and most of those turtles caught in the crab pots wash up on the beaches and are found by the general public he said
540401 we were hoping that the current review of the crab fishery would see the government committing to phasing out turtle killing crab pots
540402 unfortunately the review has not even mentioned turtle deaths in crab pots
540403 due to the late date of the two parties nominating conventions and the relatively short period between the end of the conventions and the first proposed date it is likely that the four commission debates will be the sole series of debates in the fall campaign
540404 john mccain looks forward to debating barack obama as often as possible but its disappointing that to do joint town hall meetings
540405 we understand it might be beneath a worldwide of barack obamas magnitude to appear at town hall meetings alongside john mccain and directly answer questions from the american people but we hope hell reconsider
540406 were at war our economy is in turmoil and weve got so many challenges that the people of this country deserve a serious discourse and it shouldnt be limited necessarily to three kind of very regimented debates in the fall
540407 we ought to begin sooner and we ought to have a free flowing conversation about where we want to take this country
540408 no comment on anything related to the vice presidential issue
540409 its likely they will be the three appearances by the candidates this fall
540410 we understand it might be beneath a worldwide celebrity of s magnitude to appear at town hall meetings alongside john mccain and directly answer questions from the american people but we hope hell reconsider
540411 obviously we would have to think through the logistics on that but if i have the opportunity to debate substantive issues before the voters with john mccain thats something that i am going to welcome

540420 a controlled press which makes it more important that it publishes these things we begin to see inside the government
540421 hardly a day goes by now we dont see a clash somewhere there were three or four incidents over a recent weekend and the iranians are even naming the revolutionary guard officers who have been killed
540422 this is the ultimate for the iranians to blame the c i a
540423 this is new and its an escalation a ratcheting up of tensions
540424 in gardiners view the violence rather than weakening irans religious government may generate support for it
540425 weve got exposure because of the transfer of our weapons and our communications gear the iranians will be able to make the argument that the opposition was inspired by the americans how many times have we tried this without asking the right questions is the risk worth it
540426 just because lebanon iraq and pakistan have ethnic problems it does not mean that iran is suffering from the same issue
540427 iran is an old country like france and germany and its citizens are just as nationalistic the u s is overestimating ethnic tension in iran
540428 you can always find some activist groups that will go and kill a policeman but working with the minorities will backfire and alienate the majority of the population
540429 the baluchis are sunni fundamentalists who hate the regime in tehran but you can also describe them as al qaeda
540430 these are guys who cut off the heads of nonbelievers in this case its shiite iranians the irony is that were once again working with sunni fundamentalists just as we did in afghanistan in the nineteen eighties
540431 this is a vicious salafi organization whose followers attended the same madrassas as the taliban and pakistani extremists
540432 they are suspected of having links to al qaeda and they are also thought to be tied to the drug culture
540433 the new task force will work with the m e k the administration is desperate for results
540434 the m e k has no c p a auditing the books and its leaders are thought to have been lining their pockets for years if people only knew what the m e k is getting and how much is going to its bank accounts and yet it is almost useless for the purposes the administration intends
540435 malikis increasingly choosing the interests of iraq over the interests of the united states
540436 seem to be harming relations with the governments of both iraq and pakistan and could well be strengthening the connection between tehran and baghdad
540437 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
540438 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
540439 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
540440 my opponent talks a great deal about hope and change and education is as good a test as any of his seriousness
540441 if sen obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans
540442 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech

540501 wir haben nat rlich als betriebliche vertreter auf erhalt des stahlstandorts gepocht bis zum schlu wir konnten aber auch gar nicht anders wir konnten nicht sagen also wir gucken mal da wir einen ordentlichen sozialplan hinkriegen oder da wir nur teile des unternehmens retten es ging nur eins sieg oder blut am stiefel

540509 it would be nice to win a wgc maybe 20 or 30 years from now theyll have prestige much like the guys who first won the masters had no idea what the tournament was going to become they wgc events started midway through my career so i havent given them the priority like i do a major or care about them like a major but they are always the best fields on great courses so theres a lot of merit to whoever wins
540510 these are a rung down obviously from the major championships but i havent won a world golf championships so thats obviously missing on my cv it would mean a lot and give me a massive amount of confidence going into next week too
540511 for a couple of days afterwards what if goes through your head that i could have been the u s open champion
540512 at the same time you cant let yourself dwell on those emotions and youve got to turn the positives out that you played great under pressure and nearly won a major
540513 if i do play well if i do start playing well like i did today i think i would be an addition to the team
540514 and if i dont play well i would not be i would not expect a pick i just want to play as well as i can and see where it takes me
540515 im a long way out of it at the moment and i need to show excellent form
540516 ive got four tournaments left and i need to play well in those
540517 if i do he may consider me for a pick if i dont ill be watching it on tv like everybody else
540518 all summer long and probably the past three to four months ive pushed and pushed and pushed and tried too hard and practiced too hard and worked too hard
540519 ive wanted to play too well too much whereas now im just playing and enjoying it and seeing what that brings
540520 its really good to get back on to pure greens again as good as these are and start rolling in those four or five footers to save par
540521 i havent been making those this year and that puts me on the back foot straightaway like anybody ive gone back to my old method wider stance and slightly higher hands
540522 he hit a lot of good iron shots and made some nice putts hopefully we can do the same tomorrow
540523 it could have been a better round than that but youve got to take what it gives you a few short putts here and there would have made a big difference but i made a few as well so that kind of evens it out
540524 it was fine i was focused on my round i wasnt worried about phil and im sure he wasnt worried about me
540525 i dont know what the other groups had but gosh we had a lot of people
540526 i thought the crowds were great they were funny made some funny comments and it was really fun they were great to both me and vijay it was a great day
540527 we both birdied 15 we both birdied 16 and i thought both of us played okay played pretty good
540528 we could have been better could have been worse tomorrow will be a fun shootout
540529 its going to be a big challenge with four guys being right there and a number of guys right behind us
540530 so im not really thinking about what it would mean
540531 he hit a lot of good iron shots and made some nice putts hopefully we can do the same tomorrow
540532 it could have been a better round than that but youve got to take what it gives you a few short putts here and there would have made a big difference but i made a few as well so that kind of evens it out
540533 it was fine i was focused on my round i wasnt worried about phil and im sure he wasnt worried about me
540534 i dont know what the other groups had but gosh we had a lot of people
540535 i thought the crowds were great they were funny made some funny comments and it was really fun they were great to both me and vijay it was a great day
540536 we both birdied 15 we both birdied 16 and i thought both of us played okay played pretty good
540537 we could have been better could have been worse tomorrow will be a fun shootout
540538 its going to be a big challenge with four guys being right there and a number of guys right behind us
540539 so im not really thinking about what it would mean
540540 needed to throw one more time and let me know that tommy john is what needs to be done
540541 its gonna suck but i gotta have a lot of patience once i put my mind to something i get determined and its going to be something i work hard towards

540543 never had any arm problems ive never missed one game in professional baseball because of arm trouble this is the first time ive ever had to deal with any kind of arm issues
540544 this is definitely unexpected to say the least this is all new to me but i know that its stuff that has to be done and ive got the best guys in the world doing it im confident that everything is oging to come out better than before
540545 drilling is out of the question because cheaper oil is not worth the possibility of damaging our precious landscapes or wildlife and we need to cut fossil fuel use because of global warming and high gas prices are the best thing to make that happen
540546 if something like bush lifting the ban on offshore drilling can cause oil to plummet by 16 barrel just think what 3 5 million new barrels onto the market would do
540547 but the u s energy information administration an independent statistical agency within the department of energy concluded that new oil from anwr would lower the world price of oil by no more than 1 44 per barrel and possibly have as little effect as 41 cents per barrel and would have its largest impact nearly 20 years from now if congress voted to open the refuge today
540548 but lets say that is true what good is wind or solar going to be in that time frame to power cars you could say electric cars but not in this time frame you cannot replace the hundreds of millions of gas powered cars in the u s within this time frame can you explain what is going to happen to the batteries from the hundreds of millions of cars when they wear out
540549 replacing hundreds of millions of gas power cars within this time frame
540550 access to the pacific atlantic and eastern gulf regions would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030
540551 do you think oil companies would sell oil to us consumers for one cent less than they could get from french consumers no where oil comes from has no effect on price
540552 then there are the distribution concerns and as youve mentioned battery concerns as it is well known that these batteries are every bit as bad for the environment as our other resources
540553 if something like bush lifting the ban on offshore drilling can cause oil to plummet by 16 barrel just think what 3 5 million new barrels onto the market would do
540554 every barrel of anwr oil production reduces crude oil imports by about a barrel
540555 then you say in 30 years gas will be 12 a gallon if this drilling will not effect the price of oil dont you think gas will not increase more than 2 a gallon over a 15 20 year period
540556 as for car batteries let me clear up my statement i was talking about the batteries that will be in electric cars have you thought about how to dispose of those
540557 as for you so called correction about transmission lines going to the
540558 does it not matter to you that gas produced in america will keep the u
540559 every barrel of anwr oil production reduces crude oil imports by about a barrel
540560 looks like the dems would rather go on a five week vacation than debate what to do about the price of gas
540561 new oil from anwr would lower the world price of oil by no more than 1 44 per barrel and possibly have as little effect as 41 cents per barrel and would have its largest impact nearly 20 years from now if congress voted to open the refuge today
540562 i assume this would also be true for ocs oil

540617 i have to say when i was told about the storyline i kind of agreed
540618 obviously i was kind of sad and sort of depressed in that sense about im going to miss everyone and the character but i think with her i think she really came full circle and she went through so much and it felt just right
540619 id be in a mall or wherever and people would come up saying ive never cried so much

540633 along with a few other fair board members in the early 1980s tanton founded a nationalist organization called witan short for the old english term

540744 he was a very nice polite guy we wouldve had no reason to let him go before all this happened
540745 that was unusual for him not to call back and then when he didnt show up for work on tuesday we got worried
540746 he was a little guy with a heart bigger than you could know
540747 tim spent his life traveling and meeting new people and always saw the good in everyone he had the most infectious giggle you could hear him laughing a mile away
540748 it didnt matter what kind of a day you were having because when you heard him laugh you couldnt help but join in

540750 lo siguiente el paso final es que se saque el vih sida de la lista de enfermedades contagiosas consideradas peligrosas para la salud p blica que todav a mantiene el departamento de salud
540751 uno de los argumentos para mantener la prohibici n era el costo de los tratamientos contre la enfermedad cuando en realidad cualquier persona que solicite la residencia tiene que demostrarle a las autoridades migratorias que puede mantenerse por s misma y por lo tanto pagar por sus costos de salud
540752 bonds and cash have the false allure of safety since their principal fluctuates less than that of equities but equities along with commodities will better allow boomers to maintain their standard of living over decades
540753 boomers must learn to live with the volatility of equities if they want to keep their purchasing power intact
540754 there is a fear the economy is in a recession or going into one and people may find their jobs in jeopardy
540755 when you talk to people on the street they seem to be really being squeezed at the pump and the supermarket while their income isnt keeping up
540756 consumers inflation expectations fuelled by increasing prices at the pump are now at an all time high and are likely to rise further in the months ahead
540757 as for the short term outlook the expectations index suggests little likelihood of a turnaround in the immediate months ahead
540758 consideration was given to the impact of current and anticipated economic trends
540759 in the aftermath of a long credit driven boom it would not be surprising to see turmoil in financial markets slowing real growth and temporarily rising inflation
540760 while difficult to predict their interaction does appear to point to a deeper and more protracted global downturn than the consensus view seems to expect
540761 consensus view is still that the global economy will slow only modestly further in 2008
540762 between inflation and the liquidity crisis this is one of the toughest markets ive seen
540763 but its not a market you sell into any losses you take by being too early will be more than offset by buying cheaply
540764 how easy is it to steal an election using absentee ballots very easy very easy
540765 the absentee ballot box is the most vulnerable to voter fraud without changing the loopholes our laws allow of this
540766 you go after black people you go after black democrats you prosecute them for vote fraud boom
540767 i have seen the plastering coming up through the country
540768 when an individual sets out to study live or work in a new country he or she will invariably experience difficulties with language housing friends schoolwork
540769 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful
540770 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
540771 im right and youre a fool for believing the way you do
540772 i know you will find a good home for him
540773 i had the courage and the judgment to say that i would rather lose a political campaign than lose a war it seems to me that senator obama would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
540774 but russian behavior becomes less and less in the interests of us throughout the world frankly than we had hoped and anticipated when the berlin wall came down
540775 snails are really good i love them they taste a little like salty salty salty boogers

540778 right now we have a significant infrastructure deficit the result is poor productivity and increased pressure on inflation and interest rates this deficit spans from our roading network through to our energy supply
540779 nor is the problem limited to central government over the next decade local government will face an infrastructure deficit of some 30 billion
540780 national believes building better infrastructure is essential to fuelling higher levels of non inflationary economic growth for years to come
540781 nationals plan to step up investment in critical and necessary infrastructure will be done at the same time as remaining within conservative debt levels
540782 this investment will deliver considerable returns to new zealanders for generations to come that return will come in the form of enhanced services and enhanced capacity for our economy to grow and compete with the rest of the world
540783 right now new zealand doesnt have a debt problem it has a growth problem
540784 national is not prepared to stand by and watch new zealand be held back by utterly inadequate transport networks inadequate electricity supply and inadequate telecommunications
540785 you had it all hooked up correctly and i just put all the wires back together
540786 just remember you dont need a license to hunt to shot gun your hunting partner
540787 i think if we can resolve the problem between india and the united states i think well have an accord it can take a month two months but we need to sign an accord
540788 i said to president bush that its not possible for people to just lie on the beach after so much work after so much meeting and negotiation i think if the problem between india and the united states is resolved an agreement will be signed
540789 something abnormal happened in my opinion during the doha round we were so close to making an agreement and it didnt happen because of minor issues
540790 animated versions of the one frame cartoons you might see in the new yorker only edgier
540791 the weather channel and its employees will have increased opportunities for growth

540793 every british athlete that goes into the olympic village from july 27 will have been tested educated and there can be no excuse
540794 we are being tougher than ever and we are saying to every athlete in his country that you are going to be tested
540795 we are not allowed to sell it during the olympic period and its not clear what will happen afterwards
540796 never in my most bearish dreams six months ago did i think wed be talking about negative 15 percent numbers against weak comps
540797 i think the probability is very high that there will be a number of examples of individual newspapers and newspaper companies that fall into a loss position and i think its inevitable that there will be closures in this industry and maybe bankruptcies
540798 frankly im not terribly surprised that he helped stop the attack heck hes an expert on riots and mobs so he probably knows a thing or two about how to act in a seemingly chaotic environment
540799 a onetime person of interest moves a step closer to public exoneration
540800 having been named a person of interest in the investigation of the 2001 anthrax attacks the former army scientist steven j hatfill has tried for six years to clear his name both inside court and out now the disclosure that a former colleague died this week apparently by suicide just as investigators prepared to seek his indictment in the case has provided the clearest indication yet that dr hatfill may finally achieve his goal

540803 president clintons beautiful plane the one reporters had been so jealous of just days before is now grounded apparently as the 767 sped down the runway in adas ababa the take off was aborted engine problems everyone on board is fine but the plane is not clinton will now join the press plane which had to turn around mid air to retrieve the grounded president
540804 hes still playing great it happens in every sport when someone sets the bar so high guys find a way of creeping up behind you
540805 i dont think theres a huge difference between a semifinal and a final but to win it would be huge
540806 im going to have to play against one of the best players in the world to win it i feel like im playing well enough to do it
540807 kbr can confirm that a message was sent to employees in iraq as a result of a safety and security concern
540808 the matter giving rise to this message is still being reviewed by kbr management so the company will not provide further comment at this time
540809 with the liberal party youre dealing with not a question of personalities its policies
540810 what weve inherited from 12 years of mr costello as treasurer is the second highest interest rates in the developed world together with his being part and parcel of a government which was engaged in climate change denial and work choices
540811 so on that score ive got to say its quite clear cut to me that the liberals whoever their leader is have a real problem with their policy direction for the nations future because of the legacy they left us from the past
540812 i think if we can resolve the problem between india and the united states i think well have an accord it can take a month two months but we need to sign an accord
540813 i said to president bush that its not possible for people to just lie on the beach after so much work after so much meeting and negotiation i think if the problem between india and the united states is resolved an agreement will be signed

540815 this new picture reveals that the hiv epidemic is and has been worse than previously known and underscores the challenges in confronting this disease kevin fenton director of the cdcs national centre for hiv aids viral hepatitis std and tb prevention
540816 these data which are based on new laboratory technology developed by cdc provide the clearest picture to date of the us hiv epidemic and unfortunately we are far from winning the battle against this preventable disease said cdc director julie gerberding
540817 we as a nation have to come together to focus our efforts on expanding the prevention programs we know are effective she said
540818 while the level of hiv incidence is alarming stability in recent years suggests that prevention efforts are having an impact said richard wolitski acting director of the cdcs division of hiv aids prevention
540819 fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me
540820 for now there have been no legislative changes the reflection paper is advisory and the matters raised will need to be addressed by the synods or conventions of each province
540821 resolution 1 10 of the last lambeth conference now again reaffirmed as still expressing the mind of the church as a whole

540827 how does it feel to be your own worst enemy
540828 akan muncul di akhir zaman orang orang yang mencari dunia dengan agama
540829 apakah dengan ku kasih dan kesempatan yang kuberikan kalian tertipu ataukah kalian berani kepada ku demi diriku aku bersumpah aku akan mengirim bencana dari antara mereka sendiri yang menjadikan orang orang santun menjadi kebingungan apalagi selain mereka sehingga mereka tidak mampu melepaskan diri darinya
540830 ulama su duduk di depan pintu surga dan mengajak manusia untuk masuk ke dalamnya dengan ucapan dan seruan seruan mereka
540831 janganlah engkau dengarkan seruan mereka seandainya seruan mereka itu benar tentu mereka adalah orang yang pertama kali memenuhi seruan itu
540832 wahai daud jangan engkau jadikan antara aku dan antara dirimu seorang alim yang sudah tergoda oleh dunia sehingga ia bisa menghalangimu dari jalan mahabbahku karena sesungguhnya mereka adalah para begal yang membegal jalannya hamba hambaku sesungguhnya hukuman terkecil yang aku kenakan untuk mereka adalah aku cabut kelezatan bermunajat dari hati mereka
540833 akan ada sekelompok penduduk surga yang melongok melihat sekelompok penduduk neraka
540834 apa yang membuat kalian masuk neraka padahal kami masuk surga karena jasa didikan dan ajaranmu
540835 sesungguhnya kami memerintahkan kalian melakukan kebaikan namun kami sendiri tidak melaksanakannya
540836 tergelincirnya seorang alim debatnya orang munafik dengan ayat dan penetapan hukumnya para imam yang menyesatkan
540837 sesungguhnya kita dulu ada dalam kejahiliahan lalu allah menganugerahkan kepada kami kebaikan ini maka apakah setelah kebaikan ini ada keburukan

540839 tim spent his life travelling and meeting new people and always saw the good in everyone alex mclean tim mcleans uncle said reading from a statement on behalf of the family
540840 he was a little guy with a heart bigger than you could know
540841 you could hear him laughing a mile away it didnt matter what kind of a day you were having because when you heard him laugh you couldnt help but join in
540842 badger is armed with a knife and a pair of scissors and he is defiling the body at the front of the bus as we speak an officer says on the transmission
540843 operational police communications and as such are not meant for public consumption
540844 okay badgers at the back of the bus hacking off pieces and eating it the transmission ends
540845 model employee had been accused of the grisly attack vincent augert an independent contractor who distributes newspapers in edmonton said that li was one of his most reliable carriers
540846 he was very punctual and always cleanly dressed augert said
540847 that was unusual for him not to call back and then when he didnt show up for work on tuesday we got worried said augert
540848 and then when i found out in the news that li was being pinned for the brutal attack i was in utter shock he said
540849 i never knew tim and his family but i wish all the best in this awful time wrote tamara from edmonton
540850 its something right out of a horror movie added sheena in edmonton
540851 the outpouring of well wishes from complete strangers has been overwhelming he said
540852 the family appreciates all the love and support from friends loved ones and the public nationwide
540853 as of right now weve seen little to no impact on ticket sales and inter city bus travel continues to be a safe way to travel said wambaugh in a phone interview
540854 they are taught to immediately pull over the bus and call the authorities said wambaugh
540855 he was even better than they say he was he had everything speed stickhandling scoring ability and was a punishing checker he was strongly built but beautifully proportioned and he had an almost animal rhythm
540856 richard well he caused a riot after nailing a linesman
540857 we have to guard against infodemics in which inaccurate false information is disseminated prompting social unrest that spreads like an epidemic
540858 the reality is that we lack the means to effectively deal with harmful internet messages
540859 the regulations violate the autonomy of the internet and are an effective tool for tighter media control by the government
540860 the regulations would bring about a reverse in the advancement of the internet media as a whole
540861 but the internet media should also serve public good and compared with other countries south korea has lacked the institutional control over the media in which people tend to expand and reproduce unverified one sided information
540862 if you want to sue me with the cyber defamation law go ahead history will charge you with insulting south koreans
540863 the study highlights that traits that we typically ascribe to humans only can also be found in other seemingly simpler animals and that no consciousness or self awareness is needed for a behavior like deception to occur
540864 no les dejamos pensar ni establecerse tampoco pueden comunicarse porque les detectamos todo pero no hay que ser triunfalistas ni subestimar al enemigo
540865 ese territorio parece dise ado por la mano del diablo es perfecto para una guerra de guerrillas selva espesa donde no llega la tecnolog a arrugas en los montes abismos cuevas para esconderse infinidad de r os
540866 i see you have herds of livestock all over your ranch but you have no fences
540867 for i would have you know that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man for i neither received it from man nor was i taught it but i received it through a revelation of jesus christ
540868 the things which i write to you are the commandments of the lord
540869 be kind toward all an apt teacher patient correcting opponents with gentleness perhaps god will grant them repentance and then knowledge of the truth and they will come to their senses and escape the devils trap where they are held captive to do his will
540870 let no one look down on your youthfulness but rather in speech conduct love faith and purity show yourself an example of those who believe
540871 shall we indeed accept good from god and not accept adversity
540872 naked i came from my mothers womb and naked i will return there lord takes away may the name of the lord be blessed
540873 afflicted with a malignant ulcer from the sole of his feet to the top of his head
540874 are you still holding firmly to your integrity curse god and die
540875 all scripture is inspired by god and profitable for teaching for reproof for correction for training in righteousness so that the man of god may be adequate equipped for every good work
540876 now i have a legitimate reason to wallow in self pity
540877 those words arent bad anymore its only peoples perception of the words that is bad
540878 well you know i think i need to start watching porn again and well id love a beer tonight
540879 well god understands hes cool with me because he knows i talk this way
540880 we have made some terrible mistakes in iraq and it is only by talking about them that we will learn from them
540881 last autumn we made a mistake which was understandable but not excusable a shia prisoner ahmed al fartusi said he could put a stop to the killings we released 120 of their prisoners and withdrew out of town but when we moved out lawlessness took over as 90 per cent of the attacks were against us we thought if we moved out we would remove the source of the problem but actually the jaish al mahdi the mahdi army known to british troops as the jam had been fighting us because we were the only obstacle to their total control
540882 very hot when we asked them for more information bush laughed and said when we share information with your guys the bad guys always run away
540883 the question is why its taken the americans so long to see what the isi is doing
540884 weve been telling them for years but they wouldnt buy it
540885 there is no involvement by the isi of any form in afghanistan
540886 the security of pakistan afghanistan the entire region and maybe that of the whole world will be determined by developments in the tribal areas over the next few months
540887 the indian embassy bombing seems to have finally provided it this is the smoking gun weve all been looking for
540888 it is a tragic event and i have assured the indian prime minister that i would hold an independent inquiry into the incident
540889 all major political parties in pakistan want the cease fire to continue and it is my desire too
540890 i think we should be in a post racial environment
540891 i think sen barack obama has done an admirable job of that i dont think he has race baited i think he has been very good about that
540892 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
540893 oh well i didnt see it i think its kinda stupid
540894 doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
540895 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
540896 not only did we play the race card we dealt it from the bottom of the deck
540897 there is no pride to be had in such efforts

540910 tony blair accused gordon brown of generating hubris and vacuity in a devastating private memo analysing his mistakes which last night threatened to blow a hole in the heart of government the former prime minister believed his successor had presided over a lamentable confusion of tactics and strategy attacking blairs record instead of building on it and failing to spell out an agenda for the future according to the scathing note penned after last septembers chaotic labour party conference such tactics would not win the next election he concluded the note leaked to the mail on sunday newspaper now threatens to trigger open warfare within new labour with its emergence so soon after david milibands broadside against the prime minister which was seen as part of an orchestrated plot to destabilise brown by those loyal to his predecessor it came as blairs close ally and former cabinet minister stephen byers accused browns government of trying to scale a massive electoral mountain with policies more fit for a sunday afternoon stroll in criticisms closely echoing blairs own fears about the lack of a forward looking agenda for new labour byers told the observer it was time for big new ideas to capture voters imagination and claw back marginal seats adding as david miliband said we need to remake our case afresh that means not just obsessing about the question of gordon browns leadership but also considering the policies that will re establish the coalition of support that has won labour three elections loyalist labour mps last night angrily questioned the uncannily close timing of the three bombshells from miliband byers and probably unwittingly blair himself brownites are unlikely to blame the leak on blair who is currently in china and whose spokesman last night insisted he continued to support his successor but the hunt will be on for the undisclosed recipients of the memo who are suspected of deploying it when it could do most damage khalid mahmood mp for birmingham perry barr said at a time when the whole of the labour party is trying to come together it is disappointing that tony blairs friends are trying to cause internal rows with their leaked memos and their personal attacks on gordon tony should tell his friends to stop causing trouble blair is in regular contact with an inner circle of intimates ranging from close political friends such as the european commissioner peter mandelson and former minister alan milburn to former downing street apparatchiks like matthew taylor now running the rsa as well as some serving cabinet ministers including miliband and even brown himself a much edited version of his analysis couched as friendly advice is understood to have been sent to brown later in the year but there is no clue to the recipient of the leaked memo friends said last night that it appeared to have been written at the height of frustration over the bottled snap election when the disarray within the party was well known but never before has blairs anger and dismay at what has happened to his party been so brutally exposed the memo in which blair refers to himself in the third person as tb complains that defining the new leader as a change from the blairite era of spin meant that we dissed our own record a fatal mistake if we do not correct it and also that we junked the tb policy agenda but had nothing to put in its place david camerons own successful party conference was not particularly brilliant but compared with the hubris and vacuity of the conference staged by brown it made the tories look substantial blair writes the memo concludes that brown should have been seen as continuing nl new labour not ditching it adding that by trying to portray himself as a change from blair he played exactly the same game the media wanted but never the game that gives us the only chance of a fourth term blairs spokesman said last night tony blair continues to be 100 per cent supportive of gordon browns government he refused to discuss the memo but its authenticity is in little doubt

540912 the fourteenth amendment provides that no state shall deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of the law we have long recognized that the amendments due process clause like its fifth amendment counterpart guarantees more than fair process the clause includes a substantive component that provides heightened protection against governmental interference with certain fundamental rights and liberty interest
540913 the liberty interest of parents in the care custody and control of their children is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by this court
540914 i do solemnly swear that i will support the constitution of the united states and the constitution of this state and that i will faithfully discharge the duties of the office of according to the best of my ability
540915 i think the negatives of multiple tyres far outweigh the positives
540916 i believe that for racing to be as good as it can be every team should have access to the same tyre and i dont think having different tyres in any form makes the racing better if the race turns into a battle of tyres how does that make better racing i dont think it does
540917 after indy last week you could make the case if another tyre manufacturer was there maybe they would have had something that wouldnt have that trouble but the problem with that would have been that half the field would have had those problems and the other half wouldnt
540918 we had more catastrophic tyre failures and people had contracts with one manufacturer or the other
540919 hoosier lapped the field at north wilkesboro i almost won atlanta in my fourth race as a cup driver because the tyres were so much better
540920 every year we go to indy with the way the surface is
540921 i also heard indy stand up and say they had no blame in it whatsoever thats not true

540936 i would definitely produce and definitely be in the show
540937 i dont know if i need to be the star of this show
540938 the first circle is one of the most important novels of the 20th century and we are thrilled to be making this masterpiece available in its full glory
540939 our point of view remains that consultation is not enough
540940 we could consult and consult to the point of nausea and publishers could still turn around and insist that a book be banded
540941 well over half of the books being published this autumn will have age guidance but all of them have agreement from the authors
540942 i think it was an extraordinary shortlist and it was an honor to be on it
540943 my real children are accepting a prize for my imaginary children
540944 im really looking forward to reading it when im older well done dad
540945 these are the nettles we have been compelled to try and grasp
540946 its an artificial exercise simply because the general public only got to pick from six of the previous winners
540947 the judges were unanimous this is one of those great non fiction books that uses the techniques of fiction to magnificent effect
540948 the average full professor someone who has been teaching for say fifteen years or longer is making five times less than the average president at most institutions works 60 70 hour weeks uses holidays to do research and tries desperately to find time to be a good spouse father mother or partner the life of the mind may seem cushy but it is not
540949 position lots of prestige little dough and each time we talk about whatever todays income is he shakes his head in wonderment
540950 this is awesome im not sure if i can actually believe it
540951 the conditions deteriorated so badly that we werent using that much fuel you could barely use full throttle on a straight line
540952 we couldve gone a lot longer on that tank of fuel but nascar did the right thing the track was just completely flooded this time and it worked out for us
540953 we had a great day going and i just sped down pit lane
540954 i actually took off too early i couldnt see the end of pitlane
540955 im just pretty disappointed that i let everybody down with that i feel robbed about it i feel like we just dominated today controlled the race at the front and its a real shame for the whole team
540956 when it started to rain hard again i had some oil on the window and just couldnt get rid of it
540957 the only thing i could use to drive was the edge of the track and with some speed it was tearing the water a little bit but as soon as we got behind the pace car there the water just stayed on the oil on the windshield and i couldnt see a thing
540958 i wish we wouldve kept going a little longer because i felt we had a good shot at it
540959 but it was great we stayed on track had a good car and ended up second i wanted one position higher this year but i would take second place anytime
540960 i do like our current quarterbacks chad pennington and kellen clemens from almost any aspect
540961 when you see these two gentleman im so happy to have them on the team i think theyre capable of taking us where we have to go
540962 pennington is very smart accurate when hes healthy he doesnt throw picks and hes won a lot of games kellens a little different stylistically but hes also good
540963 i dont know if we have any involvement with favre
540964 i talk to mike four or five times a day its his decision it has to be his decision to run the personnel department i cant start picking out i want this and i want that
540965 i mean i dont go to any game that i dont feel im going to win never i may be overly optimistic even last year i thought we were going to win
540966 we had the opportunity to pick up what we considered to be very good talent and we thought if the talents there why not do it
540967 i think based on what we look like on paper im very optimistic
540968 im very confident that eric and mike and the staffs that theyve put together that theyre building a team both now and continuing to down the road
540969 we feel very strongly that our dna and where we came from is long island
540970 gives us an amazing competitive advantage compared to where we are right now
540971 when i bought the team i said i wanted to put a competitive team on the field and i wanted to move back to new york
540972 so we spent the first six years trying to do that it was a fabulous effort we left no stone unturned
540973 govorio sam ve tijekom sezone da e vedran biti na budu i centarhalf sada e imati priliku dokazati koliko je dobar
540974 dosad je u sredini obrane igrao samo nekoliko minuta protiv chelseaja i to dobro
540975 with the liberal party youre dealing with not a question of personalities its policies
540976 what weve inherited from 12 years of mr costello as treasurer is the second highest interest rates in the developed world together with his being part and parcel of a government which was engaged in climate change denial and work choices
540977 so on that score ive got to say its quite clear cut to me that the liberals whoever their leader is have a real problem with their policy direction for the nations future because of the legacy they left us from the past
540978 once you get it in the bag you can just hit it with a shovel to kill it aim for its neck
540979 who christ shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself
540980 i will defend it because i think a senator or representative can best determine what some of the needs of their community is if those all go by the wayside i think thats going to be too bad
540981 he said all along that health care was a priority and he wasnt kidding
540982 whether you agree or disagree with the governor hes still the governor and he needs to be included in that negotiating process we passed a budget that pretty much excluded him and the legislature sent it over to him and what do we expect
540983 and he said to them suppose one of you shall have a friend and shall go to him at midnight and say to him
540984 do not bother me the door has already been shut and my children and i are in bed i cannot get up and give you anything
540985 and i say to you ask and it shall be given to you seek and you shall find knock and it shall be opened to you for everyone who asks receives and he who seeks finds and to him who knocks it shall be opened
540986 there are hundreds of people all pressing in and you ask who touched you
540987 and seeing them straining at the oars for the wind was against them at about the fourth watch of the night he came to them walking on the sea and he intended to pass by them
540988 a government can simply invoke national security to drive a coach and horses through international anti bribery legislation as the uk government has done to stop corruption investigations
540989 successful attempt by a foreign government to pervert the course of justice in the united kingdom
540990 the director has not given evidence one way or the other about the involvement of prince bandar in the utterance of these threats
540991 now we know where we are under uk law a supposedly independent prosecutor can do nothing to resist a threat made by someone abroad if the uk government claims that the threat endangers national security
540992 the unscrupulous who have friends in high places overseas willing to make such threats now have a get out of jail free card and there is nothing the public can do to hold the government to account if it abuses its national security powers
540993 bae and the government will be quickly disappointed if they think that this ruling will bring an end to public criticism
540994 throughout this case we have been overwhelmed with support from people in all walks of life there has been a sharp rise in opposition to baes influence in the corridors of power
540995 youre so tight i dont want to hurt you i need you so bad ill tear you apart
540996 thats it i can feel you getting tighter for me
540997 probably average to a tick below average second base defense

541078 they have claimed responsibility for attacks against coalition forces and iraqi security forces as early as late 2005

541112 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
541113 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
541114 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
541115 its like god has given me a second chance at life i hope i dont blow it
541116 you dont have to slam the door i will be moved out by monday
541117 i used to do drugs i still do but i used to also
541118 i used to have a crack problem but now i dont smoke it anymore hardly ever that much
541119 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
541120 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
541121 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
541122 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
541123 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
541124 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
541125 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
541126 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
541127 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
541128 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
541129 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
541130 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
541131 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
541132 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
541133 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
541134 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
541135 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
541136 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
541137 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
541138 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
541139 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
541140 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
541141 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
541142 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
541143 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
541144 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
541145 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
541146 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
541147 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
541148 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
541149 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
541150 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
541151 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
541152 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
541153 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
541154 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
541155 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
541156 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
541157 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
541158 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
541159 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
541160 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
541161 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
541162 who are open to doing something on the production side
541163 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
541164 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
541165 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
541166 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
541167 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
541168 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
541169 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
541170 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
541171 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
541172 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
541173 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
541174 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
541175 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
541176 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
541177 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
541178 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
541179 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
541180 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
541181 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
541182 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
541183 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
541184 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
541185 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
541186 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
541187 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
541188 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
541189 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
541190 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
541191 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
541192 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
541193 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
541194 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
541195 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
541196 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
541197 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
541198 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
541199 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
541200 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
541201 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
541202 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
541203 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
541204 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
541205 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
541206 realise all your dreams with our help for a short time
541207 they were however in semi good health not kept in a dungeon or anything but not able to leave at will either
541208 we heard some noise outside and then the door literally burst in and the dea came in in full combat gear told everybody to get on the floor and put their hands behind their heads
541209 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time

541213 el escenario que genera la crisis mundial de alimentos puede y debe ser aprovechado por nuestro pa s
541214 las oportunidades de los sectores concentrados no pueden excluir al resto de los argentinos y condicionar nuestra seguridad alimentaria

541216 la sociedad rural no est para sacar y nombrar a los funcionarios de agricultura tampoco para dictar las pol ticas agropecuarias como hicieron en otros tiempos como dice miguens esas s eran pol ticas arbitrarias
541217 la dirigencia que a o tras a o se nuclea en el predio de palermo no debe inquietarse por carecer del manejo de las pol ticas p blicas
541218 los argentinos hoy tenemos un gobierno que gobierna un gobierno que mantiene una visi n de desarrollo productivo integral y distribuci n de la riqueza que deja de lado el ego smo

541224 ya es hora de que la sociedad rural deje de apoyarse en las leyes que dise el ex ministro de econom a de la ltima dictadura militar jos alfredo mart nez de hoz para salvaguardar la especulaci n de las grandes exportadoras de cereales
541225 cuestionan la resoluci n 543 de la oncca porque ha sido la nica herramienta efectiva con la pudimos r pidamente combatir la elusi n fiscal que la ley de granos les permite
541226 es hora de cambios y los ruralistas de palermo deben comprender que el pago de los derechos de exportaci n ya no puede ser un componente m s de la especulaci n en el comercio de granos cereales y oleaginosas
541227 l stima que los ruralistas de palermo no tienen en cuenta qu algunos de sus socios en 2007 exportaron 90 por ciento de su producci n a para sos fiscales como m naco islas v rgenes e islas caim n
541228 la aduana estableci que 86 por ciento del aceite de soja a granel tambi n fue facturado a para sos fiscales
541229 80 por ciento de las exportaciones de harina de soja tuvieron estos mismos destinos

541231 youre under arrest for the sexual assault of michelle clark
541232 and if you think that being the son of a sheriffs commander made you popular at school just wait until you get to prison shifting to a playful tone convicts play some of the same games as you and your best buds i imagine youll end up in their cherry picking club in no time at all
541233 it really sets forth with clarity various foreign policy ideals that we have as democrats it incorporates new ideas on education both k through 12 and higher education the platform on energy is very strong and the connection between a new energy future and a new economic future for the country
541234 its important that her voice and her overall policies are included and ive seen that over the last few days and its been important to her and her followers that you are seeing in this first draft of the platform very specific references to issues she has cared about and how she talked about it
541235 when shes talked about people who are invisible when she talks about the sandwich generation when she talks about middle class working people and empowering them to work
541236 its time we stop just talking about family values and start pursuing policies that truly value families families are increasingly responsible for caring for children and aging relatives and its sic time for the government to meet them halfway
541237 she has been saying nothing but very good things about senator obama and you know i think it is important that he reaches out to her frankly and to her supporters because she won almost 49 percent of the vote and i think she is and 18 million people are important
541238 its a part of conciliation its part of reconciliation but i totally see it particularly ironically amongst the candidates she long ago said lets look forward not backwards and it is helpful to her to be able to point to specific things for example in this platform there are signals of reaching out
541239 we talk nuance word choice all the rest but the goals of a revitalized economy a strong military an emphasis on education and education for the 21st century leading into new types of jobs that we need to have
541240 these are shared values in the party and that is what is coming on to the platform
541241 i think fairness in the selection of the nominee is always an issue to the democratic party but the process itself is congressional in nature and not part of this platform right now
541242 it must be obvious to everyone who hasnt got a vested interest in supplements that the cochrane antioxidant review is absolute rubbish it contains fundamental flaws
541243 sponsorship of a cochrane review by any commercial source or sources as defined above is prohibited
541244 effectively to represent the interests of the specialist health product sector
541245 inadequate levels of vitamins and minerals in the blood reduce a childs iq
541246 supplementation by vitamin and mineral pills can raise the childs non verbal iq significantly
541247 has no effect on children with an adequate level of vitamins and mineral
541248 when i was growing up nasa inspired the world with achievements were still proud of
541249 today we have an administration that sets ambitious goals for nasa without giving nasa the support it needs to reach them
541250 i know its still being reported that we were talking about delaying some aspects of the constellation program to pay for our early education program
541251 i told my staff were going to find an entirely different offset because weve got to make sure that the money thats going into nasa for basic research and development continues to go there that has been a top priority for us
541252 the constellation project is a bold vision but we havent thought through all the steps to get there and what the funding sources are
541253 the only thing barack obama knows about sending a man to the moon is that its a good applause line
541254 obamas plans to cut nasa funding and delay scientific exploration are indicative of his inexperience with space policy
541255 barack obama understands how critical nasa is to americas scientific and economic edge
541256 that is why we have an alternative offset to pay for his early edcuation plan by reforming and reducing earmark spending reforming federal contracting procedures
541257 but we are handling this in a very serious manner
541258 more times than not hes had our number to get on a guy like that it just shows it was our day at the plate
541259 i dont know if i could try to go out there and give up 14 hits
541260 it seems like i was making some pitches and they were hitting them and then there were times when i was missing my spots and they were hitting them pretty hard it just was one of those days
541261 i dont care how many griffeys we bring in here weve got to start pitching better you got to go out there and do it
541262 after the konerko home run i kind of stepped off the mound and said ok take a breather
541263 theyre built for the home run and they do hit them
541264 you get to where youre completely soaked and you keep going into the dugout and drying out
541265 as soon as you get back on the mound youre drenched again

541268 whats the purpose here mr hamdan is going to be held until the government wants to release him
541269 its not necessarily james bond like spying where you have some super spy penetrating the deepest u s secrets
541270 its trying relentlessly to get defense related technology from u s companies u s engineers and the u s military
541271 he is totally unable to lie it is not his nature hes as honest and truthful and trusting as they come
541272 the reason most people are so miserable is that they cant stand themselves
541273 you could make a lot of money selling this stuff
541274 in colloquial language people living in ethnically diverse settings appear to hunker down that is to pull in like a turtle
541275 to withdraw even from close friends to expect the worst from their community and its leaders to volunteer less give less to charity and work on community projects less often to register to vote less to agitate for social reform more but have less faith that they can actually make a difference and to huddle unhappily in front of the television
541276 may underestimate the real effect of diversity on social withdrawal
541277 seem fully as unnerved by diversity as those raised in the 1920s
541278 the last hope of human liberty in this world rests on us we ought for so dear a stake to sacrifice every attachment amp every enmity

541315 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews they believe that tradition says that the prophet mohammed fought against the jews and that therefore they must continue to fight them to the death they have to take revenge against anyone who did not agree to accept the prophet mohammed like the jews who are seen in the koran as monkeys and the sons of pigs they speak in terms of historical rights that were taken from them in the view of hamas peace with israel contradicts sharia and the koran and the jews have no right to remain in palestine
541316 more than that an entire society sanctifies death and the suicide terrorists in palestinian culture a suicide terrorist becomes a hero a martyr sheikhs tell their students about the heroism of the shaheeds and that causes the young people to imitate the suicide bombers in order to achieve glory ill give you an example i once met a young man named dia tawil he was a quiet boy an outstanding student not a muslim extremist and not radical in his ideas against the israelis i never heard extreme statements from him he didnt even come from a religious family his father was a communist and his sister was a journalist who didnt wear a head covering but bilal barghouti one of the heads of the military arm of hamas in the west bank didnt need more than a few months to convince him to become a suicide terrorist

541325 it is unfortunate that people sometimes have unrealistic expectations in romantic relationships
541326 it felt good to just show the team that i can do it and give them some confidence in me so in the game when i do have a chance to have a game winner they expect me to make it and they are not thinking flip a coin
541327 i maybe got a little bit more confidence out of the team and a little more confidence in myself
541328 thats impressive but ive been around this game a long time and i know not to evaluate people until theyre in game time situations
541329 i think we got a lot done the players now have about a day and a half off well deserved
541330 we saw what was happening and stood on the side and did not get involved
541331 at 5 p m a group tried approaching the fence at nahal oz we saw that some of them were wounded and we decided to allow them to bring the wounded and evacuate them into israel
541332 todays security operation was directed against one of the biggest mafias in the gaza strip
541333 hamas wont allow any party or individual to establish a mini state inside the gaza strip
541334 we left our homes to save the lives of women and children who came under attack by the bloody hamas gangsters
541335 hamas has once again proven that it is a treacherous party that has a lot of palestinian blood on its hands
541336 whats happening in the gaza strip is a real massacre against innocent people
541337 whats happening is part of a well planned scheme to consolidate the divisions among the palestinians
541338 they just found the first three skinheads and brought them to the court without any real evidence
541339 i think if you did a survey of 100 people and asked them if they wanted the ban lifted almost all of them would say no
541340 its true they did spend a lot of cash in bars and restaurants but i think the owners of these establishments are just happy to have a quiet life without the added hassle or threat of violence hanging over them
541341 the base itself does contribute to the employment market because locals take jobs there but on an individual basis the soldiers arent really seen as contributing anything positive
541342 from time to time we have incidents but these are normal fights that happen all over the world to suggest there is a bad relationship creates a negative picture that does not reflect reality
541343 the ban is a matter for the army it has nothing to do with cypriots

541349 when i saw the thousands of submissions to the commission by consumers and the standing room only fcc field hearings that we attended and in some cases testified at that part surprised me
541350 that there were that many people paying this much attention to this
541351 however in terms of enforcement this is a first in the world as far as i know
541352 the commissions order raises significant due process concerns and a variety of substantial legal questions
541353 we are considering all our legal options and are disappointed that the commission rejected our attempts to settle this issue without further delays
541354 no demands yet i dont think they know what they want weve got prints communications set up just waiting on your sorry butt the security set up is older and theres no way to tap it with out being inside the building so how are we going to get them out

541356 good now listen carefully tell me how many robbers there are but not in numbers use the days of the week like sunday is one understand

541358 ill call back in thirty minutes on the dot pearl this phone is like an office line if they want to talk before the thirty minutes is up just pick up the receiver and press any of the lines it will ring straight to me no one else will answer it okay
541359 pearl have they settled on something we can make a deal with
541360 alright they are sending them out now but you have to fall back
541361 we can do that ill stay on the phone with you till the three hostages are in custody

541367 theres a rich history of baseball here and it just seemed like the right thing to do
541368 all of us know we do not live on a river an ocean we dont have a theme park and we have to be creative in the way we bring in out of town dollars to our city
541369 so why not build on our sports tourism this would be another way we can make all the other pieces of the puzzle with tourism fit by making gillette more of a destination
541370 all of our investment will soon make this baseball complex the envy of all those around i look forward to seeing all of you on opening day
541371 the development of a facility such as this does not just happen
541372 it takes elected officials and appointed leaders with vision and a deep appreciation for their community to promote and fund a project of this quality this project only enhances a department that already has an excellent reputation across the state

541389 his message to the jews was dont be afraid sichon and og were tremendous giants who lived at the border of the promised land in their role as protectors of the canaanite kings the source of their strength was the angels who had fathered them they were angels who had protested the creation of man because they were angels they were unable to grasp that man by overcoming his physical nature was in fact stronger than the angels by defeating sichon and og in battle moses showed the jews that one who keeps the torah can overcome the canaanite kings and all they represent as well
541390 the opening words of moshe in dvarim are a recount of the disappointing events surrounding their 40 years of wandering the people are poised to go into the land but first their past actions warrants a personal rebuke told in first person from moshe hence our connection to the rebuke of the haftarah portion
541391 ordinarily we attribute moses and aarons punishment with the sin of striking the rock at meribah num 20 the incident with the spies however predates the sin of moses and aaron at the waters of meribah by 38 years thirty eight years before the crime of striking the rock was committed their sentence was passed a generation before they committed the sin their punishment was announced perhaps the punishment was as much a justification for the sentence that they were already under as it was a punishment for striking the rock such is the fate of the righteous though they do not share in the sin of their generation they often share in its punishment the destiny of moses was sealed with that of the people he led

541438 n s ainda estamos fazendo a montagem do filme pegando os efeitos da ilm e depois iremos mostr lo para a alta c pula da paramount provavelmente no final de agosto estamos realmente realmente animados sobre o que conseguimos acho que o filme realmente funciona ent o creio que iremos apenas p r as cenas de efeitos especiais agora isso uma das coisas que nos faz manter a programa o de deixar o filme pronto no natal de modo que n s iremos nos sentar sobre isso por enquanto
541439 acho que alguns efeitos est o parcialmente prontos ent o se voc est olhando para uma tela panor mica voc v o espa o l fora mas o espa o n o est totalmente renderizado digitaliza o de imagens nem existem quaisquer elementos os planetas s o os nicos toda uma intera o como se estivesse assistindo miguelangelo esculpir davi um bloco ent o ele est levemente come ando a tomar a forma humana isto quer dizer que nada est feito por causa do simples tamanho da coisa essa a raz o porque voc n o v os rob s de transformers at seis meses antes do filme come ar
541440 eu acho que para n s o filme est em geral capturando o mundo de jornada um mundo no qual existe uma federa o de planetas os personagens s o do tipo intercambi veis neste mundo eu entraria num longo debate com algu m que dissesse gostar de a nova gera o e detestar a s rie original por que isso ambas as s ries funcionam no mesmo universo obedecem as mesmas regras e est o situadas num futuro que otimista e aventureiro e elas s o s ries de explora o ent o seria dif cil dizer para os f s se voc gostou de deep space nine provavelmente n o gostar do filme mas se gostou de voyager voc ir ador lo n o pode separar as s ries at onde sei eu vi mais a nova gera o que a s rie cl ssica apenas porque eu estava mais pr xima a ela eu cresci vendo a

541451 creio que abrams criou o qual fizemos parte do nascimento desses personagens e tamb m da constru o desse relacionamento e como isso leva a miss o de cinco anos
541452 acho que eles fizeram um incr vel trabalho de elenco quando as pessoas virem o que zach quinto fez com seu personagem o que karl urban fez com o seu e zoe com uhura e ela realmente expandiu muito este personagem creio que ficar o surpresas
541453 trazer nossa pr pria responsabilidade sobre o papel eu creio que abriu um grande n mero de possibilidades n o sei como pensa zach mas eu nunca me senti particularmente endividado s agrade o a deus por nos ter dado uma funda o para esses personagens o lado positivo disso que abrams deixa nos fazer o que queremos o que o sr shatner fez foi algo espec fico nico para ele e tudo o que eu fiz foi tentar fazer justi a ao que ele criou mas tentar imit lo n o teria sido inteligente
541454 embora eu n o tenha sido um grande f da s rie eu a assisti e sabia a respeito dela apenas a imagem do capit o kirk em sua cadeira ic nico mesmo que voc n o seja f voc sabe quem ele e ao ver essa camisa dourada sabe o que est assistindo

541507 i have to say i could never bring myself to dislike the guy ambassador alvaro de soto the former un special coordinator for the middle east peace process and since his resignation a harsh critic of many aspects of olmerts performance wrote me earlier today he may have been a dismal commander in chief but he articulated the depth of the challenge facing israel with astonishing candor
541508 olmerts greatest failure was his inability to stand up to generals in the cabinet room after soldiers were kidnapped on the northern border in the summer of 2006 generals with contingency plans maps and reassurances political professional that he was he was loathe to be thought outside the consensus established by military professionals also by outdated zionist institutions american jewish moguls and a tabloid press he told some journalists after the lebanon war that this was his bay of pigs implying that he had been ensnared by an inherited security establishment he said he would need three years for people to forget the debacle and credit his peace moves alas he is no jack kennedy

541514 we just took his tow the barge is right in front of us and were running it over
541515 look at the three big policy challenges were wrestling with at the moment
541516 on the economy the liberal party left us with interest rates the second highest in the developed world inflation at a 16 year high and 10 successive interest rate increases and beyond that on climate change 12 years of neglect and denial and the only thing they believed in workchoices
541517 the key question on the future of the country is are you fair dinkum about long term economic leadership and what weve inherited from 12 years of costello as treasurer are the facts and figures i ran through before including the second highest interest rates in the world
541518 together with his being part and parcel of a government that was engaged in climate change denial and workchoices and mr costello among the others was wanting to take workchoices even further so on that score ive got to say it is quite clear cut that the liberals whoever their leader is have a real policy problem with their direction for the nations future because of the legacy they left us in the past
541519 this is a guy that whenever hes been wooed hes never consented and whenever hes chased hes never succeeded
541520 hes also the treasurer that has had a manic obsession in terms of pursuing an agenda that really cost the previous government a lot in the last election workchoices
541521 there is no harder job than being leader of an opposition its tough its unrelenting you have my total goodwill my total support
541522 peter costello has earned the right to make the decision about his future with his own family in the best interests of both them and the people of higgins

541700 ethnic cleansing created more than two million refugees and displaced persons in former yugoslavia during the war in bosnia this number increased with the expulsion of serbs from croatia and with the ferocious atrocities committed by serbs against the albanian majority in kosovo prior and during in spite of nato air strikes
541701 as i have said countles times before though oppression and injustice does normaly lead to violence
541702 abbiamo bisogno di anticipare una reazione per mantenere il rapporto sociale
541703 un mondo simile porterebbe alla follia ma penso che lo stesso si possa dire di un mondo che funziona solo tramite convenzioni
541704 il problema e che luomo non e fatto per ridefinire velocemente in questo modo qualsiasi contesto
541705 se non potessimo affidarci ai ruoli e agli stereotipi saremmo privati della griglia fondamentale

541710 due to the late date of the two parties nominating conventions and the relatively short period between the end of the conventions and the first proposed date it is likely that the four commission debates will be the sole series of debates in the fall campaign
541711 we understand it might be beneath a worldwide john mccain and directly answer questions from the american people but we hope hell reconsider
541712 were at war our economy is in turmoil and weve got so many challenges that the people of this country deserve a serious discourse and it shouldnt be limited necessarily to three kind of very regimented debates in the fall
541713 we ought to begin sooner and we ought to have a free flowing conversation about where we want to take this country
541714 untuk menghancurkan negara dan bangsa tidak perlu menggunakan bom bisa dengan menyebarkan virus berbahaya hal itu dapat memusnahkan kehidupan warganya terutama anak muda dan bayi di bawah usia lima tahun
541715 kita perlu 30 perusahaan saja ini sesuai anggaran yang ada
541716 saat ini mencari kerja sulit karena lahan pekerjaaan sedikit sementara pencari kerja terus bertambah banyak perusahaan memilih karyawan outsource karena lebih murah dan tidak mendapat tunjangan seperti karyawan tetap hubungan kerja dapat diputus sewaktu waktu bila user tidak puas dengan hasil kerja tanpa melewati prosedur rumit
541717 alasan lain adalah lebih ketat dan sulitnya proses rekrutmen untuk menyaring tenaga kerja potensial seperti di tempat kerja saya rekrutmen menjadi karyawan tetap harus melalui proses pendidikan mdp management development program selama 1 tahun bagi lulusan s 1 atau ppa program pendidikan akutansi selama 3 tahun bagi lulusan smu sederajat untuk dapat bekerja
541718 pekerjaan terbatas tapi sdm meningkat menyebabkan sulit mendapatkan pekerjaan yang sesuai dengan keinginan standar gaji terlalu tinggi juga menyebabkan mereka yang sudah berpengalaman susah mendapat pekerjaan baru selain itu ada faktor pendukung suatu perusahaan mengambil keputusan yaitu leadership teamwork can work underpressure dan creative
541719 segudang pengalaman bukan jaminan untuk mendapat pekerjaan yang sesuai dengan keinginan ada banyak faktor yang dilihat perusahaan dalam mempekerjakan seseorang be yourself karena dari cara bicara bisa dilihat apakah seseorang bicara apa adanya jangan mengumbar kata kata indah saat interview jika hanya akan menjadi bumerang buat diri sendiri
541720 sudah punya pengalaman kerja tapi kok tetap susah cari kerja ini bisa disebabkan karena orang ini memilih milih tempat kerja barunya biasanya ia akan mencari perusahaan yang punya reputasi bisa memberinya gaji lebih besar dan jabatan lebih tinggi bagaimana bisa mendapat pekerjaan dalam waktu cepat kalau maunya semua kriteria itu bisa terpenuhi
541721 belum lagi hal buruk yang pernah ia temui di tempat kerja sebelumnya akan sangat diminimalisir ia takkan mau mendapatkan lagi misalnya bos yang cerewet gaji yang kelewat kecil dan lain sebagainya be realistic saja kerjakan saja apa yang bisa dikerjakan dan tetap bersyukur pada tuhan kadang kadang rumput tetangga memang terlihat lebih hijau
541722 our marketing campaign for china is the largest we have ever done in a single country
541723 we see this as a marketing platform that will help us to achieve market leadership in china this year

541746 that would have been too much if i got up and down from there
541747 i played in college and i played all right i was a decent player but just kept working at it and finally it took me like man 15 years to get my pga tour card but i finally did it and then got my lunch handed to me out there so i was already 45 years old when i did it so i said maybe well just wait for the next level and here i am
541748 hes still playing great it happens in every sport when someone sets the bar so high guys find a way of creeping up behind you
541749 i dont think theres a huge difference between a semifinal and a final but to win it would be huge

541756 zulaman does have a fairly steep curve in difficulty but having only two 10 person dungeons makes it so having a challenge like this in clearing it makes sense this can also be seen as an example of why having separate progression paths for 10 and 25 person dungeons in wrath of the lich king will likely work out better this dungeon can also be a pretty clear example of how badge of justice gear that you gather from running karazhan and zulaman can help get a group prepared to take things on
541757 whenever weve been able to meet and interact with blizzard gamers from around the world its been a great experience for us
541758 were looking forward to seeing even more of our players at this years blizzcon and delivering another entertaining and informative event for them

541760 if the average personal rating of the players queuing for a game is more than 150 points below the teams rating the team will be queued against an opponent matching or similar to the average personal rating
541761 if a team does not enter an arena match that is starting they will lose points equal to the amount that would have been deducted if they had played and lost
541762 we are excited to bring an event this large of scale to the world of warcraft tcg players around the world who have dedicated themselves to the game

541772 twenty years ago 21 of oil contracts were purchased by speculators who trade oil on paper with no intention of ever taking delivery today oil speculators purchase 66 of all oil futures contracts and that reflects just the transactions that are known speculators buy up large amounts of oil and then sell it to each other again and again a barrel of oil may trade 20 plus times before it is delivered and used the price goes up with each trade and consumers pick up the final tab some market experts estimate that current prices reflect as much as 30 to 60 per barrel in unnecessary speculative costs
541773 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
541774 we see this as a pilot project that could explode across the city
541775 prices have gone up so much now a kilo 2 2 lbs of tomatoes costs 17 pesos before it was 6

541780 seriously seeking to increase the size of joint investments to more than 3 billion over the next years
541781 comments of that nature come from a biased reading of reality
541782 were simply a political team that has worked for a long time with the same vision and common ideas about the society we want
541783 should be taken up as an instrument of economic policy
541784 i have to confess that ive never followed an election campaign in the united states with such interest

541799 quero destacar a firme convic o de quem fala ela e do presidente lula de que a integra o importante na vis o dos dois pa ses
541800 o assunto em doha era o que colocavam os pa ses desenvolvidos nessa negocia o e o que os pa ses emergentes colocavam mas n o era um bom neg cio para os pa ses emergentes e especificamente para a rep blica argentina com um desenvolvimento industrial inferior diferente do que tem o brasil
541801 hoje por suas pol ticas constantes o brasil tem uma empresa como a embraer e n s n o temos nada por isso temos que aplicar medidas que sejam permanentes no tempo
541802 a import ncia da argentina como um pa s altamente competitivo
541803 recentemente o presidente da fiesp federa o das ind strias do estado de s o paulo paulo skaf disse numa entrevista a um jornal argentino que a argentina hoje muito mais competitiva que o brasil na hora de se investir
541804 e isso tamb m muito importante para a integra o
541805 e tamb m quero ressaltar a visita do presidente ch vez acho que a integra o da venezuela ao mercosul algo mais que importante especialmente num momento em que o mundo discute energia pre os e alimentos
541806 voltaria a fazer todas as coisas que fiz e tamb m diria que voltaria a aplicar a resolu o 125
541807 quando kirchner chegou presid ncia em 2003 tamb m diziam que eu mandava que eu chamava os ministros que eu gritava com eles
541808 mas n s dois somos militantes h muito tempo e defendemos com id ias a sociedade que melhor queremos para a argentina para nossos filhos
541809 im the lord of the lords not the servant of the serfs
541810 the course is playing great the pins were a little easier than they were yesterday and the greens were a little softer
541811 the pins were just not as crazy i think the usga kind of listened to some guys and they did a good job with the setup
541812 some of them yesterday were on the side of slopes and if you got anywhere above the wrong side of the hole you were going to be 20 feet past no matter what
541813 today they are a lot more accessible but they are still tough
541814 i think tomorrow the key is going to be the front nine the group of guys that goes out there and lights it up on the front
541815 i started playing good two months ago im doing very well my putter is working now when i miss well im still with good concentration but im happy with my putting
541816 if i win tomorrow first of all its a dream for me
541817 but also to win the tournament tomorrow is very important for latin america and argentina
541818 i love coming to colorado and when i saw the course i was licking my chops
541819 its detailed i spend so much time on the course that i get to know it better than i ever could which is good for my caddying
541820 i can do some other things that hopefully will help us on the greens it is a side business but its also beneficial for fred the better i know things the better i can help him
541821 i dont think anybody else is looking at the course for 25 30 hours
541822 when there are significant mounds in the fairway that gets tough too i dont put a lot of fairway slopes in just obvious ones but when you have to have it in there that adds a lot of time
541823 but bunkers and water hazards take a lot of time because i have to walk around every one its worth it when freds playing
541824 i had some other guys that wanted to caddie but i wanted a guy that was here and played the course
541825 i knew the greens were difficult to read and home course knowledge is important here
541826 i told him he would have to wear a nebraska hat tomorrow
541827 he told me i was fired and i need to take it off
541828 i just like to have fun out there and he does too
541829 im not one of those guys that likes to just keep your head down and grind and be intense we have a lot of fun and talk a lot and laugh a lot that helps
541830 im catching up on some sleep so i feel rested first part of the week it was hard to sleep not only the time change but i kept waking up with flashbacks
541831 the santander group wanted to sell the bank to a venezuelan businessperson who asked for permission like the law requires but now i say no we are going to recuperate the bank of venezuela for all the people since this is a country that is recuperating its wealth in order to put it at the service of the people
541832 has since gained knowledge of the interest of the venezuelan government in the bank of venezuela being in this moment in conversations to that effect
541833 sure will not be anything conflictive or generate any problems
541834 will act with total respect for the procedures established by our laws and with due respect to the current stockholders of the bank of venezuela
541835 starting right this moment the media war against me will begin they will try to brand me an autocrat who wants to break up relations with spain once again
541836 to those who have their savings in the bank dont worry you will be more than guaranteed in the hands of the republic
541837 you know the banking sector of venezuela is one of the most solid in the world
541838 the profit will not be of one group but to invest in socialist development
541839 people are willing to do tedious complex tasks within games
541840 we want to use the power of these games to transform information work
541841 bluetooth earpieces for phones are mainstream now but bluetooth headsets are not why dont the zune ipod sandisk sansa and all the other mp3 players out there offer bluetooth could it be because most people dont know how to download an hp bluetooth stack or play around with avrcp and manipulate similar files the people who read articles like this one are the early adopters we are the guinea pigs we are playing around with cutting edge technology and in order to be able to use it we have to accept that this technology may not work right out of the box
541842 if it turns out to be of any size this particular outage would be only the latest in a recent spate rim has suffered and not even the first past month
541843 what were you talking to me i had my headphones on
541844 we think it is necessary to visualize a world that is opening itself
541845 multilateralism will be nothing more than the expression of the birth and consolidation of a new multi polar era which some like to call pluripolar and others call poly centric but that definitively is an era aspired to and desired by many for centuries
541846 the most important effort of the peoples to constitute an instance of dialogue brotherhood and respect and to share the plural search for a new world without empires without colonialism without exclusions without racism without dominations of any kind
541847 we support multilateralism but multilateralism with respect for international laws
541848 the transformation of the united nations and its integral reform
541849 hopefully something good will happen in that country and the people will wake up and extend their hand in terms of respect and equality to the people of the world
541850 bring an end to the doctrine of war and hegemony that has brought so much death
541851 only with our own efforts will we be able to construct a world of hope and peace

541864 investigators determined that clark rockefeller and reigh were staying in an apartment in close proximity to a facility known as the anchorage marina where clark was docking his 26ft unnamed catamaran
541865 investigators used this information to create a ruse to lure clark from to apartment to the marina by placing a call to him and telling him his boat was taking on water
541866 when clark left the apartment he was immediately placed under arrest by fbi agents reigh was located alone in the apartment

541872 i thought hospice meant that i was being sent to an institution to die i did not know that hospice was a service i could get at home
541873 we havent met the goals we want to meet as far as the grant but it is a remarkable increase
541874 the biggest barrier to progress is that many people dont know what hospice truly is due to equal parts of language barriers cultural taboos and the fear of talking about death and dying
541875 our goal is to teach people that providing hospice care for a loved one is a loving gesture governed by the principle that every person has the right to die in a dignified and nurturing environment surrounded by those they love
541876 everyone who has come here from hospice care network has been wonderful to me
541877 i had heard of hospice before but was concerned about how well it worked
541878 my mother was able to continue living in the adult residence in flushing that is where hospice care network cared for her
541879 i want to wish you a merry christmas and all the best in the new year enjoy the festive season remember christmas is about giving not receiving christmas is a time to show your love and generosity to others especially your mum dad sisters brothers and family and to those less fortunate than yourself peace on earth and good will to all men

541886 tim spent his life travelling and meeting new people and always saw the good in everyone
541887 he was a little guy with a heart bigger than you could know

541892 that was unusual for him not to call back and then when he didnt show up for work on tuesday we got worried
541893 and then when i found out in the news that li was being pinned for the brutal attack i was in utter shock
541894 i never knew tim and his family but i wish all the best in this awful time
541895 the outpouring of well wishes from complete strangers has been overwhelming
541896 the family appreciates all the love and support from friends loved ones and the public nationwide

541906 im glad we didnt wreck im proud of my guys they did a good job having the car ready for the rain i just wished it wouldnt have started raining so hard and we could have raced a little longer
541907 i feel like we really dominated todays race i made an error down pit lane i just couldnt see the pit exit and we sped
541908 we obviously had the best car for these track conditions
541909 that was really pleasing this was my first experience in the rain ever the car was pretty good everything was going really well then we pitted and got that penalty
541910 its my kind of racing but you really need to be set up right and the tires as old as they are theyre a little hard so was zero grip out there
541911 all in all im surprised how well everyone did and how few accidents there were in the end people were wrecking under caution because you just couldnt see

541923 always price compare and look at the individual components to be sure that it really is a good deal and not last years tech at low low prices
541924 consumers tend to end up on the short side though as most failures will happen long after the warranty periods and by the time they do the items in question are outdated the money can be better saved for future replacement costs even organizations such as consumer reports recommend against purchasing such warranties

541934 saya bersama pak rektor ke istambul turki itu dalam rangka mewakili indonesia untuk mengikuti rangkaian kegiatan imma yaitu consorsium pendidikan kedokteran islam selain itu juga meninjau dan mengiplementasikan rencana kerjasama dengan fatiq university yang isinya mempersiapkan munculnya dokter muslim karena dinilai bahwa perlu ada suatu usaha untuk menciptakan rambu rambu bagaimana sebenarnya dokter muslim yang dikehendaki sebagaimana dikehendaki oleh agama islam
541935 jadi pertemuan tersebut merupakan pertemuan yang kesekian kalinya dan unissula telah mengikutinya sejak 2002 namun untuk kegiatan consorsium pendidikan kedokteran ini mulai aktif pada tahun 2005 yang diadakan di yaman
541936 tantangannya sebagaimana yang telah ada di negara negara sekuler seperti di turki di mana di negara tersebut terjadi adanya pemisahan antara agama dengan bidang yang lainnya selain itu yang dihadapi oleh kedokteran islam adalah masalah umum yaitu masalah kebebasan moral yang terjadi di dunia barat yang begitu bebasnya masuk ke negara islam hal itu otomatis penyakit penyakit yang ditimbulkan berhubungan dengan masalah kebebasan moral itu yang akan menjangkiti masyarakat
541937 ya bisa dikatakan tokoh tokoh itu merupakan suatu rujukan tapi rujukan utama bagi seorang dokter muslim adalah sebagaimana yang diajarkan al quran dan hadits selain itu juga harus memiliki etika dan moral yang bisa mencirikan dia sebagai seorang dokter yang muslim yang baik
541938 ingin menerapkan atau ingin mencetak seorang dokter yang menguasai bidang ilmu kedokteran sesuai dengan kemajuan ilmu pengetahuan dan teknologi dan tetap mengimplementasikan nilai nilai islam di dalamnya untuk membawakan kerahmatan manusia dan tetap pada landasan landasan moral dan ahklak
541939 aktivis tidak harus organisatoris asal memiliki perhatian besar terhadap permasalahan sekitar tidak bisa diam jika ada sesuatu yang tidak beres itulah aktivis
541940 hal ini merupakan bukti nyata bahwa kepercayaan publik dan masyarakat terhadap unissula yang berkah dan melimpah
541941 where can i get my all hu akbar license plate
541942 why are you spending an extra 20 on a vanity license plate when you could spend it on some sort of real evangelism
541943 to do something that has a big budget a great scope with a great director and great actors that has the quality and level of writing and the level of production design is a once in a lifetime opportunity
541944 any actor in his right mind would want to do this film would die to do it
541945 because hes been ill for quite a while like they say when a man is about 80 years and there have been symptoms of ill health he is expected to hear the call no matter how much we wish hed stayed longer
541946 he was not in pains though he was just indisposed
541947 i cant make that sharp distinction because he was always everything he influenced us in many ways careers religion and every sphere of our lives he was everything to us and we were so close to him well miss everything about him
541948 hes already immortalised himself he lived a good life and built a good name for himself and the family
541949 jose lived a full and exemplary life he was an institution in journalism politics and leadership in islam our hearts are broken allah will bless his soul
541950 the death of alhaji jose has robbed nigeria of a media icon a statesman and a nationalist par excellence
541951 though at 82 one would want to admit that alhaji jose was old it is a shock to learn that he has passed on giving that he has remained a reference point for media practice in nigeria
541952 jose remains the father of modern day journalism there is no medium that youll not find a product of jose in charge he exhibited courage and was a stickler to the best of ethics of journalism in the country so in death he is a fulfilled man because he lived to see many of his products rise to the highest level in all aspects of life
541953 jose was a devoted muslim leader who stood very strongly for the unity of the country and promoted decency in every sphere of life he was also a true patriot what was remarkable about him is the way he mentored the young especially in journalism
541954 jose was an outstanding leader in journalism he set standards in professional journalism which would be difficult for anybody to match amuka pemu said the legacy left behind by jose would be cherished by all he lived a good life and the legacy he left behind will be cherished by all journalists he trained many journalists and i am one of his products
541955 then he remains one individual whose ideals are worth emulating he would not only be missed by journalists but everyone who truly seeks to live uprightly
541956 while we received the news of his death with shock we are consoled by his legacies especially the path of honour truth and courage he laid for the nigerian press
541957 he meant everything to everyone in the journalism profession i myself am a product of joses training school
541958 jose had the chieftaincy title of bobatolu of ikare and by that he and myself shared the responsibility of ensuring the development of our birth place and by extension the nigerian society
541959 all journalists should learn to work very hard like him we have learnt from him that with hard work dedication and commitment the sky is the limit for every conscientious journalist he said
541960 it is about direct action outside the camp we will break the law or do whatever needs to take place to stop e on peacefully from profiting from climate change last year they made 4 2 billion in profit from creating climate change
541961 we are planning to shut the coal fired power station down and we are planning to come back when they create a new coal fired power station because we are the last generation that can do it and if we dont then there is no future for any of us
541962 theres little doubt that if we burn all of the coal that sits below the earths surface we can return the planet to the condition it was in 50 million years ago when the antarctic was a tropical forest and much of the rest of the planet would be pretty difficult for human beings to live on
541963 weve got to see that coal is not a useful resource to burn unless we can recapture the carbon that is produced by burning it
541964 we therefore need to work positively towards carbon capture and storage if we can manage that then of course we can continue to use coal to drive our economies but frankly i havent seen the proof that that can be done
541965 this is still unproven technology and i think until its proven its dangerous to assume that we can continue to use coal
541966 i think those power stations are going to be priced out of the market as carbon dioxide pricing goes up so i quite simply dont think its a good private sector decision to invest in coal fired power stations
541967 this decision on kingsnorth is a political tipping point because if we dont say no to unabated coal here how can we say anything to china and india no one will respect the uks opinion
541968 the real prize is to develop technologies so that the ccs technology can be retro fitted onto coal fired plants in countries like china
541969 our decisions about any one application for a coal plant in britain are pretty small fry compared to the risk of global co2 emissions in coming years
541970 the government has been very feeble about investing in research into ccs
541971 it has now got a competition rather belatedly for the industry to try to come up with this technology
541972 the fact is we have known for years that we need it but instead they are actually considering approving a new coal fired power station without making it a condition
541973 we need to roll out ccs on a large scale very very quickly
541974 climate change will have a big impact over the next five decades
541975 our woods will change many species will cope with some warming but there is uncertainty about what happens with extreme events such as droughts and storms which we expect to become more frequent
541976 what is of concern is how the old trees will be replaced younger ones are not doing well whether they reach maturity remains to be seen trees less than 50 years old are showing changes that we would not expect to see until they were about 140
541977 the right way to go is to plant different strains of our native trees perhaps using seeds from france or germany
541978 its better for the countrys image to do things right so we can walk in international forums with our heads high
541979 people refer to energy efficiency as a no brainier but it seems quite bizarre that some very simple steps are not being taken by companies
541980 i believe that significant savings can be made but it seems that many companies just dont know want they should be doing to save energy
541981 for many businesses there is no need to have lights burning all night and to have air conditioning on 24 hours a day
541982 companies are reluctant to spend money if they are not going to get a direct benefit particularly when times are lean
541983 the message that does not seem to be getting through is that within nine months the cost of fitting energy saving measures pays for itself
541984 some companies are doing a lot but in almost every case there are more benefits to be had that are not being done
541985 ships officers recorded air pressure wind strength air and sea temperature and other weather conditions from those records scientists can build a detailed picture of past weather and climate
541986 british archives contain more than 100 000 royal navy logbooks from around 1670 to 1850 alone they are a stunning resource
541987 it means we can deduce numerical values for wind strength and direction temperature and rainfall
541988 global warming is a reality but what our data shows is that climate science is complex and that it is wrong to take particular events and link them to co2 emissions these records will give us a much clearer picture of what is really happening
541989 i was mixing well the same stuff ive been doing
541990 i need to throw strikes with breaking pitches and mix it in a lot of teams look for a lot of offspeed pitches if i can throw those for strikes and then mix in some hard stuff in on their hands once in a while to keep them honest youll usually be successful
541991 its better for the countrys image to do things right so we can walk in international forums with our heads high

541996 the fish and wildlife service determined that the cabinet yaak grizzly population was low enough to warrant reclassification from threatened to endangered in 1993 and reaffirmed its finding in 1999
541997 we are very pleased that the court stopped the helicopter logging in grizzly bear habitat
541998 the forest service keeps logging more and more grizzly bear habitat even though the scientific evidence shows that logging grizzly bear habitat is driving grizzlies in the cabinet yaak grizzly bear recovery zone towards extinction
541999 it is about direct action outside the camp we will break the law or do whatever needs to take place to stop e on peacefully from profiting from climate change last year they made 4 2 billion in profit from creating climate change

542017 these jellyfish near shore are a message the sea is sending us saying look how badly you are treating me
542018 we need to take care of it for our tourism industry but the big problem is not on the beach its whats happening in the seas
542019 human caused stresses including global warming and overfishing are encouraging jellyfish surpluses in many tourist destinations and productive fisheries
542020 in the past few years the dynamic has changed completely the temperature is a little warmer
542021 creating a natural barrier that keeps the jellies from the coast
542022 im a little afraid to go back in the water

542038 the joa in accordance with its own rules and regulations and the iocs rules has withdrawn the entry of the athlete

542040 something they should have already been doing you can tell theyre serious about the whole drug issue i hope people do get caught whether its now or later
542041 suspect athletes will be evaluated from their external appearance by experts they will then undergo four tests including blood tests to examine their sex hormones genes and chromosomes for sex determination
542042 it was at a time when i was trying to take care of myself and trying not to burden my parents so i was buying supplements that i could afford like for 3

542050 i would love to break the record on the worlds biggest stage knowing millions of people are watching and that memories will be made a lot of people still talk about michaels 200 in 96 if i break the world record in beijing i would want them to remember it in the same way
542051 with my talent the way i train and how dedicated i am in that training he johnson knows i can break it
542052 i feel like i am pressing the entire race and that is never going to lead to fast times
542053 over the next couple of weeks adding in a bunch of mile race pace work should make it easier to settle in to the slower races
542054 i mean if i do a bunch of repeats at 56 57 pace and i need to race at 62 pace it should feel easier at least in my head it does
542055 if i dont make the final at the olympics now itll be a bad championships then if i get a good lane in the final who knows
542056 we want to do some of our harder workouts in the same uncomfortable conditions that we will face at the olympics
542057 in the middle of their olympic races i want them thinking wow this is exactly what it felt like in houston and i was able to run 4 30 per mile its that sort of psychological certainty you get by going out and doing it
542058 its not something id put in my body by no means
542059 illegally used olympic trademarks and sold tickets that were never sent to the buyers
542060 i appeal again to the iranian side no longer to play for time but to give us a usable answer to our offers stop dallying
542061 a clear signal for a mutual freeze we would freeze our sanctions efforts and iran the development of its centrifuges this is a clear offer that deserves a clear answer and soon
542062 we would then have to further increase pressure via sanctions

542084 the explosion in the sales of ipods and other portable media devices is more than coincidental
542085 the urban institute a research organization based in washington has released an interesting report that suggests that the proliferation of ipods helps account for the nationwide rise in violent crime in 2005 and 2006
542086 the report suggests that the rise in violent offending and the explosion in the sales of ipods and other portable media devices is more than coincidental and asks rather provocatively is there an icrime wave
542087 the report notes that nationally violent crime fell every year from 1993 to 2004 before rising in 2005 and 2006 just as americas streets filled with millions of people visibly wearing and being distracted by expensive electronic gear
542088 of course as any social scientist will tell you correlation and causation are not the same thing
542089 but they offer three tantalizing observations along with four reasons ipod owners might be particularly susceptible to crime

542091 a quarter of those who bought an iphone switched to operator at amp t which has an exclusive service agreement for the iphone in the united states
542092 while isuppli has not collected historical information on this topic its likely that the speed of the iphones rise to competitive dominance in its segment is unprecedented in the history of the mobile handset market isuppli said

542101 the new screen which eliminates the need for a stylus makes the whole navigation experience so much simpler so much more intuitive he says

542122 i love the itunes music store when apple ceo steve jobs unveiled the shop in the spring of 2003 i called it revolutionary and who can argue that its been anything but
542123 still itunes has always seemed like a stopgap measure something to tolerate until the music industry got its act together
542124 this week amazon launched a beta version of a music store that breaks this lock in
542125 all of amazons tracks are sold as unrestricted mp3s free of digital rights management or drm they will work on just about any music player in the world including an ipod
542126 heres the main way amazon runs circles around itunes i kid you not shopping for digital music at amazon simply feels better than shopping on itunes
542127 as wonderful as it has been to see apple change the music business and make no mistake thats what it did amazons store is only possible because apple paved the way nobody benefits from a digital music monopoly
542128 from now on when i look for music im going to go to amazon first

542149 yeah dont run out just because the signal has changed

542152 because they can burst into flames lithium ion batteries are classified as dangerous goods
542153 before we ship it to the public we have to demonstrate that it is safe
542154 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
542155 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
542156 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
542157 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
542158 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
542159 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
542160 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
542161 hello my name is danny i like sweets there nice
542162 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
542163 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
542164 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
542165 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
542166 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
542167 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
542168 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
542169 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
542170 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
542171 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
542172 what why why are you so mad are you hysterical from the accident that happened just now
542173 so if i didnt stop you back then you and i
542174 are you here to apologize for the tardy this morning
542175 mr fukushima i want you to listen to what we have to say seriously the reason is if any other people heard this they would laugh it off and think that this is a silly story about a dream or fantasy we thought long and hard about whom to tell this story to in the end we decided to consult you mr fukushima
542176 since you trust me fine ill listen to whatever the story you have to tell me without laughing to the end
542177 do you think barack obama should choose hillary clinton as his vice president or not
542178 if barack obama chooses hillary clinton as his vice president would that make you more or less likely to vote for the democratic ticket in november or would that not have an
542179 if a situation arose that required the president to make a decision whether or not to send u s troops into combat who would you trust more to make that decision barack obama or john mccain
542180 if a situation arose that required the president to make a decision whether or not to send u s troops to iran who would you trust more to make that decision barack obama or john mccain
542181 who would you like obama to choose as his vice presidential running mate
542182 have reverend wrights statements affected your opinion of barack obama
542183 in your view what should happen now in the democratic presidential nomination campaign hillary clinton should drop out of the race and concede the nomination to barack obama both hillary clinton and barack obama should continue to campaign or barack obama should drop out of the race and concede the nomination to hillary clinton
542184 as you may know a large number of democratic superdelegates have yet to decide who they will support for the democratic presidential nomination when do you think these uncommitted superdelegates should make their decision after the north carolina and indiana primaries next week right after all the state primaries and caucuses are completed in early june or at the democratic convention in late august
542185 how closely are you following the news about controversial statements made by jeremiah wright former pastor of barack obama
542186 would you rather see those superdelegates base their votes at the convention on the results of the primaries and caucuses held this year or would you rather see the superdelegates base their votes on their view of who would be the best candidate
542187 as you may know florida and michigan currently do not have delegates to the democratic national convention because those states held their primaries in january before the party rules allowed them to do so do you think florida and michigan should or should not hold new primaries or caucuses
542188 at this point either hillary clinton or barack obama is likely to be the democratic party
542189 what if barack obama were to win the democratic party nomination for president
542190 hes a good kid but gets angry so easily well see if you are telling the truth tonight though
542191 kazuko is obviously not right in the head if we dont send her to the doctor shell go crazy for sure
542192 hold on do you have a definite proof that she has an illness or not
542193 but if an earthquake really occurs and there is a fire tonight what are you going to do
542194 youre saying that but you dont know until tonight comes
542195 so i think you should wait until tonight to see what happens if nothing happens as you said you can make a call to wherever as you wish if youre going to call the mental facility tomorrows not too late is it
542196 kazuko you dont look well she did not feel like doing her homework either although it has disappeared from the notebook its a homework that she has already done once before
542197 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
542198 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
542199 it is terrible they are lying like crazy to keep the lambeth conference together they want to make orthodox parishes under siege for wanting to hold fast to the faith the enemy of the diocese and the episcopal church
542200 everywhere i turn they are waiting they come with literature they push into our faces when we step outside our indaba groups they dominate the marketplace and they never leave us alone they wait for us when we go in for meals i do not like this experience
542201 the outright advocacy of unscriptural practices is inviting the church into a new form of slavery a slavery to modern secular culture and to immoral desires and lusts simply because people feel desire to do certain things or to live in certain ways has never before of itself meant that the church should bless them in doing so
542202 the body is dead it must be eliminated before the stink rises
542203 youre not really press youre part of the conspiracy thats trying to divide the episcopal church i can see through you
542204 i know who you are youre spending time around the gafcon people and keith ackerman
542205 culturally many of our bishops come from places where it is culturally accepted to beat your wife in that regard it makes the conversation quite difficult
542206 we had a polite conversation in which i said i was sorry i hadnt told him about what we were doing and why we were doing it
542207 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
542208 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
542209 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
542210 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
542211 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
542212 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
542213 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
542214 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
542215 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
542216 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
542217 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
542218 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
542219 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
542220 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
542221 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
542222 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
542223 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
542224 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
542225 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
542226 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
542227 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
542228 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
542229 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
542230 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
542231 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
542232 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
542233 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
542234 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
542235 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
542236 we havent talked about the gospel we havent talked about salvation
542237 the toothpaste has been squeezed out of the tube and we are not able to put it back again
542238 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
542239 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
542240 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
542241 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
542242 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
542243 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
542244 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
542245 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
542246 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
542247 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
542248 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
542249 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
542250 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
542251 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
542252 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
542253 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
542254 um thats i used to sleep in my sweatpants until yesterday then my mother brought these pajamas out before i went to sleep and told me to sleep in these from tonight on i think she bought these this afternoon
542255 kazuko had the ability to predict the future after all
542256 but if things were like yesterday and today afternoon you wouldnt be convinced just with explanations
542257 i hate this weird things like this happening anyway is it possible for things to go back to way it was
542258 that may be true but i hate the fact that i am the only one with this ability
542259 if people knew of my ability they would treat me like a strange person
542260 we dont know that you have this ability for sure if what you said is true didnt you go back in time just once before then perhaps this just happened accidentally and even if you do have the ability it could just be a one time thing
542261 yeah but i really hate the fact that i might go back in time again
542262 on a global scale i dont think you are going to get this kind of investment again
542263 our marketing campaign for china is the largest we have ever done in a single country
542264 we see this as a marketing platform that will help us to achieve market leadership in china this year
542265 but it is also par for the course part of doing business in this market
542266 our people are really excited to be here it is a win win
542267 we have selected employees who have demonstrated their passion and commitment to coke and the olympics
542268 i hear from clients that they are spending quite a huge amount on that
542269 this is a nice way to do something good with the event even after it is finished
542270 hopefully they are coming in and cracking the whip and making them do the right thing
542271 are we helped or hindered by imperfect technology that is merely good enough
542272 we have lots of alternatives that work most of the time
542273 surveillance directed at a person reasonably believed to be located outside of the united states
542274 our main objective at this point was to ensure that a bill passed that would give us the tools we needed to continue to fight the war on terror
542275 the politics of it were such that that was the concession we were willing to make in order to get this bill passed sooner than later
542276 legislation should not be passed in response to fear mongering
542277 the democrats can rest easily over the august recess knowing that they havent left themselves vulnerable to political attacks the rest of us can worry about whether the nsa is using its enhanced surveillance authority to spy on americans
542278 theres been a ruling over the last four or five months that prohibits the ability of our intelligence services and our counterintelligence people from listening in to two terrorists in other parts of the world where the communication could come through the united states
542279 the problems with this movie can be summed up with one simple acronym cgi as the film goes on it becomes more and more cgi heavy to the point where sequences at the end were clearly filmed as just the actors against a blue screen
542280 the major areas of research in the arctic pertain to climate change and paleoclimate glaciology and geology marine biology and microbiology
542281 there are so many airlines who fly in and out of the country but none of the designated airlines from india is flying there new destinations
542282 biohib is a safe and affordable vaccine that offers complete protection against hib infection
542283 biohib is a conjugate vaccine that has proven its safety and efficacy in multi centric clinical trials
542284 we will source supplies from many of the countries in the nuclear suppliers group including the us russia and france
542285 our unique three stage programme which is predicated on the need to utilise our vast thorium deposits is a logical response to the needs of our economy
542286 the nsg itself has made it clear that they will not do so till the india specific safeguards agreement with the iaea is finalised
542287 this will signal the end of our international isolation of the past few decades india is now too important a country to remain outside the international mainstream in this critical area
542288 this can be doubled with the opening up of international cooperation
542289 iniquitous restrictions and shackles on our programme will enhance our indigenous capabilities
542290 a strong nuclear energy programme is in our vital interest and is important for our scientific development energy needs and security
542291 it will add to our capabilities and strength as a nation
542292 we must take decisive steps to remove the uncertainties that result from shortfall in fuel supplies to avoid disruptions in our nuclear power production
542293 it is a historic occasion and it is a historic statement
542294 there is a nuclear renaissance taking place the world over
542295 the training school has evolved into a model institute which is recognised internationally as a school of excellence it is because of your collective efforts that india is ranked among the top few countries to have mastered the entire nuclear fuel cycle
542296 fully committed to strengthening the autonomy of our nuclear r amp d programme
542297 our unique three stage programme which is predicated on the need to utilise our vast thorium deposits is a logical response to the needs of our economy
542298 i would urge you not to overlook the many other useful applications of nuclear technology our nation needs this technology in the areas of agriculture food preservation health care and industry
542299 when the world is willing to invest in india in our future we must also learn to invest in the world and benefit from this two way flow of ideas of goods and services of people and possibilities
542300 i have earlier expressed concern at the declining enrolment in basic sciences in our colleges and universities we are working to revitalise existing scientific institutions and creating modern new institutes of excellence but at the end of the day the intellectual imagination of our youth will be fired by great names and great achievements we need new role models in our scientific community
542301 i wish to make one appeal be bold be brave be innovative be curious and be open to new ideas new ways of thinking and new ways of doing things this is the scientific method
542302 this car will be a virtual vehicle which is a demonstration of indias technical capabilities the project was inaugurated today and we hope to create the digital car in about two years
542303 in fact satyam is now operating in sectors which were even unheard of in 19th century an era of discovery but are now some of the major revenue grossers for the company
542304 institutions are good in research but not in development and therefore there is a need for this interface
542305 this type of research is very important for india especially for the long term interests of the industry concerned
542306 the focus will be on better fuel economy and lower co2 emission
542307 this immortal strand idea has been floating around for a long time without being tested in stem cells that could be definitively identified this paper demonstrates that it is not a general property of all stem cells
542308 weve been able to show that this is not a mechanism by which blood forming stem cells reduce their risk of turning into cancer and presumably we should be looking elsewhere to understand what those mechanisms really are
542309 what we found is that not many stem cells retained it
542310 in fact what happened with the label was completely consistent with what youd expect by random chromosome segregation which is known to be how most cells divide and was completely inconsistent in every context we looked with the immortal strand model
542311 then will appear in heaven the sign of the son of man
542312 deal with that later right now the customer is always right
542313 i dont like violence and i dont like to see people suffer
542314 i dont like violence and i dont like to see people suffer
542315 i believe we can be good people and kind to others
542316 thats the way it is this is who i am and thats just the way i do things theres nothing i can do about it
542317 this is who i am its just a family trait
542318 wood is wood a rock is a rock and its wise to value them for what they are and to know the difference especially if you are making a fire
542319 educated culture conditioned or taught company values so they stop it
542320 this is my molecule i created it i own it its mine and i am going to fight for it
542321 i thought it would just come and fall into my lap i never sat down and did a plan
542322 there also wasnt anything as low as 1998s two gentlemen of verona
542323 i had a long break this summer but ive played every pre season game and i feel ready
542324 my main aim for the season is to do well for everton silverware it would be nice
542325 we got to the semi final of the league cup and obviously we went far in europe this time well be looking to go one step further in each of the competitions
542326 everyone knows the squads not as big as wed like
542327 but at the minute were gelling more so than we probably would if we had a bigger squad because most players have to play every game
542328 we can take the positives out of that and hopefully we can get a few additions that will help strengthen us
542329 we hadnt seen them before but we underachieved well be looking to put that right tomorrow
542330 ive looked at a number of other specimens sat in a few other wagner auctions but this is the one that makes collecting worth while
542331 since i was 8 years old ive hoped and dreamed that one day id be able to get one
542332 the mystique and allure of the t206 wagner card continues to grow
542333 on saturday aug 4 well publish a special report in the print edition that explores the issue and attempts to answer the toughest questions regarding illegal immigration

542346 i started quite early because i knew there would be a lot of pressure for the second album and i didnt want to write songs under anyones stopwatch it hasnt been too bad
542347 plug your keyboard in plug it in set it all up and get headphones
542348 hes taking his playbook home things are starting to make a little bit more sense to him i think thats the giant step hes taking forward
542349 im just trying to enjoy it while im playing because when im 50 years old and people dont know me ill be like i kind of miss that
542350 i was at a movie and he came on doing a commercial with an astronaut suit
542351 its crazy to see him on there because he is your teammate
542352 the guy is special you have to come up with a better adjective than special ive got to look in my thesaurus or dictionary to find one he just has it
542353 theres nothing else to say thats an amazing cat i just be watching him smiling
542354 people want to make that the main focus and thats not the main focus at all
542355 i have my individual goals but my main goal is to win the division and get to the super bowl if along the way i get that it happens its going to remain 2 000 every year but its not my main focus
542356 hes a guy that sets outrageous goals and meets them and thats fine with me because hes shown he can handle that
542357 and he knows hes not going to sneak up on anybody
542358 there were some things i looked at on film last season and was like man that was crazy
542359 but there were definitely a lot of things i looked at and felt i could do a whole lot better
542360 in the last few days he had about 20 squalls
542361 he hardly got any sleep what with taking sails down and putting them back up again
542362 wow i cant believe hes so young and he sailed here all on his own
542363 can i have a photo of you and i together
542364 i have to sail through torres strait which is pretty much the deadliest strait in the world
542365 around there they have 20 foot tides meaning a lot of strong current oil rigs to avoid and lots of shipping
542366 round the cape of good hope by november or december
542367 these boats are worth about 25 000 but this guy was selling his for 12 000
542368 i then spent about four months getting her in shape
542369 i use this to talk to my mom marianne at least once or twice a day in the morning i give her my position and tell her what sort of weather im having then later in the day i usually have a chat with her about whatevers going on

542380 es la provincia que m s va a crecer con el turismo en los pr ximos cinco a os
542381 hace cinco meses visit este lugar para iniciar las tareas de perforaci n y hoy podemos comprobar que aquel sue o se hizo realidad
542382 enriquece la oferta tur stica de concordia y de la costa del uruguay
542383 esto es lo que tenemos que hacer desde el estado
542384 en turismo entre r os es la provincia que m s va a crecer en los pr ximos cinco a os por lo tanto este tipo de iniciativas son las que el estado debe promover
542385 esta obra es el puntapi inicial de todo un desarrollo tur stico del perilago

542388 la dirigencia rural confunde el cumplimiento de reglas con trabas control con pol ticas arbitrarias
542389 un sector hist ricamente privilegiado como el que representa luciano miguens deber a hacer un esfuerzo para tener m s apego a las reglas minimizar su fervorosa construcci n de pol ticas de concentraci n econ mica y embarcarse en competir en un mercado algo m s transparente
542390 en esto somos categ ricos deben saber los ruralistas de palermo que mientras m s produzcan y m s declaren m s exportar n quiero destacar un ejemplo del sector de granos hay 900 mil toneladas de trigo pan recientemente autorizadas para su exportaci n n mero surgido de la producci n declarada ante la oncca si quieren leer esto como una se al de la oncca al mercado la se al la puedo explicar en cuatro palabras deben transparentar su producci n
542391 necesitamos un mercado de granos transparente l stima que los ruralistas de palermo no tienen en cuenta qu algunos de sus socios exportaron en 2007 el 90 de su producci n a para sos fiscales como m naco islas v rgenes e islas caim n sin embargo el estado cumple con su deber la aduana estableci que el 86 del aceite de soja a granel tambi n fue facturado a para sos fiscales y el 80 de las exportaciones de harina de soja tuvieron estos mismos destinos

542398 queremos que los gobernantes sepan que el campo forma parte del pa s y nunca ser furg n de cola de las decisiones
542399 el campo contribuy a que se devolvieran protagonismo a las instituciones
542400 el campo est unido y esta realidad est aqu para quedarse
542401 hemos superado con unidad a quienes buscaban nuestra divisi n unidos hemos comenzado esta lucha y pese a quien le pese unidos la terminaremos

542406 unidos comenzamos esta lucha y pese a quien pese unidos la terminaremos
542407 las facultades que el gobierno le ha otorgado al presidente de la oncca son excesivas y se est n utilizando en forma abusiva y discrecional
542408 la dirigencia rural confunde el cumplimiento de reglas con trabas y al control con pol ticas arbitrarias
542409 defendiendo la informalidad en el campo y los mecanismos de elusi n fiscal
542410 la eliminaci n de las retenciones a todos los productos de las econom as regionales
542411 el pa s se va a levantar con el campo nunca sin el campo y menos contra el campo
542412 la argentina produce 15 millones de toneladas de trigo de las que exporta 5 millones
542413 se autoriz la exportaci n de apenas un tercio de los cupos acordados oportunamente con el gobierno nacional
542414 estamos en el peor de los mundos continu cristina no hace m s que ratificar lo peor de su gobierno la manipulaci n de las cifras del indec a guillermo moreno y al tren bala pero a la vez niega la inflaci n la crisis energ tica y los problemas fiscales tampoco se hace cargo de la inseguridad y elude la responsabilidad que le cabe al gobierno por la falta de pol ticas preventivas del delito entre otras
542415 despu s de m s de 4 meses de una absurda crisis provocada por la tozudez del gobierno y frente las respuestas negadoras de la presidente la nica salida es m s congreso libre y mayor justicia independiente
542416 los legisladores de cualquier partido y los jueces de cualquier instancia no deben tener miedo en su labor porque ante un gobierno que mantiene su sesgo autoritario que queda mas claro incluso en las palabras de esta tarde la mayor institucionalidad se alcanzar con poderes realmente independientes y respeto real a la constituci n nacional
542417 la soberbia la impugnaci n del otro y las decisiones caprichosas solo nos mantendr n como pa s al margen de las posibilidades que el mundo nos ofrece hoy mas congreso y mayor justicia es la f rmula para enderezar el rumbo

542434 they say i played the game with heart and determination it has been written i played the game with a lot of poise a countless number of fans have told me i played with a high level of integrity
542435 maybe all those compliments are true i an assure you every time i stepped onto the field at municipal stadium and arrowhead stadium i did with the knowledge i was representing the kansas city chiefs i knew what it meant to millions and millions americans across the world i did play the game with passion and with respect and a lot of heart
542436 the chiefs in the 60s and 70s played the game the right way

542448 hes still playing great it happens in every sport when someone sets the bar so high guys find a way of creeping up behind you
542449 i dont think theres a huge difference between a semifinal and a final but to win it would be huge
542450 im going to have to play against one of the best players in the world to win it i feel like im playing well enough to do it
542451 hes still playing great it happens in every sport when someone sets the bar so high guys find a way of creeping up behind you
542452 i dont think theres a huge difference between a semifinal and a final but to win it would be huge
542453 im going to have to play against one of the best players in the world to win it i feel like im playing well enough to do it
542454 ive been making sure i get ice on it after every match it hurts sometimes after matches
542455 cest lestimation la plus fiable que nous ayions eu depuis le d but de l pid mie
542456 it could be a write off the insurance adjusters will have to determine that theres extensive water and fire damage to both houses
542457 well we understand that its our issue to fix and we were unexpected by the results that we saw on sunday we didnt predict that so now what we are doing is we are analyzing all of our manufacturing operation to make sure that the right side tire that we raced there was actually what we thought it was weve been through that analysis and were satisfied that we are ok in that respect so now what we are looking at is that whole mechanism of tire wear that ah were trying to model the new car on that race track with that tire combination to be able to predict that wear so that we can come up with a solution for 2009
542458 well its the attitude of the car when it enters the corner its changing the way the tire abrades so what weve got is weve got again were trying to model that exact interface between the tire and the race track but then what we are going to do is modify the materials that we have in that rubber weve talked to a lot of our research chemists to get some ideas from them and what were going to try to do is formulate a compound differently so that in that kind of an abrasion mode we put a tread compound on that tire that will actually rubber in the racetrack
542459 yea we were absolutely shocked again we ran the same right side compound in 06 and 07 and we tested it in 08 on the car of tomorrow it appeared that that right side compound was going to be the best race tire compound that we had available we saw nothing in that test that would indicate a problem we did see high wear in that test like we normally do but we again thought the track would rubber in and be fine with the race and thats what never happened we did see some improvement on the right front and honestly that was a fairly normal wear throughout the race on sunday in other words the right front looked to us in 08 almost like it did in 07 and 06 but the right rear wear was just horrendous
542460 we actually had some discussions with nascar about a larger tire several years ago we initiated those discussions again with nascar in the spring of 08 so we are actually doing a lot of work on that we have a lot of people doing some modeling on what exactly this tire size should look like what tire size does this car really want so we are looking at larger bead diameters we are looking at larger section width were looking at a larger diameters we are trying to figure out the right contained air volume to carry the load that these cars deliver and also what we think might provide the best handling
542461 boy that is really a complicated situation see on a really high abrasive race track you are faced with the rubber going somewhere lets take indianapolis one of the most abrasive surfaces that we run at no matter what you put on there from a tire standpoint it is going to wear those tires out and it is going to rubber in the race track so what youre faced with is in order to try to get around it you know thats going to happen so if you go there with a simple solution oh gee lets just put more tire rubber on there put more gauge in the tread well then you end up with like dover in 1994 what happens is you have a tire and everything looks fine and the track gets rubbered in and then you come to race day and the track is rubbered in and the wear goes away and the tire contains the heat and you blister everything so you cant get yourself in that situation so you have to have a tire that deals with the abrasion but also isnt going to cause you problems on race day when you know that the track surface is going to change so you have to be able to deal with that on sunday
542462 because what we had was we had this known quantity a proven race tire that had worked for us in 06 and 07 we know the car of tomorrow and what it does and doesnt do so we were comfortable with that aspect of it the tire test that we had on the car of tomorrow at that race track with kurt busch brian vickers and dale earnhardt junior was a good test and we saw nothing out of the ordinary there so there was no signal that would indicate to us that we needed to do something like that
542463 i think that these guys are professional drivers and when we go to a tire test they know whats on the line they know that they are there to help us develop a tire that were going to go back and race i think we get 100 percent from these guys now the difference is you test and you drive a certain way the change then is when they race you race a different way dont you the car moves around a lot more on a race track as you are passing and obviously you are not trying to deal with practice in a tire test sometimes the way you muscle the car around a little bit more during a race as you are moving through traffic does affect the tire wear or tire heat sometimes we have seen that honestly i feel pretty good about the job that these professional drivers deliver for us during a tire test
542464 i am confident we will find an answer what that is i dont know at the moment weve got a lot of theories on what we need to do to fix that but i think we are going the right direction we have got a lot of people working a lot of hours back in akron ohio right now trying to analyze this problem and determine a set of solutions were going to go back weve got two dates at indianapolis already this fall were going to go back twice and see if we can make some progress towards a solution because we do need to prove to ourselves that we do have the capability of making a tire that will last a fuel stop on the car of tomorrow at indianapolis
542465 i will make your battlements of rubies your gates of sparkling jewels and all your walls of precious stones all your sons will be taught by the lord and great will be your childrens peace
542466 its a bittersweet moment i so want some kind of resolution for my aunt

542468 alice hummel disappeared never to be heard from again after agreeing to confront her husband bruce hummel about his molestation of their 13 year old daughter
542469 the evidence clearly shows that bruce hummel had the motive and opportunity to murder alice hummel and in fact did so in october 1990
542470 i rowed and bailed for an hour and a half at least but the wind got worse and i had to let her body go
542471 i was too tired to cry but i remember saying a silent prayer
542472 it was sort of an unspoken thing our family didnt talk about it at all
542473 but the circumstances of what we heard that she left without saying goodbye to her own children we knew she would never have done that a mother would never go off without saying goodbye to her own children

542475 in andrew bostoms excellent column today he gives us a glimpse of the classical muslim attitude toward religious dialogue ibn khaldun is considered perhaps the greatest mind the islamic world ever produced here is his opinion of christians we do not think that we should blacken the pages of this book the muqaddimah with discussion of their christian dogmas of unbelief in general they are well known all of them are unbelief this is clearly stated in the noble koran to discuss or argue those things with them is not up to us it is for them to choose between conversion to islam payment of the poll tax or death conversion subjugation or death three choices
542476 penalizing pollution instead of penalizing employment will work to reduce that pollution
542477 instead of discouraging businesses from hiring more employees it would discourage business from producing more pollution

542483 good for science because it forces people to make their case and advances understanding
542484 but its prudent to take actions that both minimize human effect on the climate and also make ourselves much more resilient
542485 a great act of faith and i dont believe any of it
542486 why do it if its not going to make a difference anyway
542487 whether im right or wrong we cant do anything about it anyway
542488 there are uncertainties its not like you change your light bulbs today youre going to have better weather tomorrow
542489 its even better if those actions youre taking make sense for other reasons like getting off middle eastern oil or saving money
542490 if georgia continues provocative actions we will announce the recruitment of volunteers not only in the north ossetia but in the entire north caucasus and also carry out general mobilization in south ossetia
542491 its most serious concern about the escalation of tensions in south ossetia
542492 i must mention o donnell because while she claims herself a woman of the left she is the polar opposite of fallaci and i cannot let fallaci go without focusing for a second on how far the left as devolved where resistance member fallaci was intelligently confrontational trendy cause committed o donnell is merely shrill where fallaci dared to look at the effects of christianity and islam on civilizations and see real differences and moral distinctions odonnell casts a vapid bigoted glance and calls them all cake declaring radical christianity is just as threatening as radical islam after all she doesnt have to think the thinking has been done for her by her co ideologues all she has to do is fall in line and parrot i gag i barely want to waste the energy to respond to it because shes really not worth it so ill simply leave it to ms odonnell to point out to the rest of us the buildings that have been flown into the throats that have been slit the genitals which have been mutiliated the raped women who have been killed for their victimhood the countless suicide bombers who have died screaming jesus is lord as they blew themselves up the gays who have been hanged for being gay the raging catholics who rampaged through the streets burning andres serrano in effegy when he submerged a crucifix in urine and called it art the christian who have murdered filmmakers for making less than flattering films about their faith come on rosie make your case and justify that moral equivalence you so easily lazily thoughtlessly burp out to the assured applause of your upper west side audience dont point to a few sick extremists who have killed abortionists unless you are willing to admit that the christians themselves have condemned such violence show us the justification for your statement that radical christianity is just as threatening as radical islam the truth is ms o donnell radical anything is unappetizing whether that be radical judges creating laws out of whole cloth just because they want to or radical gays storming st patricks cathedral and notre dame cathedral hmmmm musta missed it when the radical christians stormed the lilith festivals can you admit that do you have that much intellectual honesty when you are done justifying that incredibly prejudiced stupid and unfounded statement ms o donnell you might then to compound the moral strength of your own superior ideology point out the hospitals and soup kitchens and crisis centers you and your leftist pals have built around the world and you can reassure us that they treat anyone in need even if they dont belong to your club im sure they can be found in every city you can display the free clinics and kitchens and schools and job training centers you and your friends have built in haiti and in africa and in appalachia you can show us the homes built to help single mothers who choose to keep their babies because youre pro choice right and which teach them to become independent please make your case ms o donnell well wait
542493 people use words to criticize islam muslims use stones fire and eventually bombs to protest back when was the last time christians threw firebombs at a mosque to protest muslim imams characterizing christianity as polytheistic when have we seen jews firebomb mosques for muslim leaders calling them the descendants of pigs and monkeys a common insult from both religious and secular muslims in the middle east muslims have proven benedict prophetic and dont think for a moment that this wave of violence has peaked
542494 benedict has managed in his very scholarly fashion to apply a very hot drawing poultice to the enormous and festering boils of both radical islamism and rampant secularism
542495 anyone who describes islam as a religion as intolerant encourages violence
542496 we have to guard against infodemics in which inaccurate false information is disseminated prompting social unrest that spreads like an epidemic
542497 the reality is that we lack the means to effectively deal with harmful internet messages
542498 the regulations violate the autonomy of the internet and are an effective tool for tighter media control by the government
542499 the regulations would bring about a reverse in the advancement of the internet media as a whole
542500 but the internet media should also serve public good and compared with other countries south korea has lacked the institutional control over the media in which people tend to expand and reproduce unverified one sided information

542509 to all those interested in forcefeeding economic intelligence to the public i suggest the following every time you purchase something follow this procedure 1 walk to cash register 2 take out wallet 3 pull out money 4 turn around and face crowd holding money in upraised fist 5 announce authoritatively to onlookers you see this money this is money that i would have spent on my window if it were broken but it wasnt broken and so im buying some stuff with it 6 smile pay and exit such a procedure could become a trademark amongst the economically wise a virtual handshake between peers a badge of honor and a great way to meet hot sexy free market members of the opposite sex
542510 todd handy and his colleagues have written the definitive book on erp methodology they cover all of the important technical details that one would want to see in such a handbook such as digital filtering and artifact removal but just as important they also provide a sophisticated and comprehensive guide to designing analyzing and interpreting erp experiments something the field has needed for years also noteworthy is the inclusion of a number of cutting edge topics such as wavelet analysis and the combination of functional neuroimaging with erps any cognitive neuroscientist wanting to do quality erp research would do well to read this book
542511 this is a marvelous book packed with essential information on the design analysis and interpretation of experiments with event related potentials it provides comprehensive and lucid coverage of the latest experimental techniques and exposes the many common pitfalls to avoid handys book should be required reading for novice researchers in this field and it will expand the horizons of veteran investigators of human brain function

542513 one of the oldest types of energy used by people is muscular energy so this is nothing new
542514 i disconnected the resistor and started storing the energy into a battery that is then used as power it was a way to show there can be very simple solutions it doesnt always have to be high tech
542515 this is just the first version we are willing to take it further
542516 we receive a lot of requests from other companies for people who want to use the floors we get many of these for bus and train stations places where there are lots of people
542517 i think its a science field which will be one of the future
542518 with so many kids not exercising enough a battery could be created for these devices so they had to create the energy to use them the same could be done for television sets
542519 we could get the situation where people have to cycle so they can use it
542520 its a very good marketing tool for businesses but it terms of economics it does not make sense at all
542521 the project dance floor in itself doesnt save a lot of energy its more of a statement than anything
542522 im immensely pleased with our performance at loeries this year six golds between the two companies is outstanding considering how hard it is to get one of those coveted birds these days

542587 why should the german be interested in the liberation of the jew if the jew is not interested in the liberation of the german we recognize in judaism therefore a general anti social element of the present time in the final analysis the emancipation of the jews is the emancipation of mankind from judaism indeed in north america the practical domination of judaism over the christian world has achieved as its unambiguous and normal expression that the preaching of the gospel itself and the christian ministry have become articles of trade money is the jealous god of israel in face of which no other god may exist

542697 investigators determined that clark rockefeller and reigh were staying in an apartment in close proximity to a facility known as the anchorage marina where clark was docking his 26ft unnamed catamaran
542698 investigators used this information to create a ruse to lure clark from to apartment to the marina by placing a call to him and telling him his boat was taking on water
542699 when clark left the apartment he was immediately placed under arrest by fbi agents reigh was located alone in the apartment

542714 this is probably the first major recession brought about by speculation and wall street
542715 i dont think enough has been made of that this is not your ordinary recession where consumer demand goes down and production goes down this is massive trauma a speculative earthquake that is ricocheting throughout our economy from the crooks and gamblers on wall street

542721 our findings raise the possibility that the physical symptoms of depression are particularly toxic to the cardiovascular system
542722 identifying the most harmful aspect of depression is important because we will then know which specific components to target with our treatments
542723 our study is important because it is the first to simultaneously examine the links between all of these negative emotions and sub clinical atherosclerosis
542724 in addition we broke depression down into physical and cognitive emotion symptom clusters which is uncommon
542725 no secondary prevention trial has successfully reduced cardiovascular risk by targeting depression
542726 there currently exists no evidence that treating depression will help prevent heart disease
542727 the biggest reason is that studies that would be needed to draw that conclusion would have to be large and therefore very expensive
542728 hopefully an added bonus will be to reduce the risk of developing or suffering from heart disease
542729 ultimately we plan to use the data from this study and similar investigations to develop a psychological treatment for adults at risk for cardiovascular disease
542730 we hope that our treatment when combined with standard treatments will help to prevent the development of cardiovascular disease
542731 i looked up and coach kill was actually in the pile
542732 we looked at it on film and he was running behind me the whole time right into the pile hes pulling guys off me yelling stuff it was crazy but thats coach kill
542733 you have to respect a guy who follows you into the hole
542734 anybody tough enough to see me after that is somebody i want to play for
542735 i was the healthiest one of the bunch and there were a lot of people who had it a lot worse than i did
542736 i was sort of humbled i thought i dont have it bad i began to think about having money job insurance being taken care of but those people were fighting with little money
542737 to be honest with you the best thing that ever happened to me is the cancer
542738 ive been able to help people and learned that i have got a wonderful life i have a great wife two children everything i could ever want and there are people out there who dont have anything no insurance no job because of having to take time away
542739 all those people who tell you their priorities are god family
542740 i admit it i am a good family man but i put everything i had into the programs i was part of and sometimes the other things slip now i dont miss church and i make sure i talk to my wife every night it gives you a taste of reality
542741 there were times something would be going on and if i had to stay at the office one more hour to get this play right or look at this film id be late to my daughters softball game or whatever i missed out on a lot of things now i wont do that and i wont let people on my staff do it if i can help it ill tell you this much im not missing out on nothin
542742 we were always close in our family but after the cancer he might come home a little earlier to do things with our two daughters and make time for things in his life
542743 well always have a picture of coach joe in this office i can tell you that
542744 we were 1 10 my first year at southern illinois and we were talking
542745 putting kids into scheduled activities takes children out of the free floating of pretend play
542746 during unstructured play kids are learning how to problem solve a big part of that is creative thinking
542747 some of the consequences of over scheduling are stress burnout anxiety and depression
542748 parenting is kind of like flying a kite you have to know when to rein it in and when to let it out
542749 a parent needs to know their childs temperament and individual interests
542750 for instance if you have a really shy child and you put them into a large group that is kind of rambunctious the anxiety is going to be really high
542751 i do believe in extracurricular activities but i also believe in strong parenting
542752 sometimes just leaving children to themselves not giving them the solution is the first step
542753 this skill will make them more successful in life its about being able to master your environment not just mastering the skills
542754 it was emotionally tough to rehearse this play because it touched me quite personally
542755 i had to distil it from my own experience it really affected me
542756 magdalena is quite fragile and at the same time she can be externally strong
542757 it was very important for me not to take a bow at the end
542758 it was difficult because i had to immerse myself in the subject for a long period of time
542759 i was searching for this state of mind and searching in myself for other memories and recollections i didnt get depressed but i shut down and stopped communicating eventually i found ways to protect myself which are invisible to the audience so that i am not hurt by the performance i have done the part so many times it is as if i use a certain software to do it i use some memories and associations and it just happens i am exhausted at the end but after the many performances i have done i can handle it
542760 i think of that as a sign also by chance we opened the show on sarah kanes birthday i think she directs things from above
542761 i think im going to bump into some lovely old ghosts while im here and i cant wait
542762 ive been here twice before way back in the 1950s
542763 some friends and i came up from london and im afraid i cant remember where we were based or what we performed a revue i think yes i was a dancer others sang or told jokes but there was one night when everyone else went down with flu and i pretty much had to do the whole show myself i was very young full of dreams so it didnt faze me at all
542764 my first marriage to dundee hotelier bill keith ended badly he was a compulsive gambler and even when i was heavily pregnant hed refuse to stop playing these joints and take me home he obviously had no money and it was very tough for me on my own but im an aries and ive always believed that that dire situation was the making of me and the rep where i played joan of arc and antigone was certainly the making of me as an actress i loved it there really loved it
542765 once when i was appearing in the west end a letter arrived at the stage door the writing had been smudged with some suspicious looking fluid but i could still make out the odd lewd suggestion and on the back of the envelope it said if not known please send to susan penhaligon c o another theatre
542766 c a t s eyes got a bit silly charlies angels in kent and i was given a new love interest every week but the gentle touch had been the first telly drama to base itself round a female copper helen mirren and prime suspect came after me
542767 it didnt bother me that fred became more famous anyway the good roles dry up for a woman it always happens in the end
542768 fred desperately wants a pool like everyone else in hollywood but theres no way hes digging up my lovely garden for it
542769 and im always telling him he has to behave himself because hes no longer my toyboy and i could trade him in for two
542770 whats our secret its the old one about making each other laugh and the fact that were not always together fred is in marrakech right now filming the prince of persia is good if we were wed have probably killed each other by now
542771 i hate how america has ruined the english language math erb methodology disoriented im disorien tated by what theyve done to it
542772 i miss it for all the usual things like the irony although not the tendency to criticise too much but fred is so busy out there and i love the climate friends like millicent martin our dogs and my roses and although i might moan about them sometimes i really do admire americans for their lack of reserve and the way they embrace you with great love
542773 no one thought id want to come to edinburgh with it but here i am back where it all began for me goodness knows where that old hall was but id love to find it
542774 he was going to go out in a blaze of glory and he was going to take everybody out there with him
542775 he just looked worried depressed anxious way turned into himself
542776 it would be overstating it to say he looked like a guy who was being led to his execution but its not far off
542777 we thought he worked out really well he was a critical part of our vaccine studies
542778 he always was upbeat with a big smile it was colonel franz let me tell you what im doing i think of him as a geek his pants too short and his pocket protector showing he had a kind of 1960s look
542779 awards are nice but the real satisfaction is knowing the vaccine is back on line
542780 has a history dating to his graduate days of homicidal threats actions plans threats amp actions toward therapists
542781 i will miss you dad i love you and i cant wait to see you in heaven
542782 popularity has strongly declined from its record heights after the september 11 2001 attacks to a point where he is now slightly more popular than polio
542783 youll get tons of hate mail bitching about why there arent tons of pictures of naked women
542784 i do not care if suddenly a million people email me or something and tell me im a loser or im put on a government watch list because the word needs to be spread and im sure youve heard of it already peaches
542785 well it kinda pissed me off so i took my frineds minute maid lemonade can and started shaking it up real good right behind my friend who kept going
542786 where you apparently are split into different rock bands or something like that
542787 theyre going to try to make you afraid of me hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black
542788 so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
542789 mere anarchy is loosed upon the world the blood dimmed tide is loosed and everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned the best lack all conviction while the worst are full of passionate intensity
542790 the present situation results from the fact that the protection of society has received more emphasis than the rehabilitation of inmates consequently we have decided from now on to stress the rehabilitation of offenders rather than the protection of society
542791 theyd say you need to get to 275 pounds by the time you get back
542792 weve got to have guys that are in the single digits in body fat i just think the more sleek you are the better youre going to move
542793 im a small guy and ive got to stay lean ive got to use my leverage and my quickness to my advantage rather than trying to be big and out fat everybody
542794 but wed rather give up a little size for movement
542795 last year we had maybe 10 15 guys fail the preseason run test just because they wanted to bulk up and just be huge rather than lean and quick and conditioned
542796 i think everyone but one person finished the run test earlier this week thats a good example of how the programs changed were more football players rather than power lifters now
542797 the eating habits its definitely pounded into our heads more to eat healthy
542798 ive found out over the years those lean guys they dont get hurt as much

542807 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while
542808 this puts a key part of the dashboard in place
542809 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic
542810 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history
542811 evidence of a failure by government and society to do what it takes to control the epidemic
542812 we have been inadequately funding this epidemic all along we need to step it up
542813 the u s government never discusses the specific security clearance of an individual employee or military member
542814 time honored procedures to examine security clearances on a regular basis
542815 very important that the fbi present their case against bruce and not just state that the investigation was over because it was him and hes gone
542816 im concerned about what closing this case without conclusive evidence might do to harm our life sciences enterprise i think we as americans need to see the proof
542817 its a shame the man is not here with us we might have known more
542818 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure

542824 i walked with her for a bit and from her perspective maybe it was unwanted attention but she didnt make that clear
542825 it didnt seem like she was telling me to go away if shed told me to leave id have done so straight away

542829 i just think its important for people to know we believe this is the right direction for the packers to go both now and in the future
542830 no disrespect to brett but with brett the attention is kind of always on brett
542831 without brett its more on the team if he isnt with us that gives us a better opportunity to kind of let people know that were not a fluke we arent built on just one person

542841 were hopefully intelligent human beings who can talk about discuss and maybe even achieve much greater things than learning about who youre shagging
542842 so for me ive always stepped away from that and now that im in the public eye a bit more ive just tried to ignore it
542843 its not important and weve got many more important things to deal with im not a celebrity im a musician

542853 when i was very young most of my childhood heroes wore capes flew through the air or picked up buildings with one arm they were spectacular and got a lot of attention but as i grew my heroes changed so that now i can honestly say that anyone who does anything to help a child is a hero to me
542854 ill love you forever ill like you for always as long as im living my baby youll be
542855 beginnings are scary endings are usually sad but its the middle that counts the most try to remember that when you find yourself at a new beginning
542856 be kind for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle
542857 ive organized so many dates and it really makes me feel good about it ive not had one complaint
542858 its really fun driving a taxi in new york is not an easy job so i just try to create some fun

542861 garazi omg ummmmm i guess in front of the whole twitter verse ill say id be happy to spend the rest of my geek life with you
542862 shame on the woman who plagiarized my narrative and stole it for her profile
542863 to the girl who copied my profile and denies it you s
542864 i get a lot of women emailing me which is great for an ego boost
542865 you know that woman who is the first person on the dance floor at every party thats me
542866 everybody steals the same lines so they are not original anymore
542867 i have a sweet tooth love my strawberry twizzlers and cheesecake jelly beans
542868 in france in the fashion business when you see something that looks good you take it and you copy it
542869 i felt he was less than honest a manipulator and downright stupid
542870 when youre dealing with these high level in your face go for everything guys youre dealing with people who take a lot of risks if that results in gains for them they get on a roll and pretty soon their risk management starts to fade a little
542871 at some point they cant manage every aspect of their lives they have to blow off some steam so they say to themselves this is something im going to do for thrills or chills or fun its kind of dangerous and im not going to worry about it for politicians thats often in their private life where they dont have people managing them all the time and thats where things get out of hand
542872 look at spitzer hes mr rectitude the terror of wall street and he busts prostitution rings and yet he allegedly goes into that very lions den the prostitution ring and partakes if that isnt risk taking i dont know what other label to put on it
542873 these people have a strong need to win at games which is obviously important in power politics
542874 we sometimes say god what do these people think the rules dont apply to them well thats often true they really do live in a different world from most of us
542875 spitzer apparently had access to a service where you pay top dollar for exclusivity and discretion one that most people dont have access to probably your average philanderer doesnt know such a company even exists
542876 i did something for the worst possible reason just because i could
542877 for the first time it is possible to determine by a simple rapid and inexpensive method if a woman has got a g spot or not
542878 if a woman spends all her time worrying about whether she is normal or has a g spot or not she will focus on just one area and ignore everything else its telling people that there is a single best way to have sex which isnt the right thing to do
542879 i like making a big deal out of a lot of things so yes i like to have a whole day of romance i like surprises and i like sending valentines cards i went to an all girls high school and every valentines day they would announce who had flowers waiting in the office i got very used to the importance of giving other women valentines because my name was never called never and i didnt have any money to send them to myself
542880 i find younger guys will usually be totally into you while older guys will be looking over your shoulder at a younger woman
542881 younger men expect an older woman to be more accomplished they are looking for you because you are intelligent they are not looking for a mother
542882 natural selection speed date ii sugar mamas amp boy toys
542883 i think for men it is an incredible fantasy to be with an older woman
542884 older women are more experienced and they know what they want
542885 its so important for women to be informed and empowered in all areas of their lives
542886 and im thrilled to be able to start 2008 by launching this fund to help women to do just that ddhg empowers in partnership with the dade community foundation will fund projects and programs that uplift women give them a voice and make a positive impact on their lives
542887 dontdatehimgirl com gives us a powerful tool that can help to limit the amount of damage con men and sociopaths can wreak on our lives

542890 americans want to have trust in their relationships but sometimes theyd rather have that trust broken
542891 we want honesty in our relationships but only if it doesnt offend or contradict our own self image we want to know that when it comes to the big things like infidelity finances or relationship problems our partners are being honest and truthful but where physical appearance annoying habits and personal preferences are concerned we accept and often expect to be lied to
542892 los primeros d as est n siendo bastante intensos en pretemporada hay que entrenarse fuerte para comenzar bien la liga porque luego eso se agradecer cuando empiece la competici n

542894 todos tenemos ganas e ilusi n de poder jugar en pretemporada todos salimos de cero y el m ster es el que tiene que decidir pero se lo estamos poniendo todo el grupo bastante dif cil
542895 espero mantener mi nivel de los dos ltimos a os
542896 es una primera etapa progresiva que el equipo lleva bastante bien
542897 afronto este curso con mucha ilusi n espero una buena temporada tanto en el plano colectivo donde debemos lograr el objetivo de la permanencia como en el individual ya que espero mantener el nivel que he mostrado en el equipo estos dos ltimos a os
542898 con el cambio de categor a se necesitaban jugadores de una calidad y experiencia como los que han venido por ahora se est n adaptando bien hab a un grupo muy unido y los nuevos se han enganchado r pido

542904 are you fucking stupid why would i ever want to fuck any of my fans have you ever seen my fans they are fucking gross and fat why do you think they have to jerk off to me the day i fuck my fans is the day i become a whore

542910 when you get good athletes like williams theyre going to be good in just about any sport you shove them into and i think he could be good enough in rugby union to one day become an all black
542911 if he puts the work in and stays humble and things went his way with injury and that theres no doubt he could go as far as he wants
542912 if sonny bill plays the game hell probably be playing at 13 or on the wing just to try and get a feel of the game
542913 and to have a bloke like tana who is probably the best in that position in the last two decades you couldnt have a better bloke to try and get you on your feet and running in rugby union
542914 any team that gets him would be rubbing their hands together and really looking forward to playing with him
542915 so sonny bill should steer away from no 8 for me it would be a big no no
542916 its a position you need to grow up playing youre a key linkman at no 8 and you make probably the most crucial decisions on the field with the nine halfback and 10 five eighth
542917 hed make a good no 6 thats a better position to learn the game but if it were over to me id put him in the centres thats his position i reckon
542918 i think it was a surprise to everybody even alinghi
542919 one last roll of the dice you go to the gallows after that one
542920 this is a situation that presents an opportunity for those two guys to put down their weapons and for alinghi to reach out to oracle
542921 but i want to see over the next few weeks what the moves are
542922 right now we dont have a relationship with them and theres been no communication between us and them this year
542923 dunno they could but i dont know i think were a long way from that though its getting a long way down the speculation line
542924 we want to survive and the conditions weve been put in make it difficult for us to survive
542925 there are other teams afloat but not at the level we are and we cant sit like this forever with money going out the door
542926 if this delay continues well have to take further steps to stay viable i couldnt continue to cash burn at the rate im doing and continue to survive but we wont be easily knocked over
542927 its not only the high cost of food but the high cost of every other activity people are staying around their homes and looking to do things they find rewarding
542928 i think the thing that tipped the scale was the fuel and food costs
542929 you bet youre life im gonna cry you bet your life i will thats my boy thats my boy right there
542930 my dad always used to give me and my sister advice like most kids we didnt always follow that advice
542931 a piece of advice he gave me once was never make athletes your heroes because they make mistakes too i guess i didnt follow that advice very well id like to introduce you to my hero my mentor my father
542932 my late grandfather is still my hero i remember those long hot summer nights sitting on the porch listening to a game or a fight
542933 he taught me about honor commitment love religion and respect
542934 it happens when youre protecting someone like john elway and what happens is the night before the game you get little or no sleep
542935 because if you didnt do your job youll forever be known as the guy who lost our franchise i would also like to thank john it was worth every sleepless night
542936 in my youth i watched every game i could i studied all the great players lambert ham
542937 lesser known gem is home to spectacular scenery a world class ski resort and one of a kind wilderness expeditions
542938 the team reports it found just what it was looking for on may 7 more than 2 5 ounces of marijuana being shipped from girdwood to dillingham with an ultimate destination troopers say of togiak
542939 you saw the little kids up there and there is way more kids than that there is so many kids that lose their dad and i just want their dads to come back with my dad
542940 we are ready to go and do what we have to do so hopefully our kids dont have to go and do that same job
542941 they started midway through my career so i havent given them the priority like i do a major or care about like a major
542942 but they are always the best fields in the game theyre always on great golf courses theyre always on tough tests so i think theres a lot of merit to whoever wins those
542943 ive been a long time doing this so it would be nice
542944 im proud that ive won on every tour basically i havent won a world golf championship so it would mean a lot and obviously give me a massive amount of confidence going into the next week
542945 a few short putts here and there would have made a big difference
542946 sometimes it doesnt go your way sometimes somebody else plays a little bit better
542947 i expect at least one and probably two or three us to have good rounds in the 60s tomorrow and force the guys behind us to catch up with birdies
542948 i think the discussions are moving ahead and i hope we have something resolved by monday
542949 i think the discussions are moving ahead and i hope we have something resolved by monday
542950 the parking garage design and evolution of a modern urban form
542951 i went back to triple a and got everything back together liriano said
542952 the big thing is that hes letting it go anderson said
542953 all three of his pitches hes letting it go the first time around in spring training and the first time up here he just didnt have the trust to cut it loose have extension and finish off his pitches
542954 i thought it was going to be easier to come back he said
542955 you kick your hat and then all the havoc that went on afterwards i figured id get a little bit of a fine i didnt know about the suspension
542956 ill give it a try just to see what it says
542957 youre a nun you weigh 128 lbs you are going to chicago
542958 youre a nun you weigh 128 lbs you are going to chicago youre going to play a fiddle

542960 youre a nun you weigh 128 lbs youre going to chicago you are going to break wind
542961 ive never broke wind in public a day in my life

542970 then i went to paris again to play as a guest soloist for a few weeks and it was during this trip that i met french filmaker louis malle through juliette greco he told me he had always loved my music and that he wanted me to write the musical score for his new film lascenseur pour l chafaud i agreed to do it and it was a great learning experience because i had never written a music score for a film before i would look at the rushes of the film and get musical ideas to write down since it was about a murder and was supposed to be a suspense movie i used this old gloomy dark building where i had the musicians play i thought it would give the music atmosphere and it did

542978 a grand salon a throwback to new york of old
542979 ask the average guy if he knows or has heard of rubin chances are he has but not rattner
542980 i think little by little this organization is starting to realize the importance of pitching
542981 statistics have shown the lack of it theyve always had a good offense but it all comes back to pitching but theyre making strides and making moves in the right direction
542982 ive got a lot of faith in these guys there is a lot of talent in this clubhouse and a lot more in the minor leagues i think were headed in the right direction
542983 i have a lot of respect for him but weve got to go on this is not the last time a lot of these guys will see changes made in the middle of the season but whether you agree or disagree weve got a ballgame tonight and weve got to finish the season were 4 1 2 games out of the wild card and in the middle of a pennant race its exciting
542984 its not going to be easy hes not a miracle worker we just want him to piece some stuff together and see of we can get better
542985 i dont like walks i learned that from hall of fame manager dick williams that was always his philosophy you cant defense hitters you have to go after these hitters attack them aggressively and challenge them these guys have big league stuff and big league stuff gets big league hitters out if used right
542986 these two guys are going to get the same level of respect dom and mark got from everybody here
542987 were definitely going to listen to them and try to learn from them i know hawk from spring training and being around here and having talked to him he was a major league pitcher so its good from that perspective i know hes a good guy
542988 we have a game to play tonight definitely well try to get to know these guys as well as possible as quick as possibly but weve got games to play and weve got to try to go out and win tonight
542989 we wanted to challenge him against more advanced hitters and felt it was a good time
542990 basically we thought it was valuable for him to have an adjustment period at triple a and give him a taste
542991 if he does well in this last month at triple a we know we can count on him to be in the mix next spring for a spot in the rotation at the same time if he struggles a bit we know hell be back at triple a next year
542992 its a bit more challenging with it being a throwing elbow
542993 his arm will be good from a throwing standpoint when he can throw to the bases and his elbow will be good from a hitting standpoint when he can take unrestricted batting practice
542994 hopefully he can start a rehab assignment late next week
542995 depending on how rehab goes will depend on how we work him back into play
542996 it wont be normal he wont be catching every single day
542997 we can be a bit more aggressive in our hitting progression if his strength is approximately 75 percent of his left shoulder or higher
542998 he would be scheduled to start throwing simulated games i would say in early to mid september
542999 and yet few politicians have seemed inclined to address solutions particularly if those solutions involve a modest individual sacrifice
543000 since taking steps to make his home more environmentally friendly last june gore devours an average of 17 768 kwh per month 1 638 kwh more energy per month than the year before the renovations by comparison the average american household consumes 11 040 kwh in an entire year according to the energy information administration the cost of gores electric bills over the past year topped 16 533
543001 i came up with one more energy related prediction the greatest self propelled vehicle ever invented the bicycle will experience a major renaissance
543002 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
543003 though realizing that many other factors were involved i reasoned that if we could get a freer flow of trade freer in the sense of fewer discriminations and obstructions so that one country would not be deadly jealous of another and the living standards of all countries might rise thereby eliminating the economic dissatisfaction that breeds war we might have a reasonable chance for lasting peace
543004 the greatest act of political courage that i have ever witnessed
543005 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
543006 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
543007 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
543008 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
543009 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
543010 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
543011 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
543012 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
543013 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
543014 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
543015 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
543016 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
543017 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
543018 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
543019 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
543020 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
543021 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
543022 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
543023 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
543024 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
543025 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
543026 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
543027 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
543028 you know its not about you its about your country

543034 green homes are shining through as the bright spot in an otherwise gloomy housing market
543035 this twin crisis of peak oil and climate change is spurring innovation experimentation and excitement
543036 these big challenges are what the u s is best at frankly
543037 by providing guidelines and strategies in essence our job is to keep saying yes its possible heres how
543038 there are a zillion different codes and standards out there
543039 we want to make it much easier for people to adopt our goals
543040 the move on organization espouses a radical left agenda and attacks those who oppose that nonsense
543041 i couldnt get over the fact that there was no difference between sylvias restaurant and any other restaurant in
543042 instead of black and white americans coming together white americans are terrified theyre terrified now we cant even say youre articulate we cant even give you guys compliments because they may be taken as condescension
543043 we live in a world where black intelligence is called into question even at the highest levels
543044 y oure generalizing do you know how often my intelligence is called into question doctor
543045 for three decades ive heard speakers say things similar to what ive heard today thirty years ago they were called doomsdayers today we know enough to respect their opinions but we still havent changed our lifestyles i take good care of my clothes and they last a long time i have short cold showers and i dont own a car these solutions arent complex theyre right before every one of us
543046 beware of those powers which come from god but which can so easily be purloined by the devil
543047 a certain quality of an individual personality by virtue of which he is set apart from ordinary men and treated as endowed with supernatural or exceptional powers or qualities
543048 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
543049 we could further increase the value and efficiency of a unified national grid by helping our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars an electric vehicle fleet would sharply reduce the cost of driving a car reduce pollution and increase the flexibility of our electricity grid
543050 hi mom this is john doe your son you believe me dont you
543051 oil generates only 3 percent of our electricity therefore a 100 percent renewable electricity system does little to reduce our oil dependency
543052 we can not drill our way out of this crisis regarding oil
543053 americans hate being dependent for our mobility and therefore for our livelihoods on countries often hostile to our way of life
543054 until youve heard andy debate al gore you havent lived
543055 water pow front porch bands beliefs station conversation newteevee station
543056 i had other priorities in the 60s than military service
543057 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
543058 the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist
543059 it was made into a bad movie in the 1970s starring the admirable george c scott
543060 but i have always been convinced that theres a great movie in this book and this is the one we are going to make
543061 i said from the start if we got the boat right then the rest would fit into place it has to go from being a fishing boat in the first half of the film to a war vessel in the second half it was vital to me that it was genuinely built before the second world war so the hunt was on from the moment we got the go ahead for the movie
543062 its a 38ft american motor cabin cruiser a wooden hull 11 ft beam 3 ft draught a perfect match to the boat hemingway described
543063 it used to have a four cylinder flathead chrysler diesel engine but someone replaced it with a v8 general motors gasoline car engine it turned the boat into a virtual bomb it looked like a bucket of rusty bolts so i sent some guys to move it to a good boatyard
543064 it was 12 knots on a boat which was not seaworthy after a nine hour journey we navigated in by torchlight to the new yard
543065 we will then take her to an undisclosed location and protect her like an unborn child
543066 but it means that you will see 27m of the 32m on the screen there are certain things that are meant to be and if youre lucky enough in life to eventually get there then that is a great achievement this is the project that is meant to be for me
543067 i put a lot of myself in to those roles
543068 in the valley of elah was an important film because we were looking at how the iraq war impacts on local communities across america with the loss of family members its a tragedy that carries on
543069 he is so focused tommy never wants to waste time and sometimes we were having a bit too much fun for him
543070 my belief is that we should never waste a day
543071 and when you are working and acting is our work there should be total concentration on what you are trying to achieve anything less than that then you are cheating yourself and short changing others
543072 in the end i didnt think i could make it as a professional sportsman so i thought that acting could make a great alternative life
543073 its still sport of a kind with winners and losers you also have to be fit to survive its not that first or second part or even big role which is so difficult its maintaining it over years
543074 no im a private person i hate everything about this business that intrudes on my life including these interviews but i do them to promote the movies because it helps people im fond of
543075 there is a terrific battle between an 11 year old boy and a 1 000lb blue marlin which i am looking forward to filming that is when the boat comes into its own
543076 this movie might be set in the past but it is about you and me now
543077 it is not a chick flick not a thriller killer not a quirky romance
543078 i want it to be a really good movie exciting from minute to minute frame to frame this is for people who want to see something different
543079 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
543080 right now we have more fuckin women in jail for selling sex than we have men that rape mutilate kill women
543081 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
543082 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
543083 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
543084 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
543085 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
543086 it is true that youngs rhetoric during a time of war was part of the backdrop against which the massacre happened
543087 no faith believing mormon could ever acknowledge brigham youngs complicity in the massacre and no gentile could think otherwise
543088 we are going to be arguing about the details for another 151 years
543089 a systematic effort to cover up and destroy records diaries and court records of the day
543090 we have got to give a lot of credit to the lds church for stepping up and owning the mountain meadows massacre
543091 this is something that has been swept under the rug denied and hidden for 151 years this book represents a real paradigm shift and thats remarkable
543092 we came up with the idea for the book ourselves we were not assigned to do it
543093 we sought the cooperation of church leaders to get access to information such as the first presidencys confidential collection but asked that we retain full editorial control and theyve honored that
543094 the trio of authors has properly tagged direct responsibility for the massacre on local church leaders and nauvoo legion officers with southern paiutes playing a minor role
543095 i give credit to the authors for this somewhat nontraditional view as well as their willingness to rescue the reputation of the victims from the appalling vilification thats taken place for 150 years they have also identified the impact of gov brigham youngs overheated rhetoric and provocative actions in helping to create a violent atmosphere in utah leading up to the massacre
543096 make obsolete previous studies and without doubt will constitute the necessary starting point for all future ones
543097 our marching orders as i understood them were to find the truth and tell it thats what we have tried to do
543098 my feeling is the best approach is to face it
543099 its a terrible sad story and a hard one to read we cant condone what they did but we can try to understand it good history brings you into the story in a way that you can understand yourself you should wonder what would i have done had i been there
543100 its a tough business those guys worked their butts off goose worked with me last year and helped me with my throwing anything you needed they were there to work with you on it
543101 in my time here i thought those guys were always well prepared and you know it was up to the pitchers to perform those guys really helped me prepare and helped me a lot with my game calling
543102 i guess somebody had to take the blame but its not like they were the ones throwing the pitches ive played here and i know how hard it is with the way balls fly out of this stadium its just the nature of the business
543103 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
543104 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
543105 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
543106 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
543107 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
543108 spoiler is a word of political bigotry i dont recognize it at all
543109 i dont think small party candidates or third party candidates are second class citizens
543110 spoiled our political system theyve turned the government over to big business
543111 none of us should be considered spoilers unless we all are spoilers
543112 it seems a vicious circle if youre not on the debates you dont reach tens of millions of people i can guarantee you if i was on the presidential debates the polls would surge
543113 are you a sports fan do you know any sports player who gives up
543114 why is obama not doing better in the national polls after his overseas trip
543115 is mr obama really struggling are these summer polls truly evidence of underperformance or fundamental weaknesses in his campaign
543116 voters might just not be ready to make a decision quite this early
543117 the idea was simple give u k readers frustrated with the bush administration a way to help drive him from office the left wing newspaper targeted one swing county in one swing state in ohio and invited readers to send one on one letters to independent american voters
543118 the response was huge and immediate more than 11 000 guardian readers across britain and soon around the world signed up for the project but almost as soon as operation clark county was announced right leaning media and bloggers counterattacked they masqueraded as interested lefties and got the paper to hand over some of the voters addresses
543119 consider this stay out of american electoral politics unless you would like a company of us navy seals republican to a man to descend upon the offices of the guardian bag the lot of you and transport you to guantanamo bay where you can share quarters with some lonely taliban shepherd boys
543120 in 2000 al gore won clark county by 324 votes
543121 kerry won every gore county in ohio except clark nowhere among the gore counties did more votes move from the blue to the red column than in clark
543122 so why isnt obamas camp and the democrats offering a more spirited defense is the party too smug or cocky or decent to roll up its sleeves and fight fire with fire
543123 cheering hooting and salivating youd expect at a campus rally
543124 while obama got a warm and even rousing welcome the audience was not cheering his every word
543125 one sure way to get applause from the crowd in the cavernous skyline ballroom for the opening ceremony was to mention sundays appearance
543126 many journalists in the audience leapt to their feet and applauded enthusiastically after being told not to do so during a two minute break halfway through the event journalists ran to the stage to snap photos of obama
543127 obama received a standing ovation from many in the audience at the start and end of his appearance there was also a rush toward the stage after his speech as obama shook hands and signed autographs one journalist was also overheard wishing him luck while another squealed he touched me as she left the ballroom
543128 lets put a man on the moon in 10 years
543129 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
543130 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
543131 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
543132 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
543133 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
543134 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
543135 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
543136 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
543137 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
543138 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
543139 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
543140 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
543141 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
543142 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
543143 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
543144 im convinced that the marketing and pr experts surrounding the obamas clued in to the enormous influence that celebrities have had on the american public particularly women over the past seven years since the emergence of us weekly star and other celebrity newsweeklies and the subsequent explosion of celebrity news and they want to take advantage of the deep affection that americans have developed for celebrities
543145 more than most presidential candidates the obamas have to introduce themselves and make sure the american public is comfortable with them they havent been on the national stage that long
543146 and they need to go in short lead publications like people and us weekly they cant wait another month or two for monthly magazine interviews they want the american public to understand who they are and who they are as a family immediately
543147 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
543148 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
543149 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
543150 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
543151 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
543152 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
543153 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
543154 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
543155 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
543156 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
543157 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
543158 has provided documents to the campaign as it combs through his background according to several sources close to kaine sens evan bayh ind and joseph r biden jr del are also being seriously vetted by the campaign staff according to sources with knowledge of the process
543159 to recap kaine was a city councilman in richmond for 4 terms a two term mayor of richmond lieutenant governor of virginia for 4 years and governor of virginia for 3 years no al gore there
543160 doesnt have to be pro choice or pro gay rights
543161 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
543162 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm
543163 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
543164 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
543165 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
543166 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
543167 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
543168 believe that coupling an investment in alternative fuels with increased domestic production of oil is preferable to alternative fuel investment combined with energy conservation alone
543169 the only way to break free from the burden of rising gasoline prices and electricity rates is to get free
543170 bid up the price of every last drop of oil and every last lump of coal
543171 by 1985 enough millions will have died to reduce the earths population to some acceptable level like 1 5 billion people
543172 we have to offer up scary scenarios make simplified dramatic statements and make little mention of any doubts we may have each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest
543173 lacks the qualities needed to lead britain effectively through its current economic problems
543174 browns hypocrisy is much closer to the classical sense of the term which involves not believing what you say
543175 answering clintonism with ken starrs inquisition impeachment was offering a cure worse than the disease
543176 i told them i was appalled by such a statement we are talking about taxpayers dollars that must be treated with as much transparency and openness as possible and spent with as much due diligence as possible to assure the best return on those tax dollars
543177 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
543178 dr zawahiri was enjoying a meal when the earth suddenly heated up by several thousand degrees
543179 the way it happened makes al gore look like a prophet
543180 dr zawahiri was enjoying a meal when the earth suddenly heated up by several thousand degrees
543181 the way it happened makes al gore look like a prophet
543182 but i resent when you throw out stupid allegations that have no merit and really no purpose other than to inflame
543183 for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father rom 8 23 and not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body rom 9 4 who are israelites to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of god and the promises gal 4 5 to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons eph 1 5 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will
543184 i object to the gentleman from california vote being counted he came down and voted late he said he was not in the chamber when his name was called and therefore hes not entitled to vote
543185 cleve youre wrong chet was back there behind the rail and i was standing by him when he answered his answer just wasnt heard
543186 you have a talent for leadership bob the country needs young men like you in the leadership of the nation
543187 after about a year i became disinterested quit paying my dues and dropped my membership in the organization during the nine years that have followed i have never been interested in the klan
543188 the klan is needed today as never before and i am anxious to see its rebirth here in west virginia and in every state in the nation
543189 you have a talent for leadership bob the country needs young men like you in the leadership of the nation

543192 ive always said this document and the holy bible theyve been all the guidance i need
543193 much to be thankful for theres not much i wouldnt do over
543194 we just ask that in the end gods grace shines upon us
543195 he said and taking one hand to steady the other he slowly scratched his name on the gift thank you senator byrd http my barackobama com page community post jefferyfloyd ggbfbb aug 2 2008 at 8 50 pm
543196 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
543197 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
543198 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
543199 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
543200 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
543201 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
543202 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
543203 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
543204 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
543205 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
543206 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
543207 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
543208 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
543209 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
543210 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
543211 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
543212 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
543213 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
543214 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
543215 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
543216 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
543217 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
543218 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
543219 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
543220 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
543221 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
543222 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
543223 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
543224 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
543225 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
543226 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
543227 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
543228 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
543229 i think we should be in a post racial environment
543230 i think sen barack obama has done an admirable job of that i dont think he has race baited i think he has been very good about that
543231 the presumptive republican nominee has embarked on a bare knuckled barrage of negative advertising aimed at belittling mr obama
543232 if the shareholders of the new york times ever wonder why the papers ad revenue is plummeting and its share price tanking they need look no further than the hysterical reaction of the papers editors to any slight real or imagined against their preferred candidate
543233 sitting at home in his mothers basement and ranting into the ether between games of dungeons amp dragons
543234 sen john mccain of arizona is the only republican who promises to end the george bush style of governing from and on behalf of a small angry fringe
543235 mccain is still i think upset about the op ed not being printed
543236 a lot of the maverick positioning is now turning into more conservative positioning and some of that includes not being afraid to go negative not being afraid to call a liberal a liberal and not being afraid to go after a newspaper
543237 latte drinking sushi eating volvo driving new york times reading
543238 has really become a symbol for a lot of conservative grievances
543239 for starters their editorials are decidedly liberal thats a no brainer and there are often complaints that even their general reporting is biased in subtle and not so subtle ways the new york times has come to be associated with the northeast liberal establishment
543240 the higher cost of crude oil used in the refining process was not fully recovered in the price of gasoline and other refined products
543241 as a result our downstream operations incurred a loss in the second quarter with most of the loss taking place in the united states
543242 while some might have chosen to exhaust their legal options to try to force their way into the games jessica instead chose to put her teams interests ahead of her own
543243 ive never wanted to do anything remotely close to doping its never ever crossed my mind ive never been approached about doing it its never been an issue my entire career its the last thing i would ever do
543244 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while
543245 this puts a key part of the dashboard in place
543246 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic
543247 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history
543248 evidence of a failure by government and society to do what it takes to control the epidemic
543249 we have been inadequately funding this epidemic all along we need to step it up
543250 everybodys trying to figure out how to lower levels of acrylamide without significantly adversely affecting taste
543251 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
543252 in no way do i think john mccains campaign was racist i think they are cynical
543253 their team is good at creating distractions and engaging in negative attacks
543254 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
543255 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
543256 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
543257 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
543258 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
543259 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
543260 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
543261 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
543262 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
543263 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
543264 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
543265 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
543266 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
543267 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
543268 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
543269 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
543270 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
543271 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
543272 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
543273 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
543274 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
543275 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
543276 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
543277 liberals believe in free speech individual liberty religious freedom the right to make a living
543278 gore s talking about electricity generation and what hes really substituting out is one of our most abundant resources that makes us energy independent and thats coal
543279 and if oil can be obtained from our own domestic locations either the outer continental shelf or anwr or oil shale in utah and the rockies and it can be done without environmental harm now not 100 percent guarantee of no environmental harm but reasonable kinds of risks of environmental harms that would not be catastrophic then why wouldnt we why wouldnt we do that
543280 we need to explore all avenues that we can for energy many factors should be taken into consideration it has to be safe cost effective and timely we cannot be limited in our thinking
543281 did democrat mary landrieu not read the gore memo she now 21 years later for the purposes of reelection wants drilling in the gulf she and democrats have oppposed it for 21 years vote em out and join drill now drill here polar bears eat the baby seals democrats protect how stupid of democrats to save everything and lose their own souls respectfully john mcintyre
543282 how soon we forget old gore has lost it take a look at his scare brain ideas he tried to legislate when vp population control acid rain etc and now his global warming placing the blame on we the people have you read the scientific reports who disagree its costing us billions amp we the people are paying for his errors
543283 i think coal is a very good partial solution to our energy needs there is coal for hundreds of years there is also a system close to final stages of development that will use electron technology to remove toxic pollutants so2 and nox as well as particulants this system is near production just a couple of miles from congress at escrub in alexandria va add this to wind solar hydrogen nuclear and domestic oil and we would have a smooth steady and possible transition to the future sources that are not available now
543284 how thankful i am that god did not allow gore to be elected to an office
543285 dr chiltons ideas are practical and need to be implemented without further delay
543286 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
543287 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
543288 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
543289 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
543290 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
543291 after an exhaustive review of a substantial body of climate research and in conjunction with the obvious and compelling new evidence that exists it is time that the world community acknowledges that the earth has begun its next climate change in an opinion echoed by many scientists around the world the space and science research center ssrc today declares that the worlds climate warming of the past decades has now come to an end a new climate era has already started that is bringing predominantly colder global temperatures for many years into the future in some years this new climate will create dangerously cold weather with significant ill effects world wide global warming is over a new cold climate has begun
543292 as a dissenting physicist i simply can no longer buy the notion that co2 produces any significant warming of the atmosphere at any rate
543293 on a global basis sea ice anomalies in may 2008 continue to be above the long term average during the 1979 2008 satellite period the 10th highest on record
543294 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil
543295 americans deserve policies that free us from fossil fuels and give us better choices that will bring down our energy costs make our air cleaner and help solve global warming
543296 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is just so absurd
543297 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
543298 mr gore proposed dramatically improving our national electricity grid and energy efficiency while investing massively in clean solar wind geothermal and carbon sequestered coal technologies that we know can work but just need to scale
543299 were building up co2 so rapidly that were seeing the consequences scientists have long predicted
543300 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
543301 what if we could use fuels that are not expensive dont cause pollution and are abundantly available right here at home we have such fuels scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of us electricity demand geothermal energy similarly is capable of providing enormous supplies of electricity for america the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses today i challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
543302 mountaintop mining is an atrocity its part and parcel of the energy system thats causing global warming and the same moral blindness
543303 is one of the most difficult multi task activities known to man and not everyone is wired for it
543304 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
543305 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
543306 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
543307 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
543308 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
543309 is that the right kind of signal to send to the young people of this country who more than any time in recent memory are deeply involved in the political decisions that were making this year and young people who want to get into the political arena look to al gore and he said its all about trivia and nonsense
543310 the new internet based forms of organizing and mobilizing people
543311 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
543312 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
543313 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
543314 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
543315 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on but overall i mean ive always been a supporter of nuclear power and he has not agreed with that
543316 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
543317 john mccain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming five years ago
543318 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
543319 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
543320 let me just say again sen obama no storage and no reprocess and thats nuclear power no drilling offshore thats a way of finding oil and gas reserves dr no
543321 a solution that handles all framing sites not just the ones i know about
543322 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
543323 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
543324 so anyways this is als crowd because of course he invented the internet
543325 our favorite question if meat causes more carbon emissions than cars what should we do
543326 its outright pathetic to see so many comments attacking the messenger rather than debating the ideas
543327 both are serious and must be addressed that having been said i think that the climate crisis is by far the most serious threat we have ever faced
543328 well ive endorsed barack obama im a democrat but i think that john mccain deserves credit for having provided some leadership in the republican party years ago at a time when it was needed
543329 youre looking at a different list than i am ive decided to impose a personal term limit of two terms as vice president
543330 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
543331 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
543332 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
543333 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
543334 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
543335 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
543336 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
543337 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
543338 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
543339 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
543340 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
543341 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
543342 but you can put it on the agenda and try to move the country
543343 a 90 percent chance that the us has contributed 2 degrees f of temperature increase in the last 50 years
543344 what a great big long grand x you have dear n
543345 and the quickest and easiest way to back out the coal which is the worst of the problem and oil is to look at electricity generation
543346 i also think that the coal and oil industries can play a big role in this if they will make good on the promise that carbon capture and sequestration will be real
543347 first canis focaccia no cheese is italian pizza is american
543348 america is a deeply racist society and whites are to blame for all of the social problems befalling blacks
543349 the girl at the front just told me there is nothing under my name i told her that maybe it was under yours but she said there was only one room under your name and that youd already checked in

543378 i cant believe im saying this but i think that is a great idea
543379 please let it go michelangelo youre letting them bring you down to their level
543380 russell mesler is a lawrence resident and an emeritus professor in kansas universitys department of chemical and petroleum engineering
543381 bozo your ad hominem comment directed against professor mesler is not only out of line
543382 were spending 1 trillion a year on the war department
543383 where does uranium fuel come from canada australia the former soviet union and africa the last time i checked how does this make us less reliant on foreign sources how long is the uranium supply supposed to last at current consumption 50 years
543384 did none of you read that even at 100 utilization of wind energy in kansas is is 384 mwatts
543385 misinformation is wrong or inaccurate information it is distinguished from disinformation by motive misinformation is simply erroneous while disinformation in contrast is intended to mislead
543386 i guess we can understand why mr mesler has a vested interest in supplying this bit of disinformation
543387 please explain what ive read is the true 100 utilization of wind energy would meet all of kansass energy needs with plenty left for export
543388 offset and with all the availble energy you can only offset 20
543389 wind energy only and the countries with wind energy are using it to
543390 asbestos and the columnist talked about the subsidies that wind gets
543391 they just got 10 billion taxpayer dollars in the energy policy act of 2005 to jumpstart the moribund industry and utilities were given until the end of 2008 to sign up for a new nuke and qualify for the huge taxbreaks cost sharing and risk insurance protection in the package
543392 sorry dude but that was the point of the article there is only 386
543393 1 3 wind turbines will not produce power efficiently below a wind speed of 15mph they must be disengaged at wind speeds over 50mph to prevent damage to the turbine they also require a fairly demanding amount of maintenance
543394 wind and pv systems should be installed in every house in the united states for those people that want to participate to offset their energy bill
543395 short term threat to the growth of wind energy is the looming expiration of federal tax credits at the end of this year but the wind industry should not ask for more government support it should be made to stand on its own
543396 have you conducted an energy audit on your system capital operational maintenance revenue all in joules if your system doesnt produce more energy than it took to make maintain operate and dispose then dont bother
543397 asbestos i stand by my talking about per capita energy consumption and california per capita consumption has stayed flat for the past 30 years look it up
543398 as a taxpayer this is a poor use of my monies and i might add it a poor use of my monies collected by utilities as a ratepayer
543399 http www nrel gov docs fy00osti 28085 in state wind energy potential 235 200 mw capacity after land use
543400 wind energy away pretty clear that the author was correct and he was stating in the 300
543401 http www nrel gov docs fy00osti 28085 in state wind energy potential 235 200 mw capacity after land use
543402 that means that the state has 235 gigawatts of wind energy potential 1 gigawatt is 1000 megawatts look it up
543403 if al gore is upset about carbon we must need more of it
543404 my bet would be on policy decision as usual however
543405 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
543406 this is where terrorists can plan attacks they have sanctuary here they are gathering huge amounts of money as a consequence of the opium drug trade in the region
543407 i would look to be able to make recommendations to president bush in the fall to continue those reductions
543408 certainly there are assumptions which you could make which would make that possible
543409 i dont think theres any doubt that we were distracted from our efforts not only to hunt down al qaeda and the taliban but also to rebuild this country
543410 the interesting thing is that the people who are very experienced in foreign affairs i dont think have those doubts
543411 the troops that ive been meeting with over the last several days they dont seem to have those doubts
543412 im not yet able to put an exact time line on it per se
543413 i think the strategic goals of having time horizons are ones that we all seek because eventually we would like to see u s forces draw down and eventually all come home
543414 the day is coming when american forces will step back more and more from combat roles the day is coming when will be doing more in the way of training and less in the way of fighting those goals are being achieved now
543415 senator mccain and i and others want us out of iraq sooner rather than later
543416 but we want us out in a way that does not compromise all the gains that american and iraqi forces have made in iraq w e want to stay there to a victory because we dont want all those who have served in the american uniform there to have served or in some cases died in vain
543417 i think its important to note that barack obamas judgment about these issues has been excellent from the beginning the kind of judgment youd want in a commander in chief and others are now beginning to adopt his positions
543418 we wouldnt be discussing surges in iraq or anything else if barack had had his way we wouldnt have started that war to begin with
543419 thats not the sort of thing you say no to
543420 if john asks me and he thinks i can help him
543421 we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
543422 this climate crisis is threatening our country threatening all of human civilization
543423 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
543424 the devastating effect on main street and the rest of the country is coming from the present cost of electricity
543425 the price increases are likely to continue until we stop just taking baby steps
543426 the focus now is past president bush toward whats going to happen in january
543427 i disagreed with those who wanted a so called gas tax holiday
543428 the people of this country are ready for bolder more dramatic actions
543429 im under no illusion that theres any position with as much influence as that of president and in fact i tried to get that position but that didnt happen
543430 but i personally feel that my own best role is to try to bring about a sea change in public opinion
543431 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
543432 okay weve got it from here you can leave now
543433 when two elephants fight its the grass that suffers the most
543434 remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
543435 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to conduct targeted counter terrorism missions against al qaeda in iraq and to protect american diplomatic and civilian personnel
543436 as an active member of the armed forces i believe that admiral michael mullen should refrain from political speeches and campaigning its the law and its a good one i am tired of having our servicemen and women used as political footballs if mullen wants to enter the campaign then he can retire and comment to his hearts content
543437 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
543438 even those who back aggressive steps to combat climate change viewed the proposal with some skepticism they said the proposal was impractical and far too costly
543439 the nations senior military official warned against a plan to remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
543440 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
543441 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
543442 who wants to exit in a quicker way has a better assessment of the situation in iraq
543443 if we dont get our way we will bomb you
543444 i want this job done in 18 months now tell me how you are going to do it
543445 there is no mountain over which you can see the future
543446 hey make this pg or ill cut your balls off
543447 i am looking for the jock that goes with the strap that is lying on the floor
543448 please use public transit bicycling or other climate friendly means
543449 have to go back 15 years to find ice expansion so far south
543450 responsible individuals throughout the industrialized world are trying to come to grips with the harm being done to the global environment
543451 his velocity isnt up to where it should be but give him time and hell get back whats he got three blown saves this season thats not bad at all
543452 what i see is a guy who believes in himself since hes been here ive seen him 91 92 mph if he can get back there itll be nice
543453 we can do him back to back days but not three straight days
543454 if i get him up to pitch tonight and dont use him i wont be able to use him tomorrow though
543455 we were up twice and gave up the lead twice but if we face him again well do the same thing
543456 the dia research dates from 1976 and shows the dangers were known about over twenty years ago the soviets used the frequencies and intensities used by mobile phones 1800 mhz and 900 mhz as weapons it is a rule of the intelligence community that you hide things in plain view getting the public to accept microwave mind control weapons which affect their behavior under the guise of mobile phones was a stroke of genius getting the public to pay for these microwave mind control devices so their brains and behavior can be damaged to make them more docile and easy to control was pure diabolical genius
543457 what happens when the fbi spends millions of dollars targeting an american citizen for an illegal cointelpro operation while perpetrating precedent setting violations of that citizens constitutional rights yet fails to arrest that person the fbi then uses the media to slander the targeted person and coercion to blackmail those around the target including the targets family into keeping silent in regard to the torture they are being subjected to in efforts to drive them to suicide such precedent setting crimes are now being perpetrated against my person by the fbi nsa amp dhs you could be their next victim
543458 the indigo blue ribbon campaign to promote the awareness of people targeted for mind control amp organized stalking crimes
543459 what is the us federal government doing using satellites to spy on americans within the privacy of their own homes this has been occurring since long before the 9 11 attacks black operations which were an inside job perpetrated to keep the war on terror open ended so that the illuminati run us federal government can continue to erode our freedoms under the pretext of protecting us from an invisible enemy
543460 it is illegal amp against its charter for the nsa to spy domestically unless it receives permission from the fisa court to do so and then only if it can prove that the american citizen to be placed under surveillance is in contact with an international terrorist so exactly what is the nsa doing illegally spying on myself and millions of other unwitting americans
543461 nsa personnel can dial up any individual in the country on the signals lntelligence emf scanning network and the nsas computers will then pinpoint and track that person 24 hours a day the nsa can pick out and track anyone in the u s
543462 the followings a diagram of the type of mind control software that agencies like the nsa utilize on targets of illegal mind control research any american citizen can be targeted for this satellite based weaponry at any time without their knowledge or consent
543463 we need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society the purpose is physical control of the mind everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated the individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence but this is only his personal point of view this lacks historical perspective man does not have the right to develop his own mind this kind of liberal orientation has great appeal we must electrically control the brain some day armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain
543464 consider the damage done to us as a people by the us congress cia fbi dod nsa and dhs alone the biological chemical and electronic warfare that they have subjected so many of us to the illegal and humiliating nsa satellite spying of us within the privacy of our own domiciles the inhumanity of their mind control torture the complete manipulation of the us economy through the illuminati controlled federal reserve bank and irs and the treasonous crimes committed by them through the improperly ratified and unconstitutional federal reserve act the us federal governments usurpation and manipulation of the us media through the cias operation mockingbird the abject treason of the attacks on 9 11 and one can only arrive at the following conclusion only a population that is either extremely ignorant of the facts or masochistic would ever allow for a government which is such anathema to exist within their country
543465 so to begin i want to state the most basic of all facts about brainwashing in the entire history of man no one has ever been brainwashed and realized or believed that he had been brainwashed
543466 nothing would warrant the monitoring of individuals every minute habit 24 7 unless theyre us intelligence doing illegal inhumane testing
543467 the most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed
543468 the extensive crimes against humanity which the us federal government controlled by the privately held federal reserve bank has perpetrated against the american people which includes the crime of menticide are so far reaching that in most instances its beyond their comprehension the people of this planet must stop thinking in groups amp starting thinking for themselves the illuminati has us convinced that we should be fighting eachother as in making war on other countries when it is the illuminati which operates through our banking systems amp governments whom we should be working to destroy
543469 these guys are professional liars who have raised selected memory loss to an art form
543470 with the creation of this website ive done the best i can to document the nsas illegal spying and mind control operations which adversely affect myself and myriad other americans in the present day there are also citizens from many other countries reporting this same phenomenon
543471 as for the 9 11 attacks with the satellite spy technology that the nsa has incorporated into its echelon spy system there is absolutely no way that this agency would not have known about the attacks on 9 11 before hand if osama bin ladin was really behind these attacks as we have been told the nsa could have immediately disabled him through the use of directed energy weapons technology bin laden like lee harvey oswald was nothing more than a lightening rod used to cover up yet another major us intelligence black operation perpetrated against the american people

543473 fuck i want him to strip me naked pull me over his lap and spank me fuck i am so hard
543474 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits
543475 fuel prices have doubled in the past year a successful hedging programme mitigated the impact but nevertheless fuel costs at 706 million were up 233 million in the quarter we expect our fuel bill to top 3 billion this year the equivalent of more than 8 million every day
543476 its likely they will be the three appearances by the candidates this fall
543477 we understand it might be beneath a worldwide celebrity of s magnitude to appear at town hall meetings alongside john mccain and directly answer questions from the american people but we hope hell reconsider
543478 obviously we would have to think through the logistics on that but if i have the opportunity to debate substantive issues before the voters with john mccain thats something that i am going to welcome
543479 people who do the work in america will never be invisible to the democratic party
543480 they are working longer hours than ever even as they are asked to meet a new and growing set of caregiving responsibilities
543481 as we meet our country is in the sixth year of a two front war our economy is struggling our planet is in peril these challenges and many others demand new leadership
543482 if you want to say invisible americans i think obama was supportive of issues for the invisible americans if you will from the beginning
543483 hey lets do the same thing only get a girl whos more sluttier and has fake

543489 are you ever going to show us your house now that you are done painting you said you would

543495 they are still present with us at weddings and first communions
543496 for me winning the olympics is really my biggest ambition as a cyclist
543497 im happy in myself in what i have achieved in the sport but i suppose winning in beijing would promote my achievements beyond the world of womens cycling
543498 i think weve got perhaps one of the strongest teams on the start line so its a fantastic opportunity
543499 it will mean that we will have a better chance of choosing the right race strategy whereas when you are by yourself youve only really got one option you have to stick to that option and hope its the right one
543500 with a team around you can cover everything we may not quite be able to dictate the race but we can have a very strong influence on how we want the race to go thats a big change in terms of the approach to the race and then when were actually in the race the knowledge that you have two people with you who you can call on and work together with is a big help
543501 if we can put the other teams on the defensive so that they are then reacting to our game plan hopefully one of us can pull it off
543502 what is very clear about cycling is that my chances will be increased by teams having to react to sharon and emma
543503 ive got a very good picture of it in my mind but i need to spend a bit more time going over it
543504 its very important to study the course so that it becomes second nature and is one less thing to think about during the race
543505 i think there are a couple of other riders who have the favourites tag but what a lot of people dont know about is the amount of background work weve been doing as a team and in terms of our race plan i think we do have a great chance
543506 providing our customers with options to stand out from the crowd and show a true expression of themselves is what makes this sidekick such an intriguing fun device

543529 left behind black america a neglected priority in the global aids epidemic
543530 we are 30 percent of the new cases among gay men 40 percent of the new cases among men in general 60 percent of the cases among women and 70 percent of the new cases among youth
543531 american policy makers behave as if aids exists elsewhere as if the aids problem has been effectively solved
543532 more black americans are infected with hiv than the total populations of people living with hiv in seven of the 15 countries served by pepfar
543533 were black america a separate country it would elicit major concern and extensive assistance from the u s government instead the national response to aids among black americans has been lethargic and often neglectful
543534 the u s response to the epidemic in black america stands in sharp contrast to our response to the epidemic overseas
543535 i think there are important parallels between the epidemic in africa and the epidemic among black people in the united states
543536 in a lot of places it is a generalized epidemic
543537 the report cited numerous other similarities between the african and african american epidemics
543538 the federal governments approach to the epidemic in black america is fundamentally flawed
543539 black women often cannot insist on abstinence or the use of condoms for fear of violence or other emotional trauma
543540 we have focused on abstinence only methods even though they dont work in our community
543541 cdc prevention efforts have really tried to follow the epidemic
543542 it is a crisis that needs a new look at prevention
543543 america itself has no strategic plan to combat its own epidemic

543667 quero fazer um primeiro esclarecimento outros presidentes tamb m n o concederam entrevistas coletivas desde 1999 acho n o se fazia uma
543668 voltaria a faz lo porque pela primeira vez desde o advento da democracia em 1983 as institui es se dispuseram a discutir seriamente com a possibilidade de ser sancionada uma lei que previa a redistribui o de renda
543669 ter instalado o debate sobre como distribuir a renda excepcional na argentina
543670 o problema da concentra o da riqueza em um mundo cada vez mais complicado em mat ria de alimentos e de energia vai exigir desta presidente e do que vier depois a o
543671 um instrumento de pol tica econ mica para preservar o direito alimentar dos cidad os
543672 este um pa s exportador de alimentos com a modifica o dos termos do interc mbio comercial come a a press o sobre os pre os internos porque querem ter o maior excedente export vel poss vel
543673 certo grau de ingenuidade diante da rea o de setores muito poderosos amea ados em seus privil gios
543674 quando algu m v o filme completo todo o conflito observa que os que sa ram ganhando com a queda do projeto de taxa o foram os exportadores os setores mais concentrados da economia
543675 a argentina um lugar de investimentos por ser altamente competitiva
543676 o fato de termos vis es e processos diferentes n o significa que n o possamos articular projetos
543677 it takes things that are very standard and usual and things that kids all the time in saratoga and makes them accessible to kids by putting at their speed their size they get to see exactly what if feels like to stand next to a tire
543678 its great that the kids can actually climb onto the trucks and just experience what its like
543679 well who doesnt like to get on a school bus and reminisce about the old days climb up onto a big digger and get an ice pop from a stranger its just fun
543680 quero destacar a firme convic o de quem fala ela e do presidente lula de que a integra o importante na vis o dos dois pa ses
543681 o assunto em doha era o que colocavam os pa ses desenvolvidos nessa negocia o e o que os pa ses emergentes colocavam mas n o era um bom neg cio para os pa ses emergentes e especificamente para a rep blica argentina com um desenvolvimento industrial inferior diferente do que tem o brasil
543682 hoje por suas pol ticas constantes o brasil tem uma empresa como a embraer e n s n o temos nada por isso temos que aplicar medidas que sejam permanentes no tempo
543683 a import ncia da argentina como um pa s altamente competitivo
543684 recentemente o presidente da fiesp federa o das ind strias do estado de s o paulo paulo skaf disse numa entrevista a um jornal argentino que a argentina hoje muito mais competitiva que o brasil na hora de se investir
543685 e isso tamb m muito importante para a integra o
543686 e tamb m quero ressaltar a visita do presidente ch vez acho que a integra o da venezuela ao mercosul algo mais que importante especialmente num momento em que o mundo discute energia pre os e alimentos
543687 voltaria a fazer todas as coisas que fiz e tamb m diria que voltaria a aplicar a resolu o 125
543688 quando kirchner chegou presid ncia em 2003 tamb m diziam que eu mandava que eu chamava os ministros que eu gritava com eles
543689 mas n s dois somos militantes h muito tempo e defendemos com id ias a sociedade que melhor queremos para a argentina para nossos filhos
543690 meu pai saiu de casa com 16 anos ele nunca mais voltou
543691 eu fico contente por meus filhos terem uma oportunidade a mais do que um brasileiro m dio
543692 eles sabiam que ia vir um brasileiro nossa brasileiro joga futebol a me viram com essa cara de brasileiro
543693 brasil dif cil eu fui perceber o quanto eu sou brasileira aqui na china
543694 ela faz uma feijoada ela faz uma rabada ela faz uma polenta a cozinha brasileira t o rica e alivia a saudade de casa
543695 padaria da esquina n o tem lugar melhor no mundo meu deus do c u
543696 tenho saudade do brasil mas quando estou l sinto falta daqui tamb m
543697 volver a a hacer todas y cada una de las cosas que hice ustedes y much simos argentinos se preguntar an pero igualmente volver a a impulsar por ejemplo la resoluci n 125 de las retenciones m viles y yo les dir a que s porque por primera vez desde el advenimiento de la democracia en 1983 las instituciones nos hemos puesto a discutir en serio con posibilidades de ser sancionada una ley que por primera vez tocaba la redistribuci n del ingreso
543698 revela la firme convicci n de ambos de que la integraci n es una necesidad
543699 nos alegramos mucho de las inversiones de todo tipo no solamente de brasil sino tambi n de otros pa ses de hecho en el primer semestre de este a o comparado interanualmente con el primer semestre del a o pasado hemos crecido en materia de anuncios de inversiones en un 72 por ciento y lo curioso es que el 85 por ciento de esos m s de 13 mil millones de d lares de inversi n son de origen extranjero
543700 cerrar la ecuaci n energ tica en am rica latina
543701 es algo m s que importante y tiene que ver precisamente con esta ecuaci n energ tica alimentaria e industrial
543702 e es una preocupaci n latente de hecho hay un fuerte impulso a la creaci n de una junta de defensa de la am rica del sur creo que es importante
543703 el socialismo hay que pensarlo hay que planificarlo con el m todo cient fico con profundo empe o diario permanente y consistente
543704 estoy convencido frente del tim n central de este barco que se llama venezuela que estamos en condiciones de entrar ya en ese nuevo periodo de la revoluci n
543705 ya estamos en condici n de fortaleza en todos los procesos en lo pol tico en lo econ mico en lo social
543706 no est bamos listos para hacerlo en la dimensi n que se pretendi
543707 el socialismo hay que pensarlo hay que planificarlo con el m todo cient fico con profundo empe o diario permanente y consistente
543708 con trabajo y m s trabajo para tener patria paciencia y m s paciencia constancia y m s constancia planificaci n y m s planificaci n acci n y m s acci n para tener socialismo
543709 los medios de comunicaci n de este pa s en nada se diferencian a los medios de comunicaci n privados que tenemos en venezuela con una campa a medi tica tratan de desvirtuar la realidad del proceso de construcci n y transformaci n que estamos viviendo en venezuela
543710 hay una buena relaci n con preacuerdos que a n est n por materializarse la labor que ha venido haciendo el gobierno bolivariano ha recorrido el mundo tratando de que venezuela alcance el lugar que le corresponde y que no ocup durante tantos a os
543711 ya tenemos 10 estados donde se logr una alianza perfecta y tengo la absoluta convicci n de que el lunes se va a anunciar luego de la reuni n otro importante n mero de estados donde tambi n habr una alianza perfecta
543712 i have to accept that i appear to be the fall guy and may be the fall guy
543713 i suspect an agreement has been reached or an understanding has been reached
543714 it may well have been done by the executive board done in another place by very senior people in the ioc it may have taken into consideration new circumstances in this year leading up to the games where there has been quite a lot of trauma around china and within china
543715 this certainly isnt what we guaranteed the international media and its certainly contrary to normal circumstances of reporting on olympic games

543736 happiness is your dentist telling you it wont hurt and then having him catch his hand in the drill
543737 fox by its mere existence undercuts the argument that the public is starved for fair news and not just because fox shills for the republican party and panders to the latest of americas periodic religious manias the key to understanding fox news is to grasp the anomalous fact that its consumers know its news is made up fox television showed us the future outright lies and paranoid opinions packaged as news under the oversight of rupert murdoch a flagrant pirate and roger ailes an unprincipled nixon thug who had assumed a journalistic disguise in much the same way that the intergalactic insect in men in black shrugged into the borrowed skin of a hapless hillbilly

543786 youre walking out on him he needs you in there by his side right now and youre out here polluting the air
543787 well if it isnt too much to ask of you when youre finished acquiring cancer come back inside and be there
543788 dont make the faces your father makes may or youll make the angels cry
543789 its okay noodles the angels hate your mommy and they laugh when she makes herself look like a retard
543790 your mommy touches your daddy in the way that makes him say oh
543791 i dont know may maybe you should ask katie since she seems to know so much about it while youre on the subject you should ask her where babies come from
543792 like the eggs in the refrigerator when a mommy and daddy want a baby they plant the egg in the ground and a bush will grow when the time is right the mommy and daddy pick the baby out of the bush and start a family
543793 im going to go talk to bri so i want you to go downstairs and make nice with your new roomies
543794 because i like to look at your pretty little face
543795 came a voice from my doorway startling me so badly i was surprised i didnt jump clean out of my skin
543796 well i guess i cant say andrew has bad taste in women whats wrong with your eye
543797 really was it with another girl was there mud involved
543798 uh i dont mean to be rude but why are you here
543799 because if you do thats fine just say the word
543800 actually i spose it would be words seeing as how
543801 he began sitting down in the center of my room
543802 i take it you havent had much of a chance to interact with people
543803 i mean your background whered you come from what happened to you
543804 ah come on youve been following him around everywhere all day
543805 take into consideration sir that hes the only one of you guys who i even slightly know
543806 ah its okay its about time he moves on anyways
543807 he didnt say anything about an ex er a girlfriend
543808 they fought a lot and it was a pretty messy breakup
543809 say anything about her yeah gotcha the first time he probably wont say anything about her either even if you ask him i think it still bugs the shit out of him to be honest
543810 nah hes not as strong as he seems hes actually pretty fragile once you get to know him
543811 i know arent i so right around the time bri moved in with us andrew started going into town a lot said it was errands or something related to the king or something which was a load of shit anyways about a month later he brings home this blond broad whos fucked up twice as bad as anyone already here and lets her move into this room
543812 that bitch was bipolar or something she could turn from night to day in the blink of an eye hot to cold red light green light in any case katie had a fit and hibernated in her room for about a week which sucked nuts because i was elected chef boy r kenny in her absence
543813 oh i sucked harder than a prostitute on a saturday night anyways that crazy whore had been diddled by daddy a few too many times raped by the neighbors son gotten into all sorts of drugs the list goes on but wed be here for days
543814 sad thing was andrew once he has his heart set on something he just doesnt give up until its hopeless
543815 yeah they were having a really bad fight one night when all of a sudden she just stormed out crying which was kinda weird because she never cried after that andrew was pretty bad for awhile and we havent seen her since
543816 thats nice so if she were to come back and find me in her old room
543817 lindy shed kill ellie here if she saw how close were sitting
543818 uh yeah its nice change is good especially in here
543819 are you guys ready for dinner katie said its ready if you are
543820 watch your damn mouth kenny do you want kenny jr talking like that
543821 piss off fucks going to be his first word or his middle name i havent decided yet
543822 since bri isnt here to yell at me i get to be king tonight
543823 your king treats you kindly here are 2 more helpings for the fatty
543824 she doesnt like my food whats wrong with your kings food
543825 she hasnt had a chance to try it yet katie she wouldnt know what was wrong even if there was anything wrong with it
543826 she was talking with me earlier maybe she loses her voice after dark
543827 what when you were telling her how crazy lindy is
543828 i think thats a lie kenny why dont you tell me what you told her hmmm
543829 nothing for me to worry about hmm well then if i am worrying about something you can sleep on the couch until im not worried anymore
543830 i finally admitted causing everyone to look up at me
543831 i did is that why youre so big then because you eat so much
543832 i went to school until i was 8 and was locked up for the past few years
543833 its not going to be a kenny jr thats just retarded
543834 you dont even know if its going to be a boy we told bri to keep it a secret until after the birth
543835 unless lindys been sleeping around again its mine and hers
543836 jr is what you put at the end of a baby boys name if the parents want to name it after the father
543837 the king suggests naming the unborn serf after the king
543838 actually isnt it custom in families to name their first son after the favorite uncle
543839 i think you should name it after this lasagna guys
543840 this is the best thing ive ever had in my life
543841 actually i like alyssia or alexandria if its a girl
543842 well let me see if i can describe her nicely she was definitely passionate about the things she believed in she could yell really loud she uh had a nice ass
543843 i didnt like her hun hard to say nice things about those you have nothing nice to say about
543844 keep it in your pants woman this is classified information here
543845 of course i like him he brought me here hes nice to me hes my friend
543846 how do you feel about andrew in comparison to ah say me
543847 oh youve got it bad youve got it so bad and hard kid
543848 whatre you doing down here i thought you were going to set up the crib
543849 i thought we were going to put it in a spare room
543850 we can later i wanted to steal ellie from ya for a bit and go shopping in town with her
543851 shutup she needs to bond with females not monkey people
543852 dont bother girl hes in bris lab right now you wont be able to speak with him until theyre done
543853 theyre talking dont get worried bri doesnt get too personal with anyone were all test subjects to her
543854 i love this girl shes like a puppy or something
543855 now be a good puppy and come with me into town andrew will be fine because kenny will tell him where we went then we can get you some new clothes so you dont have to wear haileys leftovers
543856 but he doesnt like hearing her name so we usually refer to her as the bitch slut whore yknow
543857 dont wear them too long you may get some leftover bitch on you
543858 you baby duck was let out to play by lindy
543859 shes definitely better than the last one you brought home
543860 dont kenny i dont want to talk about dark times
543861 well lindy really likes her she thinks shes her new dog or something
543862 as long as she doesnt try to put a leash on her
543863 nah i dont think shed need to ellie goes wherever shes wanted without a fuss although i think thats because she doesnt know any better
543864 call it a hunch but i think shes got a little crush on ya
543865 oh come on its not like shes hiding it or anything she doesnt even know what it means to like someone as more than a friend you should teach her bro isnt it time you moved on anyways
543866 no i mean what i cant i mean what no
543867 you are aware that you just made no sense whatsoever right now arent you
543868 kenny i dont think im cut out for that sort of thing yknow i just make trouble
543869 why because in your first relationship your girlfriend was an absolute bitch
543870 and she look i dont want to get into that its hard to think about i just dont want you trying to play matchmaker or put stupid ideas in ellies head okay
543871 i think itd be good for you i think shed be good for you look at yourself man youre already so much happier
543872 over her but im not so sure im over what happened with her what she put me through
543873 so youre going to hold any other girl who shows and interest in you accountable to that thats not fair
543874 yknow kenny i seem to recall not being the only one here with girl issues
543875 the baby just kicked again he should know about it
543876 but its kicked 6 times today already and you called him every one of those times too
543877 he should know what his child is doing he did this to me so he should share in the bliss im feeling
543878 kenny it just kicked again yes i know ive already called about it today well you should know fine then sleep on the couch again tonight too
543879 youre the first girl ive ever really talked to before
543880 love is my baby thats what love is to me accepting someone for who they really are flaws and everything included i also think that love may be more of something that you do at the same time as being a feeling and i dont mean that in a dirty sense but when kenny came to find me when i ran away that was love of course kenny probably has a different definition of love than me and andrew and katie i think everyone has to find their own definition
543881 i think andrew wanted to help her more than anything but she hurt him pretty bad i havent really seen him happy since that happened until you moved in why
543882 i dont mean that sort of like sweetie i mean youre starting to fall in love with him
543883 i what no i dont even know what it means
543884 think about it hun you get jealous of his old girlfriend youre with him all the time and the times youre not with him youre talking about him i dont know why i didnt see it before
543885 well no one knows how silly goose if it happens it happens you cant help it
543886 but i dont like it the feeling i feel when you guys talk about hailey
543887 i know that feeling well come on we need to be home before the sun sets or the boys will be worried
543888 yeahhhh first we went into the trading market and i got to pick out some clothes and there was this guy and he said he thought i was pretty and nobodys ever told me that before so i said thank you and we found more clothes and had lunch together and i had some chicken that was ok and then we found some more clothes and lindy found some baby outfits and called you a trillion times and then we were coming home and theres really a baby in there
543889 he said slowly probably afraid that if he said the wrong thing it would trigger me into another explosion
543890 if theres an off switch on this woman id like to know where it is
543891 it was fun though usually people are mean to me but today they were smiling at me and giving me things
543892 thats because i was there behind you paying for everything you touched
543893 lindy took me into town it was really fun a boy thought i was pretty
543894 i took her into town with me dont give me that look she wouldve asked you if it was alright had you been available
543895 hes a smart man he knows not to mess with you
543896 im showing lindy here how much i like her you should try it
543897 no not really i just wanted some new clothes and lindy said she could take me shopping so i said okay
543898 alright alright me and you can go to the dump sometime and throw them away how does that sound
543899 before i say anything i have to ask you something
543900 kenny did he said its to show someone you like them and i wouldve done it to him and lindy but they were already doing it to each other
543901 heres a lesson for you dont ever listen to anything kenny says ever
543902 look about that just now maybe if you want to let me know you like me just tell me
543903 uhh kissing is something that boyfriends and girlfriends do together thats why kenny and lindy were doing it
543904 well i that is ahh look its just something thats special for one person something that most people do with only that other person otherwise if you do it with everyone it isnt as special anymore does that make sense
543905 because i asked i wanted to know and you wouldnt tell me
543906 maybe i have my reasons for keeping things from people
543907 why do you keep asking i dont want to talk about it
543908 i dont want you getting caught up in my past
543909 let someone in again did she hurt you that bad
543910 remember last week when we first met you didnt trust me at all because you were afraid id hurt you you were miserable with where your life had taken you because all you knew was pain thats me almost exactly
543911 i know this because the day i met you and the way you were so cheerful and untroubled i think that was you being how you really are like you didnt have a care in the world
543912 maybe i was just being like any other guy out there and getting excited about taking home a pretty lady
543913 what happened to that i dont trust anyone front you had up awhile ago
543914 im sorry you seem to think im a happy person but it seems to me that youve been fooled by the mask i wear to trick everyone else
543915 forget about her whatever she did to you that hurt you so bad forget about it right now
543916 you want me to jump on my bed with you
543917 i feel like ive hit rock bottom sometimes and it makes me want to cut everything out of my life
543918 im stupid unless i get hurt i dont learn and the more i get hurt the deeper i sink it just doesnt end
543919 how am i supposed to help you im shorter than you are
543920 i realize this but you can climb up on the washing machine
543921 i think he and kenny were talking outside on the porch why
543922 yeah im getting nervous about all this baby coming business its really going to happen soon
543923 are you guys really going to stick it in a closet i know your closet is about as big as some of the rooms but it sounds kinda cruel doesnt it yea i put my kid in the closet
543924 its happening faster than we were prepared for i dont think theres much time left to move things around even if we wanted to plus lindys been suckering ellie into decorating the walls up with baby things painting and whatnot shes actually a pretty decent artist
543925 god no she cant paint a stick figure ellie on the other hand shes basically amazing
543926 of course i will kenny what exactly am i helping with
543927 well yeah im going to help but what makes you think ill know more about taking care of a kid than you
543928 i was wondering which outfit you liked better whats wrong whatre you doing are you going somewhere
543929 well take a jacket and some money silly it looks like it may rain outside
543930 ellie wait no its going to rain and its cold out
543931 i said no so lets go back inside you can go into town with me some other time
543932 why do you care if i go into town i can take care of myself
543933 and i dont want to stay here right now so let go of me
543934 what do you think do you think im her running off into town to visit my other lovers well im not so you can stop treating me like her
543935 go after her do you want to lose her run
543936 he trailed off water dripping down his face at a steady pace now
543937 ellie just took off and this jerkoff isnt doing anything about it
543938 she was acting funny when i found her by the door
543939 we need to find her come on babe well be back
543940 this is why i dont want people in my past
543941 maybe if you hadnt acted like you wanted her in your life when you really didnt you wouldnt be in this situation now
543942 no kenny its not fair to ellie she really liked you andrew weather you were ready for someone new in your life or not she didnt know the difference you acted like you were but you never told her the truth
543943 i i told you t that i was a b burden why w why did you take me home w with you if you didnt want m me
543944 when i first met her i ran into her in town just like i did with you which might have been why i was so happy to have met you
543945 no theyd just all scream at each other and katie would more often times than not end up crying but hailey did hit kenny a few times which really pissed me and him off so when she started sneaking into town on a regular basis kenny let his big nose get the best of him and convinced me to follow her into town to figure out what she was doing
543946 she was cheating on me with a lot of different guys to get her drugs
543947 yea i ignored it for awhile she knew that i knew about the drugs but she wasnt aware that i was aware of why she went into town every other night so when i started telling her not to go into town shed get really mad at me
543948 three days later she went back into town i was i didnt know what to do when she finally came home 2 days later i told her i knew she got mad at me for spying on her so when i told her i wanted bri to do a paternity test she really got mad she told me that if i made her take the test and it really was my kid shed have bri abort it
543949 no we only did it twice with protection but i took the opportunity to kick her out which was really bad
543950 its okay ellie because despite what she did to me
543951 im sorry i didnt trust you will you come home with us
543952 i i cant ellie h how can i do this
543953 n no not that im im n not ready for this im i dont k know
543954 whats all the noise in oh sick are you having that thing in here
543955 why cant you have it in bris lab im trying to make dinner in here
543956 andrew said as tall frizzy bri started pulling things out of the boxes
543957 i cant use that couch anymore do you know that are you aware you dont even care i like that couch
543958 i paused to look up at andrew who smiled and nodded at me
543959 welcome home mayuka youll like it here i know it
543960 la magnitud del efecto fue bastante similar al de la hipercolesterolemia o hipertensi n
543961 your eyes are smashed closed i can tell youre awake
543962 i garbled out my mouth obviously hadnt realized that i was functioning again and had a hard time forming coherent words
543963 you surprised me when you took off after me people normally dont do that more or less they engage in quite the opposite
543964 the last person i saved from the forest ended up running straight into the wall and knocking herself back out again
543965 that was it youre my second is there some rumor about me in town ive gotten a few screamers while i was collecting things in the forest a couple of times now
543966 well i used to be an imperial guard at the castle but a lot of really weird things started happening around the boarding bunks for which i received the blame the kings adviser wanted me banished from the kingdom said i was cursed but the king pitied me he informed me of this old abandoned shack and said that if i could stay inconspicuous i could remain within the kingdom so i moved out here and here i am
543967 well when this all started happening i began sleepwalking a lot
543968 anyways when i started sleepwalking there would be minor problems in the morning like a broken this or scratched that i dont know if it was me or not because nobody saw me doing anything wrong but if it was me i can accept that
543969 yeah things would go missing and turn up by my bunk people were assaulted in the middle of the night and then another guard my room mate was found dead in the bunk above mine one morning and i was covered in his blood when i woke up so logically i was blamed for it
543970 im sorry thats not a good position to be in
543971 i have my reasons to believe that im not all bad
543972 youre weird then again i knew that when you chased me through the forest definitely a first for me whyd you chase me anyways
543973 you mean the other little corner of your home over there
543974 hey fs while youre in there can you get me some more nuts yknow for nutty goodness
543975 i dont like that im going to keep calling you fs
543976 im surprised that the bump isnt any bigger youre lucky
543977 unless you would like to walk back to your house by yourself in the dark
543978 brekky can wait cant you collect it on the way back from my house
543979 look youre lucky im letting you stay the night in my home its dangerous out there so just stay put
543980 because ive been doing this every other night for a year i know how to handle myself
543981 stupid rat bastard leaving me here by myself then again you cant expect much manners from the wise man of the forest
543982 i have always reacted negatively to those who with their snotty noses and erotic fantasies prowl into others lives
543983 blacks are significantly less likely to feel that their marriages are harmonious and are significantly less likely to be satisfied with their marriages
543984 there is almost complete consistency in the racial differences in outcomes that can be considered measures of psychopathic personality
543985 the spread and establishment of c ohridella is of particular concern
543986 because once established the moth appears always to maintain exceptionally high rates of infestation without any evidence of decline in european towns and cities there has been no decrease in populations even after many years and severe damage to horse chestnuts has occurred on an annual basis greatly impairing the visual appearance of the trees

543988 n o acabou nem o primeiro turno no ano passado o flamengo terminou o primeiro turno na zona de rebaixamento mas acabou o campeonato em terceiro lugar nada est definido n o estamos nem na metade da tabela
543989 n o acredito em sorte e nem em azar mas em compet ncia e trabalho n o temos que dar desculpas e sim bater no peito e dizer que o erro nosso
543990 temos que assumir para melhorar n o existe nenhum outro fantasma
543991 s o erros individuais que a gente n o pode cometer n o vou enumerar foram as falhas mas foram as mesmas que nos valeram as derrotas contra cruzeiro 4 a 2 coritiba 2 a 1 e vit ria 2 a 0 estamos muito vulner veis nosso sistema defensivo faz poucas faltas
543992 nossa distribui o foi claramente deficiente faltou qualidade no passe a bola nem chegou no nosso ataque foram erros demais o volume da equipe saiu prejudicado
543993 richmod is another club with more than a passing interest in brown in this the last uncompromised draft for some years
543994 and heres another thing this might mean nothing at all but when richmond played carlton at the g at the end of june brown was sitting in the stands among the crowd
543995 its none of your business what other people think of you
543996 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
543997 i am yet to watch a single wwe show where punk is treated like a top guy
543998 raw was not just bad it was a i cant believe this made it on air type of bad
543999 todd grisham did fine as play by play and tazz seemed to enjoy working with him
544000 it sounds like alot of what your saying is a bout marriage and not that i dont want that im just not thinking about that now
544001 i thought we started dating because we made each other happy and enjoy being together

544014 in terms of getting a job knowing how to write is a good thing

544020 i dont like our chances acp magazines publishing supremo pat ingram revealed last week
544021 anyway facebook has had crushing success while myspace continues to grow
544022 the judges had a tough job this year every contestant was gorgeous
544023 but we couldnt have picked a better winner given her name and genuine personality sara was destined to take home the crown
544024 just write it down write down how much you want to make this year
544025 whos the fall guy now coyote ugly did you guys hear that i just said that
544026 in fact the apple at amp t partnership is going so well that at amp t managed to wrangle another year of exclusivity out of apple extending its us monopoly on the iphone at least until 2010 this extension is part of the iphone 3g deal that eliminated revenue sharing with apple but has at amp t paying about 300 per phone up front the numbers continue to look good for both parties with the iphone generating almost twice the revenue as the average at amp t wireless customer then again its hardly a surprise its not like betting on steve jobs tech business savvy is that much a risk these last few years
544027 i said if youre worried about my confidence please dont be
544028 ive felt like ive thrown pretty well recently i told him ill do whatever they want me to do but id want to make sure i get some save situations
544029 anyone down there can be used anywhere im not going to make a blanket statement and say youre not my closer street could still close games if you have a closer whos struggling a little bit and lately a couple of guys who are hot you can switch it around a little bit
544030 i have to look at the film i really do
544031 its hard for me ive watched so many things its not fair for me to say matter of fact every now and then i look up to see who threw a ball and theyre already over talking to mike martz and im not sure which one it was because they turned again i cant say
544032 im open to all three right now and thats where my mind set is as were all anxious to get to one i am and then again im not i want to know if we do have to get to another if we get to a second quarterback or a third something like that this is not just trying to find out whos one this is also trying to find out who gives us a chance our very best chance to win
544033 hes athletic hes got a strong arm hes a good decision maker and he has a good grasp of what the overall scheme is trying to accomplish he is a feisty competitive quarterback
544034 he knows whats going on he does a good job of anticipating routes and where guys are going to be
544035 one i just like the competition and being in the elite level of something it just happens that its football two i think i can play here i dont like somebody else telling me im not good enough
544036 in the past when i havent played or been a backup ive always felt if i can keep improving thats all i can control
544037 tom brady was an even better player than i expected him to be
544038 competes every day at practice every day if he falls down he scrambles up and makes a play he plays the game just like he practices
544039 hey listen every year its the same thing were out here to win thats our no 1 priority
544040 hes got his job right now hes got a contract and hes expected to win the 49ers are expected to win
544041 he tries to do a lot of things to keep the defense off guard
544042 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
544043 you have value on the ground more than you spent
544044 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
544045 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
544046 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
544047 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
544048 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
544049 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
544050 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
544051 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
544052 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
544053 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
544054 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
544055 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
544056 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
544057 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
544058 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
544059 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
544060 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
544061 i dont feel him in a way that i feel i have to call ghostbusters but ive been haunted by elvis in the sense that when i knew him he was very sweet but also seriously into drugs
544062 ive been haunted by wishing he could have lived longer because im from memphis and ive had the fame thing too maybe i could have helped him
544063 i love to surf i love to snowboard i love to play golf i love to hike id prefer to put on weight rather than lose it i like women with curves i want a big bum

544069 we learned from last week it was a learning experience for us all particularly for the coaches
544070 we changed our pattern and our kicking game paid dividends we took our opportunities this week and that last bonus point try was just the icing on the cake
544071 it was a pretty good performance from the all blacks
544072 they built pressure and they profited from that and didnt allow us to build pressure and they grew in confidence
544073 we came up a distant second here and we have some downtime before we go to africa and look forward to that opportunity
544074 caf con piernas es un tipo de local de expendio de caf o cafeter a caracter stico en chile el cual se distingue de los dem s por su atractivo de reemplazar cantineros y mozos por mujeres semi desnudas pero en algunos casos simplemente ligeras de ropa o desnudas su nombre proviene debido a que en la fachada del local por lo general de vidrio ahumado o una especie de biombo se protege la identidad de los clientes que se encuentren adentro frente a los transe ntes y solo se deja un espacio en la parte inferior por lo cual se ven las piernas de las mujeres que sirven el caf esto supuestamente es por una legislaci n

544076 i heard too many times if i dont have a boat and i dont have a camper what is there to do at rathbun lake so i decided getting together some bands out here ant getting people out to see how pretty rathbun lake was could help promote the lake and show people there is more to do than just boating and camping
544077 as attorney general i will do what i can to crackdown on medicaid fraud to make sure that we recoup dollars that we bring dollars back into the system so that we can restore healthcare for the senior citizens for the kids for the working parents for the persons of disabilities
544078 i think its a good opportunity for people in the community to save money and i think it does a really good job at keeping the money in the community people coming to out local malls than traveling out of town

544088 youre not ready to be mentally prepared for the physical exertion you feel and overcome that and the learning curve

544105 hasil rekaman kotak hitam pesawat sifatnya rahasia dan tak boleh dipublikasikan secara utuh rekaman kotak hitam diputar hanya untuk kepentingan investigasi ini sesuai dengan aturan penerbangan anex 13 dengan beredarnya isi rekaman kotak hitam berarti pemerintah indonesia dan knkt komite nasional keselamatan transportasi tidak bisa menjaga kerahasiaan dan ini menjadi persepsi negatif

544108 if i was a prudent businessman id think twice about adding people right now
544109 it the economy is sluggish and it looks like its going to remain that way
544110 if youre looking for a bright spot at least were still 1 6 percentage points below the national average
544111 wed better pray for lower oil prices because higher gas prices are a hidden tax on people and thats stopping people from spending money
544112 thats nothing compared with what we should be getting during the heat of the summer
544113 pleasure could slice up to 15 percent off your premium if consolidating errands into a single trip provide a new estimate to your insurer about how many miles you drive per year the federation estimates minnesota drivers could save between 44 and 133 using these methods
544114 driving would decline by an estimated 8 percent nationwide netting society the equivalent of 50 billion to 60 billion a year by reducing driving related harms
544115 roughly two thirds of households would end up paying less for auto insurance with each of those households saving an average of 270 per car
544116 my big problem is insurance companies are in the business to make money
544117 it really makes me a little more conscientious i dont speed very often
544118 i think its one more thing that might make you a better driver
544119 over time we think people have the potential to realize larger and larger savings as they just are more conscious about how they drive and when they drive
544120 as far back as the year 2000 the respondent has actually attempted to murder several other people either through poisoning he is a revenge killer when he feels that hes been slighted or has had especially toward women he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings
544121 has been forensically diagnosed by several top psychiatrists as a sociopathic homicidal killer i have that in evidence and through my working with him i also believe that to be very true
544122 thats right just dial 1 800 chosen 1 to meet girls who have this alarming yet fun condition
544123 what was weird was that the stories i was hearing about drought and farmers in desperation were very similar to the stories that had been told to me in india a couple of years before they were all about small independent farmers up to their eyeballs in debt they had borrowed hugely to make a go of it and then thered been a shock in australia it was drought in india it might be harvest failure in britain foot and mouth it only takes one small shock
544124 if i had been this popular at school id be a different man today
544125 i havent had a steak in my life growing up in a hindu household i clamoured for hamburgers like any other kid and my parents said oh if you must but they drew the line at steak
544126 but they were certainly driven out you cant compete any more the corner shop is a dying industry
544127 the figure that often stuns people outside the us when i tour with the book is that 20 of american fast food meals are eaten in cars people are incredulous and ask is that because americans so love their cars but living here you see how hard people work for a pittance with no healthcare no decent education not even a hint of a pension so its not surprising that the one hot meal you eat a day you eat off your lap thats where the food system becomes a lifestyle
544128 while we think our food is made for us we are in
544129 india has the most people in the forbes top 10 billionaires list but in the past decade the average calorie intake of the poorest has fallen there are levels of hunger we havent seen since the british left combined with the worlds highest levels of type 2 diabetes from the pressure of eating too much of the wrong kinds of food
544130 you are hearing these amazing stories of working american families adopting coping strategies that i learned about in development sociology skipping meals growing their own fruit and vegetables giving up on meat thats happening right here right now
544131 we could have seen it coming because of the biofuels policy which has always struck me as absurd or the rising price of oil or increased consumption of meat or weird things happening with climate but all these things happened at once and that sent food prices through the roof
544132 theres no reason why food prices should come down significantly and if they dont and theres no real impetus for governments to redistribute spending power people will continue to take to the streets
544133 those are the kinds of things that are anathema to the world bank and development analysts at the moment and congress normally doesnt want to hear them that they called on someone like me is very weird but very heartening
544134 weve got an energy problem a fuel problem a water problem and global warming all coming at us
544135 im big on science married to a neuroscientist i love it
544136 i like the way cuban science approaches the problem they say you can have gm crops if you can prove theres no better way of doing things so they dont not exactly a ringing endorsement for the value of science but then that is not where
544137 if we are choosing between coke or pepsi burger king

544176 particularly during the sars epidemic xinhua has for last few months been putting out news reports embarrassing to the government but they are designed to fool the international community since they are not published in chinese
544177 this is good news of course but it continues to be unacceptable that the chinese government can decide according to its mood which websites are censored and which are accessible
544178 and how long will these sites be available to the 253 million chinese internet users who continue to be subject to massive online censorship

544194 i couldnt have left tottenham for any other club i think that if i didnt come to liverpool id probably have regretted it for the rest of my life

544207 i went five or six days without pitching and it affected me a little bit but if i would have thrown a better pitch to gary sheffield on wednesday i would have gotten out of the inning
544208 i threw the pitch where it wasnt supposed to be
544209 i also feel better physically than i felt early in the year maybe because ive been used more times and im throwing more pitches more consistently
544210 the tips they gave me about my mechanics when i first got to cleveland are paying off

544213 i feel that this decision is biased racist political and disrespectful to this board and all stakeholders of this predominant black school district

544249 its downright sad that on a day when we learned that 51 000 americans lost their jobs a candidate for the presidency is spending all of his time and the powerful platform he has on these sorts of juvenile antics senator mccain can keep telling everyone how proud he is of these political stunts which even his republican friends and advisers have called childish but barack obama will continue talking about his plan to jump start our economy by giving working families 1 000 of immediate relief
544250 i think john mccain has harmed himself in the last week
544251 i think the discussions are moving ahead and i hope we have something resolved by monday i think weve gotten to the point where we kind of have to force it
544252 i was interjected into it because there was a tampering charge initially

544259 police chiefs shouldnt get involved in everyone elses business when it comes to their personal life its inappropriate
544260 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
544261 to me it was pretty shocking what were seeing suggests there may be a social connectivity constant for humanity
544262 people have had this suspicion that we are really close but we are showing on a very large scale that this idea goes beyond folklore

544291 gives us an amazing competitive advantage compared to where we are right now
544292 when i bought the team i said i wanted to put a competitive team on the field and i wanted to move back to new york
544293 so we spent the first six years trying to do that it was a fabulous effort we left no stone unturned
544294 i didnt get into this business to alienate anybody were going to try to be as receptive to any comments the fans made in this particular department i feel pretty good about coming out with something that is reflective of those values

544437 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices

544462 the more difficulties one sees in the world the more perfect one becomes the more you plough and dig the ground the more fertile it becomes the more you cut the branches of a tree the higher and stronger it grows the more you put the gold in the fire the purer it becomes the more you sharpen the steel by grinding the better it cuts therefore the more sorrows one sees the more perfect one becomes that is why in all times the prophets of god have had tribulations and difficulties to withstand the more often the captain of a ship is in the tempest and difficult sailing the more greater his knowledge becomes therefore i am happy that you have had great tribulations and difficulties strange it is that i love you and still i am happy that you have sorrows

544467 perhaps the most bizarre circumstances were the ones imposed by her school
544468 the most interesting aspect to this whole case was the fact that the judge took advice on whether the kara was a central tenet to the sikh faith it is

544513 because if you didnt do your job youll forever be known as the guy who lost our franchise i would also like to thank john it was worth every sleepless night
544514 in my youth i watched every game i could i studied all the great players lambert ham bobby bell and many others
544515 hes still playing great it happens in every sport when someone sets the bar so high guys find a way of creeping up behind you
544516 i dont think theres a huge difference between a semifinal and a final but to win it would be huge
544517 im going to have to play against one of the best players in the world to win it i feel like im playing well enough to do it
544518 ive been making sure i get ice on it after every match it hurts sometimes after matches
544519 sen barack obama is charismatic the carefully knotted ties and the dark conservatively tailored suits only accentuate the exoticness of his shamanism he has entered the american psyche not as a hero but as a healer
544520 the country or much of it has longed for such a figure a man from the once oppressed race whose rise to power will atone for the sins of slavery and racial stigmatization
544521 we all play the fool there is no exception to the rule

544524 scooby doo has enchanted generations of audiences for nearly 40 years and as evidenced by box office dvd sales and television ratings the franchise today is stronger than ever
544525 were delighted to extend the scooby doo legacy into another live action film and bring these beloved characters to an even greater legion of fans in an all new original movie
544526 this project is also an anchor component of our new push into movies our great partnership with warner premiere and the overall expansion of cartoon network programming efforts

544532 then he said he had to look at a lot of samples that the fbi had prepared to duplicate the letter material
544533 n or should we ignore the possibility that a us biologist may become disgruntled or turn rogue while working in one of these labs
544534 the fbi must not let the death of bruce ivins deter it from completing a full and thorough investigation of the attacks
544535 the chance to prove ivins guilt before a court of law has been lost but the need for a thorough investigation and a full accounting to the american people remains
544536 it appears increasingly likely that the only significant bioterrorism attack in history may have originated from right within the biodefense program of our own country
544537 memo written by assistant attorney general jay s bybee and addressed to white house counsel alberto r gonzales and the pentagons general counsel william j haynes ii bybee argued that that the war crimes act and the geneva convention did not apply to al qaeda prisoners the august 1 2002 memo to white house counsel alberto r gonzales from jay s bybee of the justice departments office of legal counsel concluded that techniques used to interrogate al qaeda operatives would not violate a 1984 international treaty prohibiting torture

544542 that was unusual for him not to call back and then when he didnt show up for work on tuesday we got worried
544543 he was a little guy with a heart bigger than you could know
544544 tim spent his life traveling and meeting new people and always saw the good in everyone he had the most infectious giggle you could hear him laughing a mile away
544545 it didnt matter what kind of a day you were having because when you heard him laugh you couldnt help but join in
544546 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around

544548 i wanted to get in the last group i like playing with eddie even though he outdrives me by 100 yards

544554 die vertr glichkeit der konkreten flugrouten wurde nie gepr ft und wurde wie alle anderen flugrouten auch ohne beteiligung der verb nde und anwohner festgelegt
544555 sind wir angetreten um im dialog mit dem flughafen und mit dhl l sungen zu finden wobei die gesundheit der anlieger nicht gegen wirtschaftliche interessen abzuw gen ist
544556 in kurzen zeitabst nden donnern bis weit nach mitternacht und noch vor tagesanbruch in geringen h hen lautstark flugzeuge ber die d cher der anwesen der betroffenen einwohner
544557 meine nacht war 23 47 uhr zu ende dies lag allerdings nicht an der umstellung der sommerzeit sondern am flugl rm von sch tzungsweise 15 flugzeugen die direkt ber unserem haus flogen und wendeten ich habe versucht dies zu ignorieren doch an schlaf war nicht mehr zu denken
544558 sogar von den positionslichtern der maschinen im bett angeleuchtet zu werden
544559 es ist wie im krieg ich halt das nicht aus
544560 damit entbehrt die von der b rgerinitiative verbreitete zahl von bis zu 100 berfl gen pro tag jeglicher grundlage
544561 es ist wie im krieg ich halt das nicht aus
544562 ich glaube es ist noch zu leise gegen den l rm weil ich sehr wichtig finde dass nach wie vor nachts ruhe herrscht und nicht wie bei uns in modelwitz alle zehn minuten m chtiger krach auftaucht
544563 des land wie die flughafenbetreiber sagen und da wohnen auch menschen jede nacht stehen wir gewehr bei fu und sind um unseren schlaf gebracht
544564 wenn ich st ndig l rm um mich herum habe werde ich krank dann werde ich nerv s dann kann ich nicht in ruhe arbeiten das mag ich nicht
544565 also aus sicht des umweltschutzes ist ein nachtflugverbot ganz klar zu unterst tzen es gibt studien die eindeutig die sch dlichkeit insbesondere im nachzeitraum von flugl rm nachgewiesen haben wir haben zum beispiel im vergangenen jahr eine studie im umfeld des flughafens k ln bonn durchgef hrt wo es darum ging die abh ngigkeit von nachflugl rm und arzneimittelverbrauch zu belegen
544566 man schleift gleis man ersetzt die graugussklotzbremsen durch andere bremssysteme graugussklotzbremsen haben die eigenschaft die radoberfl che aufzurauen denn raues rad auf rauer schiene erzeugt maximal den l rm und ich muss beides glatt machen um l rmminderung zu erreichen
544567 zu leise viel zu leise jedenfalls in der offiziellen politik die b rger beschweren sich in wachsendem ma e ber den l rm im rheintal gibt es so etwas wie eine rebellion gegen den schienenverkehr aus l rmgr nden das wird zum teil auch inzwischen in der politik reflektiert aber insgesamt kann man sagen der l rm hat eine politisch geringe priorit t in deutschland
544568 ich bin sehr verbl fft und erfreut dass so viele hierher gekommen sind obwohl in wenigen minuten ein wichtiges fu ballspiel angepfiffen wird
544569 die belastungen durch die flugzeugabgase sind seit april kaum noch zu ertragen
544570 es ist wie im krieg ich halt das nicht aus
544571 ein entscheidendes risiko f r die k nftige entwicklung der region im zuge der dhl ansiedlung ist dass die politik nicht zu ihren fr heren aussagen steht und zur ckweicht
544572 zwischen den beiden gro en st dten halle und der anderen
544573 wir erwarten dass uns die regionale politik weiter unterst tzt
544574 das expresstempo beim bau war nur m glich weil die unterst tzung enorm war
544575 eine einschr nkung von fracht oder gar kombifl gen w rde das ende aller logistiktr ume bedeuten
544576 wir haben beinah ausschlie lich westwind und dann fliegen die dhl maschinen teilweise im zehn minuten takt ber unseren k pfen den airport an
544577 der l rm mindert die lebensqualit t und der wert unserer immobilien sinkt
544578 eigentlich m ssten die flugrouten nur weiter nach s den ber weniger stark besiedeltes gebiet gef hrt werden
544579 es gab ein vollumf ngliches planfeststellungsverfahren mit einem schallschutzkonzept das weit ber die aktuelle gesetzgebung hinaus geht und 2003 eine h chstrichterliche entscheidung des bundesverwaltungsgerichtes die den ausbau zum frachtdrehkreuz erst m glich gemacht hat
544580 meine schlussfolgerung lautet die stellen ihre h user hin und ziehen weiter was aus den eigent mern wird interessiert die nicht

544589 resulta inconveniente e inoportuno emprender ahora una reforma a la justicia cuando la corte suprema adelanta investigaciones y juicios en contra de algunos congresistas
544590 solo se podr n estudiar los proyectos anunciados por el gobierno cuando se reciba un texto con un articulado completo de los temas acompa ado de los estudios que evidencien la necesidad
544591 la gente entra a las p ginas de los pol ticos y normalmente est n desactualizadas son jartas y aburridas no tienen fotos ni videos en cambio facebook es algo que se mueve todos los d as

544593 pens que ser a dif cil porque m s que todo hay mucha gente joven en facebook
544594 ha sido muy bonito tengo un mont n de amigos de mi hija que ahora son mis amigos me contact con ex alumnos m os de la universidad incluso dice emocionada me he encontrado con los hijos de mis compa eros de universidad y ellos ahora son mis amigos
544595 los j venes necesitan espacios para expresar sus opiniones y facebook llen ese espacio
544596 este medio invita a la gente a participar sin clientelismo
544597 est n perdiendo espacio la compra de votos el clientelismo y la corrupci n en la pol tica
544598 facebook no es tan serio prefiero mirar a la gente a los ojos

544606 with the liberal party youre dealing with not a question of personalities its policies mr rudd told the nine network
544607 what weve inherited from 12 years of mr costello as treasurer is the second highest interest rates in the developed world together with his being part and parcel of a government which was engaged in climate change denial and work choices mr rudd said
544608 so on that score i ve got to say its quite clear cut to me that the liberals whoever their leader is have a real problem with their policy direction for the nations future because of the legacy they left us from the past
544609 you had to play 42 to be in the family

544612 i dont think were that serious though this is the first time weve ever played in something like this
544613 i saw a flier for this at my husbands work and i thought my mom might enjoy coming
544614 the first thing were gonna do is find two people and teach them how to play

544636 our military organization today bears little relation to that known by any of my predecessors in peacetime
544637 or indeed by the fighting men of world war ii and korea we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
544638 government is not a solution to our problem government is the problem
544639 the expansion of private i e mainly corporate power and the selective abdication of governmental responsibility for the well being of the citizenry
544640 the privatization of public services and functions manifests the steady evolution of corporate power into a political form into an integral even dominant partner with the state it marks the transformation of american politics and its political culture from a system in which democratic practices and values were if not defining at least major contributory elements to one where the remaining democratic elements of the state and its populist programs are being systematically dismantled
544641 in 2006 the cost of americas spying and surveillance activities outsourced to contractors reached 42 billion or about 70 percent of the estimated 60 billion the government spends each year on foreign and domestic intelligence
544642 to feed the nsas insatiable demand for data and information technology the industrial base of contractors seeking to do business with the agency grew from 144 companies in 2001 to more than 5 400 in 2006
544643 if theres one generalization to be made about the nsas outsourced it information technology programs it is this they havent worked very well and some have been spectacular failures
544644 the key phrase in the new counterterrorism lexicon is public private partnerships in reality partnerships are a convenient cover for the perpetuation of corporate interests
544645 the separate bookkeeping and accountability devised for blackwater dyncorp triple canopy and similar outfits was part of a careful displacement of oversight from congress to the vice president and the stewards of his policies in various departments and agencies to have much of the work parceled out to private companies who are unaccountable to army rules or military justice meant among its other advantages that the cost of the war could be concealed beyond all detection
544646 bill clinton picked up the cudgel where the conservative ronald reagan left off and took it deep into services once considered inherently governmental including high risk military operations and intelligence functions once reserved only for government agencies by the end of clintons first term more than 100 000 pentagon jobs had been transferred to companies in the private sector among them thousands of jobs in intelligence by the end of his second term in 2001 the administration had cut 360 000 jobs from the federal payroll and the government was spending 44 percent more on contractors than it had in 1993
544647 outsourcing as a virtual joint venture between house majority leader newt gingrich and clinton
544648 boldest privatization agenda put forth by any president to date
544649 a neoconservative drive to siphon u s spending on defense national security and social programs to large corporations friendly to the bush administration
544650 every purchase you make with a credit card every magazine subscription you buy and medical prescription you fill every web site you visit and every e mail you send or receive every bank deposit you make every trip you book and every event you attend all these transactions and communications will go into what the defense department describes as a virtual centralized grand database
544651 so many former intelligence officers joined the private sector during the 1990s that by the turn of the century the institutional memory of the united states intelligence community now resides in the private sector thats pretty much where things stood on september 11 2001

544656 europeans love jazz very much but american audiences respond to the music in a really special way

544658 plays the tenor saxophone with long light flowing lines that build to tremendously forceful passages which despite their fierce energy and the power of his attack always remain completely controlled and smoothly executed
544659 respons vel pelo que sou n o porque fala bem de mim mas porque fala mal
544660 but its not yankee stadium i dont think theyre going to have as much success in that one as they did in this one
544661 i was like what the hells going on its not like i stunk it up last year its frustrating because i know i can still pitch i can still be productive out there but you know the days going to come im not going to officially ill just ride off into the sunset
544662 its kind of sad you know because its such a great offensive team here and you hate to see a team you grew up loving struggle like they are
544663 if you dont have pitching youre not going to win i dont care if you have an all star lineup which they do theyve got to find a solution when it comes to pitching if you dont get that solidified youre going to go down the drain quick
544664 that was the first time i saw it since i pitched it
544665 strange since it was the greatest thing that ever happened to me it was pretty cool i got goose bumps watching it
544666 the heroes from the offseason were travis thomas and john carlson
544667 they were like men amongst boys it was not even close for second but youll see some names pop up like i dont want to raise expectations too high but ill give you a for instance
544668 if you ask me to call out like one player ill call out a player like john ryan
544669 the christian worldview encompasses everything from philosophy to biology filmmaking to homemaking politics to poetry in order to truly understand the first thing about any aspect of our world we must see it in relation to gods sovereign plan for history the biblical worldview explains the universe as gods good but fallen creation redeemed by christ and thus imbues all of life with eternal significance
544670 i think anyone who doubts the quality of this horse is not being realistic he could be better than the big brown who came into the derby we think the racetrack will suit him perfectly and couldnt be happier with how hes doing
544671 hes shining hes happy i just cant see him doing anything but running his race but im still concerned about whats going to happen because i know the horse went into the belmont in very good condition
544672 whatever happened in that race i dont have an idea but if it happens again im going to know something is wrong with him so a whole lot depends on what happens in the haskell
544673 no chapter has all the joys finite life is a series of tradeoffs finding gods will and living for the glory of christ to the full in every chapter is what makes it a success

544678 i take an oath that no one knows about this poem tell me the truth from whom did you hear about it
544679 i take an oath by allah that i heard it from you last night when in a dream you had recited it to sayyidina rasulullah sallallahu alayhi wasallam whereupon sayyidina rasuluallah sallallahu alayhi wasallam became attentive towards you and because of its blessings allah taalaa granted you complete cure from your ailment
544680 hey dad i dont need anything for myself today but would you do something for my son he really needs your help
544681 the fate of a sweet and promising child depended on the willingness of a number of particular adults to do the bare minimum of what they were supposed to do
544682 had just one of them performed their duty or done their job danieal would be alive today
544683 the grand jury has no doubt that he never prepared these documents
544684 what i can tell you is the internal accountability was weak and the demand for external accountability from providers was equally weak
544685 when that happens there are a lot of risks in the system
544686 i dont want them to test the notes for the ink to see if they had been written earlier
544687 this is the case that is going to take the mayor down

544700 every race has the same coloring pigment in their skin it is called melanin the difference between the skin color of one person and another is primarily due to the amount of melanin present in their skin
544701 there are no clear and fixed demarcations of people fitting coherent sets of physical traits within any racial groups there are varying shades of pigmentation body shape hair texture facial structures etc as well as shared characteristics across racial divides
544702 a xenophobic person is aware of the fear and therefore has to believe at some level that the target is in fact a foreigner
544703 do you just have issues with choosing which one to wear every morning

544706 despite vowing to run an issue oriented campaign al franken is going on the attack again
544707 we feel that every minnesotan should know that while norm coleman was busy working to increase renewable fuel use and battle oil speculation
544708 in the world of football they have whats called the hail may pass a desperate attempt to get a failing team to get the ball down the field in the world of politics they have what they call the al franken campaign hell attack anything anywhere anytime the latest hes twisting the facts and attacking norm coleman for fishing whats next an attack on how norm parts his hair heres the real story norm coleman is an independent voice and thats according to the washington post norm is fighting for renewable energy cracking down on speculation and he voted to take tax incentives away from big oil companies and al franken when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states its good to stay busy al and next time you hear al franken go on the attack which he does often consider the source a campaign thats well a little desperate to move the ball
544709 im norm coleman candidate for u s senate and i approve this message

544720 ive lost a lot of weight im glad to say it took me a couple of months to get into shape for this film and it took me like a couple of weeks for it to all disappear im not joking i lost 90 percent of the weight really quickly
544721 i had to eat like a trojan to keep the weight on because youre doing 12 13 hour days and youre doing a lot of stunts during the day anyway and youre doing a lot of fighting during the day so its like a workout
544722 and then youve got your workout at night so i was just eating enough for like four people and then of course when i stopped doing all of that i stopped eating all of that i stopped going to the gym it dropped it just disappeared in weeks i was so disappointed
544723 those are critical field and unit command positions theres a level of experience that you get from having to make those decisions
544724 were thinking outside the box and doing some innovative things
544725 i assure you its only for jess to see its to show her that her fans are there for her were hoping that she would get a laugh out of it were just trying to cheer her up

544742 si la canci n estar en el disco y sin dudas ser un xito es britney con una voz interna y agresiva el tema ya est finalizado
544743 people who do the work in america will never be invisible to the democratic party
544744 they are working longer hours than ever even as they are asked to meet a new and growing set of caregiving responsibilities
544745 as we meet our country is in the sixth year of a two front war our economy is struggling our planet is in peril these challenges and many others demand new leadership
544746 senator clinton has worked to ensure that the democratic platform will represent the concerns of working families in america today the collaborative effort between clinton staff and the obama campaign has been positive and productive and we look forward to continuing to review the platform as it develops
544747 if you want to say invisible americans i think obama was supportive of issues for the invisible americans if you will from the beginning
544748 will not give up a single iota of its nuclear rights
544749 a clear signal for a mutual freeze we would freeze our sanctions efforts and iran the development of its centrifuges

544751 mel oliver come in cap youre crossing the bottom of a ship coming at you
544752 we just took his tow the barge is right in front of us and were running it over
544753 i would do each and every thing that i did again
544754 i would push resolution 125 which raised the tax for the first time in argentina since the advent of democracy we have seriously discussed a law that for the first time addressed redistribution of revenue
544755 this news conference is not enough to confirm any substantial changes in the government
544756 weve just been working together for a long time with the same ideas on how to improve argentina
544757 i think if we can resolve the problem between india and the united states i think well have an accord it can take a month two months but we need to sign an accord
544758 i said to president bush that its not possible for people to just lie on the beach after so much work after so much meeting and negotiation i think if the problem between india and the united states is resolved an agreement will be signed
544759 something abnormal happened in my opinion during the doha round we were so close to making an agreement and it didnt happen because of minor issues
544760 we have to guard against infodemics in which inaccurate false information is disseminated prompting social unrest that spreads like an epidemic
544761 the reality is that we lack the means to effectively deal with harmful internet messages
544762 the regulations violate the autonomy of the internet and are an effective tool for tighter media control by the government
544763 the regulations would bring about a reverse in the advancement of the internet media as a whole
544764 south korea is a leading testbed for the it industry and the internet media here certainly has a frontier like aspect in leading experimental democracy
544765 but the internet media should also serve public good and compared with other countries south korea has lacked the institutional control over the media in which people tend to expand and reproduce unverified one sided information
544766 if you want to sue me with the cyber defamation law go ahead history will charge you with insulting south koreans
544767 on a global scale i dont think you are going to get this kind of investment again
544768 our marketing campaign for china is the largest we have ever done in a single country
544769 we see this as a marketing platform that will help us to achieve market leadership in china this year
544770 but it is also par for the course part of doing business in this market
544771 our people are really excited to be here it is a win win
544772 we have selected employees who have demonstrated their passion and commitment to coke and the olympics
544773 i hear from clients that they are spending quite a huge amount on that
544774 this is a nice way to do something good with the event even after it is finished

544785 no pod a haber predicho que me iba a encontrar ahora escribiendo para esta revista en mi nuevo rol de editor le quiero agradecer a
544786 cuyas ideas en identidades federadas est n dando forma a la siguiente generaci n de tecnolog as de identidad de microsoft
544787 entre tu y yo existe una llama que arde en resplandor como el sol de la ma ana hazme ver que cerca est s y brotar mi coraz n de l grimas y en t tendr identidad
544788 but you dont have to pay tax on stuff you probably wouldnt have bought anyway
544789 el verdadero hombre inteligente es el que aparenta ser pendejo delante de un pendejo que aparenta ser inteligente
544790 no permitir que seas el palad n de ninguna dama noble
544791 pero mi se or todo caballero debe servir a una dama para demostrarle la pureza de su amor
544792 si est s tan ansioso de luchar por una dama te presentar a tres para que escojas
544793 si margaret te pareci demasiado vieja y fea entonces qu piensas de esta dama es de noble cuna y no puedes negar su hermosura
544794 este amor del que hablas es un amo dif cil de complacer
544795 mi se or es apenas una jovencita y mi media hermana
544796 y he sido lo bastante generoso como para presentarte a tres ahora debes decidir
544797 trato de mostrarte algo que aprend de mi maestro merl n
544798 y a pesar de sus votos de amar castamente la mayor a de las veces sienten pasi n por aquellas a quienes sirven no es verdad
544799 y cuanto m s grande es su pasi n por las damas mayor es su celo en servirles verdad
544800 piensa en la anciana en la ni a reci n nacida y en la jovencita que es tu hermana todas ellas son manifestaciones de lo femenino y en la medida en que esas formas cambian lo que llamas amor cambia con ellas cuando dices que est s enamorado lo que realmente est s diciendo es que has satisfecho una imagen que llevas dentro as es como comienza el apego con la inclinaci n por una imagen podr as afirmar que amas a una mujer pero si ella llegara a traicionarte con otro hombre tu amor se trocar a en odio por qu porque tu imagen interior ha sido mancillada y puesto que sa era la imagen que amabas el hecho de que haya sido traicionada te provoca ira
544801 mira m s all de tus emociones las cuales cambiar n constantemente y preg ntate qu hay detr s de la imagen las im genes son fantas as que existen para protegernos de algo que no deseamos enfrentar en este caso se trata del vac o a falta de amor por ti mismo creas una imagen para tapar el vac o de all el intenso dolor que causa un rechazo o una traici n en el amor porque deja expuesta la herida abierta de tu propia necesidad
544802 el amor es considerado como algo muy hermoso y elevado
544803 lo que suele considerarse amor puede tener consecuencias horribles pero se no es el final de la historia
544804 ustedes los mortales dicen amar cuando se sienten completamente atra dos por otra persona
544805 su fantas a es poseer a alguien completamente o bien ser totalmente pose dos pero los magos hablan de amor cuando se sienten totalmente libres de apego sin posesi n
544806 la indiferencia no tiene energ a ni vida el amor del mago es incre blemente vivo y fluye con la energ a del cosmos para que eso suceda debes ser como un recipiente vac o los mortales est n tan llenos de ego que no tienen espacio para nada m s el mago est completamente vac o por lo tanto el universo lo puede llenar de amor
544807 normalmente vives seguro tras los muros de tu propio ego te agrada la seguridad de tu refugio tu invulnerabilidad con el amor se resquebrajan los muros por lo menos temporalmente quedas expuesto y vulnerable tal como lo tem as pero la emoci n abrumadora del amor te hace vivir el xtasis y no una sensaci n dolorosa como pensabas en el mejor de los sentidos enamorarse significa compartir lo desconocido con otra alma estar dispuestos a marchar juntos hacia la sabidur a de lo desconocido
544808 se es un acto de amor el impulso del amor se forj en el coraz n de tu enemigo pero se convirti en odio al pasar por el filtro de la memoria las experiencias pasadas distorsionan el impulso del amor en el momento en que brota hacia la superficie pero lo que no debes olvidar es que toda expresi n podr a ser de amor si pudieras verla como es originalmente
544809 es posible construir un puente entre el tipo de amor que sentimos los mortales y el que sientes t
544810 no es necesario construir puente alguno puesto que el amor es uno solo
544811 traer esta decisi n felicidad y realizaci n tanto para m como para aquellos a quienes afectar
544812 ganar s el pan con el sudor de tu frente
544813 no me importa cu ntos competidores hay en este torneo

544817 with the liberal party youre dealing with not a question of personalities its policies
544818 what weve inherited from 12 years of mr costello as treasurer is the second highest interest rates in the developed world together with his being part and parcel of a government which was engaged in climate change denial and work choices
544819 so on that score ive got to say its quite clear cut to me that the liberals whoever their leader is have a real problem with their policy direction for the nations future because of the legacy they left us from the past
544820 given recent events weve stepped up our public education efforts
544821 kind of makes you wonder whats going on doesnt it
544822 if this all goes bad i think its going to all go bad for everybody
544823 it would have to be a moment in time a perfect storm coming together
544824 the concern was i didnt know what was going on and it comes down to the hassle factor
544825 if something were to happen thats going to be legal expenses to me because i dont know what to do

544846 these diseases occur predominantly in people of color living in the 13 mississippi delta and else where in the american south in disadvantaged urban areas and in the u s mexico border as well as in certain immigrant populations and disadvantaged white populations living in appalachia
544847 its an unintended form of racism in a sense we need to make these diseases household words

544851 by meditating you can become happier you can concentrate more effectively and you can change your brain in ways that support that
544852 when i try to meditate now it does have a more powerful effect
544853 meditating and mindfulness now help me get in touch with what really matters and stop worrying about surface stuff
544854 it helped me profoundly in handling all my grief around dads illness and death it helps me with almost everything
544855 id had a frenzied day having to think and concentrate hard speak and plan all day the train was a nightmare packed noisy no seats left and truly horrid i just found a place to sit in the floor closed my eyes and allowed all the mad busyness of my brain that day to stop concentrated on my breathing and it was a massive relief and escape
544856 of course it may be that particular kinds of people are drawn to meditate so more work is needed but a slightly thicker cortex has also been found in the brains of taxi drivers and jugglers who have to concentrate while staying calm
544857 but there is no evidence to suggest that meditation can help to prevent treat or cure your cancer or any other disease
544858 when you practice meditation you may see more clearly any anxiety depressed feelings or negative thoughts that you have this can make you feel frightened low or disorientated
544859 we need a lot more research in this area before we will know for sure how meditation can help people with cancer
544860 ive uh been in guant namo bay for two years
544861 tito lhar was there sa dressing room namin sabi niya pau intrebyuhin kita

544876 using a wide array of instruments like guitar harmonium melodica field recordings percussion computer harmonica zither piano accordion soprano sax and trumpet tapes music lives at the intersection of a 21st century chamber music and an imaginary folklore i write this on a train from weimar to berlin the distance to my girls at home is growing bigger and this always makes me feel a little melancholic riding through the marvellous green and sun flooded mark brandenburg countryside slowly passing by vast yellow rape fields and ancient abandoned factories the music on my headphones seems to fit almost too perfectly the sun and nature are certainly core ingredients of opera and its slowly floating melodies carry the spirit of travel not on an aircraft but submerged in a landscape instead

544907 i want mobile to interact with the world around me
544908 the mobile experience is one that is very personal the mobile experience is not about where youre going its about where youre headed its more of a contextual search
544909 for instance online im a hub in areas that i know
544910 the bar should know that i drink one type of drink more often than another type and should show that drink higher or larger on the screen
544911 there are real estate limitations on the screen of a mobile phone and thus it all comes down to efficient data management
544912 the mobile device becomes a remote control for the world around you
544913 everything these days has data with relevance to what youre doing here right now
544914 the mobile device then becomes your tricorder your universal device for interacting with your environment

544918 but when patted on the head by queen pomare and called her little favourite carried about on the backs of her attendants and every juvenile whim quickly humoured i forgot all the pretty little stories of the far off land and thought only of the present of the actual before and around me then there was no place like tahiti and i have a lingering fancy that in my childish vanity there was the thought that after all it was perhaps better to be bom a tahitian than an englishman

544993 voltaria a faz lo porque pela primeira vez desde o advento da democracia em 1983 as institui es se dispuseram a discutir seriamente com a possibilidade de ser sancionada uma lei que previa a redistribui o de renda
544994 ter instalado o debate sobre como distribuir a renda excepcional na argentina
544995 o problema da concentra o da riqueza em um mundo cada vez mais complicado em mat ria de alimentos e de energia vai exigir desta presidente e do que vier depois a o

544997 este um pa s exportador de alimentos com a modifica o dos termos do interc mbio comercial come a a press o sobre os pre os internos porque querem ter o maior excedente export vel poss vel
544998 certo grau de ingenuidade diante da rea o de setores muito poderosos amea ados em seus privil gios
544999 quando algu m v o filme completo todo o conflito observa que os que sa ram ganhando com a queda do projeto de taxa o foram os exportadores os setores mais concentrados da economia
545000 a argentina um lugar de investimentos por ser altamente competitiva
545001 o fato de termos vis es e processos diferentes n o significa que n o possamos articular projetos
545002 quero destacar a firme convic o de quem fala ela e do presidente lula de que a integra o importante na vis o dos dois pa ses
545003 o assunto em doha era o que colocavam os pa ses desenvolvidos nessa negocia o e o que os pa ses emergentes colocavam mas n o era um bom neg cio para os pa ses emergentes e especificamente para a rep blica argentina com um desenvolvimento industrial inferior diferente do que tem o brasil
545004 hoje por suas pol ticas constantes o brasil tem uma empresa como a embraer e n s n o temos nada por isso temos que aplicar medidas que sejam permanentes no tempo
545005 a import ncia da argentina como um pa s altamente competitivo
545006 recentemente o presidente da fiesp federa o das ind strias do estado de s o paulo paulo skaf disse numa entrevista a um jornal argentino que a argentina hoje muito mais competitiva que o brasil na hora de se investir
545007 e isso tamb m muito importante para a integra o
545008 e tamb m quero ressaltar a visita do presidente ch vez acho que a integra o da venezuela ao mercosul algo mais que importante especialmente num momento em que o mundo discute energia pre os e alimentos
545009 voltaria a fazer todas as coisas que fiz e tamb m diria que voltaria a aplicar a resolu o 125

545013 libraries aim for order a bookstore should be the paradigm of artful disorder
545014 thats not a good thing either way you look at it for me or his wife
545015 for a team with 30 million worth of cap room and ryans ability i thought we would be much further along
545016 hes still playing great it happens in every sport when someone sets the bar so high guys find a way of creeping up behind you
545017 i dont think theres a huge difference between a semifinal and a final but to win it would be huge
545018 im going to have to play against one of the best players in the world to win it i feel like im playing well enough to do it
545019 ive been making sure i get ice on it after every match it hurts sometimes after matches
545020 i came into the store because they were having a going out of business sale just like today
545021 if someone came through the door today with a big check id sell it to em just like john edwards did to me
545022 i got to thinking about the business and asked her what she thought
545023 she said she didnt know anything about hardware but i told her she could learn
545024 i decided about five weeks ago to start a going out of business sale
545025 but ive known for some time that i would have to give it up i just didnt have the time to devote to it
545026 if id been able to make til october the store would be 110 years old
545027 you could hardly buy a single spring for that these days not hardly a whole bed and couple chairs
545028 i found several leather collars and harnesses plow handles plow blades and all kinds of horse drawn items
545029 i even found an old coffin that hadnt been finished
545030 a hundred years ago the store had to be a lot more versatile
545031 the store was located in this building until 1993 and weve saved a few things from that original store to keep that history intact
545032 penn hardware has always been a great neighbor and this register will have a special place here the stores history will not be forgotten
545033 its just part of my daily routine to eat at bobs up the street and visit the local stores
545034 she was making the rounds in penn hardware and other stores when she was still in a stroller
545035 now they all know her and she knows all of them
545036 it doesnt take long to start thinking about all your regulars as more than just customers
545037 thats another part ill miss but theyll still be able to find me
545038 believe me lowes opening had nothing to do with my closing the store
545039 a lowes in mayodan hadnt even been thought about when i started thinking about closing up i was just doing it part time anyway and needed to find something else
545040 its another hardware store owner who might be interested in buying out all thats left
545041 hes welcome to it cause i dont want to keep opening every saturday to sell it piece by piece

545045 playing the race card from the bottom of the deck
545046 techniques adopted by system crackers when attempting to break into corporate or sensitive private networks
545047 the opportunity of being in the olympics is something so big it doesnt get any bigger than this
545048 it is an overwhelming feeling something i have to take with both hands and make the most of
545049 i would like to be a symbol to give other kids in the townships hope
545050 especially root for athletes from countries where just showing up in beijing is a miracle like the zimbabweans and hopefully the iraqis
545051 i would have never thought that i would be sitting here if someone could have said what do you think youll be doing in 2008
545052 as a matter of fact it just dawned on me that it was 40 years ago i was at training camp and i was going wow thats almost twice as old as michael phelps is now wow i swam a long time ago
545053 he is more experienced and in some ways more experienced than i was going in to doing it because he won six gold medals and i only won two the olympics before i won seven
545054 i would expect to see him win by margins and set times that have never been done before and hell be unbelievable thats what i suspect is going to happen
545055 that was gary hall as in gary hall sr not jr
545056 stakes were high for both of us i didnt want to have to censor myself around gary and i didnt want to wonder about what he was doing i told gary it was nothing personal and we could open the door after the race he said no problem and went about his business
545057 he was the biggest threat to mark in the 100 freestyle
545058 and mark was afraid of him for years later he was tormented by spitz

545062 my dad always used to give me and my sister advice like most kids we didnt always follow that advice
545063 a piece of advice he gave me once was never make athletes your heroes because they make mistakes too i guess i didnt follow that advice very well id like to introduce you to my hero my mentor my father emmitt thomas
545064 my late grandfather is still my hero i remember those long hot summer nights sitting on the porch listening to a game or a fight
545065 he taught me about honor commitment love religion and respect
545066 it happens when youre protecting someone like john elway and what happens is the night before the game you get little or no sleep
545067 because if you didnt do your job youll forever be known as the guy who lost our franchise i would also like to thank john it was worth every sleepless night
545068 we never approached this with the idea of breaking the bank and treating it as an unrestricted situation because it isnt
545069 deacon jones said i was gonna cry you bet im gonna cry

545081 its great bringing my movie to a place that i feel familiar
545082 not like the cannes film festival where nobodys speaking english or the tribeca film festival where no one sits down
545083 theres something poetic about coming back to the place where i used to come for holidays camping trips with my dad and stepmother and my very large family
545084 she has such an incredible heart and such a generous spirit
545085 she does so much out of the glare of the lights to make the world a better place
545086 there arent a lot of role models for us in the world or people we can look up to
545087 people who are not afraid to stick their neck out people who are not afraid to stand up for things and be unpopular to go against the grain think outside the box
545088 and we need and i need michael moore in my life

545100 at this point were going to review information obtained by the columbia police department from its visit out on the scene yesterday and try to take everything into account
545101 they want to get everything there straightened up and cleaned up

545109 in germany they first came for the communists and i didnt speak up because i wasnt a communist
545110 why would you want to put spray paint on a kids face
545111 we live in the same community we are all in this hellhole together
545112 if we see someone calling the police then we target them
545113 you are trying to stop me from what i live what i believe in and what i breathe we are not going to let no one get in the way
545114 take a deep breath back off and call law enforcement
545115 i said if you are going to write on the wall write on your own wall
545116 why would you want to put spray paint on a kids face
545117 we live in the same community we are all in this hellhole together
545118 its slowing down im starting to grasp the whole concept of the defense things have started going a little bit better
545119 its been a big jump youre playing with all pro guys guys that have been to the pro bowl super bowls experienced guys so its definitely a learning experience
545120 you have to respect guys like that guys with that level of talent who play like that and play at that high level all the time
545121 you have to respect it and learn from it thats what im trying to do just learn from what they do and just keep pushing forward
545122 we knew he had good ability he has a lot of toughness you wouldnt think that a guy from a small school like that would have and he enjoys playing the game and hell mix it up
545123 so thats the surprising thing that you know about him and we like about him i think hes a good young prospect and hes going to do pretty good
545124 he tells me to keep working hard he gives me tips on certain things but hes pretty much in my ear about certain things
545125 you want the truth no im not surprised because he can play
545126 with his size and his speed we knew that he would be somewhere he was determined to get on a roster and get into a camp hes going to be missed i need him this year
545127 im a rookie and like any other rookie ive got a lot to learn i definitely have a far way to go
545128 i really do understand that the overwhelming majority of fans wanted so badly for me to succeed
545129 additionally i would like to sincerely apologize to those fans offended by my wrongful actions last saturday night it was an overreaction on my part to what i felt was a series of public inaccurate and unfair remarks about me
545130 the most rational strategy for an individual parent would be not to vaccinate his child to protect against the slight chance of serious adverse reaction
545131 plastic does not degenerate and is difficult to recycle given worlds enough and time the planet will eventually be overrun by plastic
545132 there seems no way to get the pregnant woman loose without using the dynamite which will inevitably kill her
545133 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist
545134 and i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
545135 i dont care what group you identify with as long as you are ashamed of it
545136 although rav hirschs torah and his worldview are still relevant to portions of our community even today they have lost their relevance for some a new generation requires a new language to kindle in its heart the flame of torah that is barely flickering
545137 means the torahs conquest of life and not the torahs flight from life it means the torahs casting a light into the darkness rather than hiding from the darkness it means applying torah to the earth and not divorcing it from the earth
545138 rav mantels declaration which angered many in the community came at a sit down kiddush at dr
545139 a new generation requires a new language to kindle in its heart the flame of torah that is barely flickering
545140 although rav hirschs torah and his worldview are still relevant to portions of our community even today they have lost their relevance for some a new generation requires a new language to kindle in its heart the flame of torah that is barely flickering
545141 lastly in a torah world that increasingly opts for limitation restriction and a narrowing of creativity individuality and world view as the best way to avoid problems many of us sense that outside of israel this is not the best way to go
545142 we also fully believe that torah can and must illuminate every permissible nook and cranny of the planet that there is a way to be a torah attorney a torah carpenter a torah journalist a torah politician these are not bedieveds but for the right people lechatchilas
545143 rabbi mantel made a point that even those of us who are profoundly attracted to rav hirsch should keep ever in mind the hirschian ideal is not easy
545144 more seriously i cant speak for the needs of israeli torah society since i live here and dont know those needs from the inside i am aware of how difficult the constriction is for a substantial minority within their ranks but it is not my place to suggest that the torah accomplishment that has been achieved for the majority should be sacrificed
545145 all those i know who have studied rsrh seriously are struck by how much more relevant his thought is today than when he committed it to paper a century and a half ago
545146 more seriously i cant speak for the needs of israeli torah society since i live here and dont know those needs from the inside israeli haredi society in particular is more monolithic and has an authority system that seemingly is subscribed to by all those who chose to remain within it gedolei roshei yeshiva in bnei brak and yerushalayim have the right to call the shots about torah life within their communities they seem to have very very little need for the vision of rsrh i am aware of how difficult the constriction is for a substantial minority within their ranks but it is not my place to suggest that the torah accomplishment that has been achieved for the majority should be sacrificed so i will stick to safer ground and speak about a community about which i know a little more

545150 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
545151 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
545152 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
545153 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
545154 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
545155 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
545156 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
545157 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
545158 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
545159 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
545160 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
545161 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
545162 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
545163 hey how are you doing how are your family hows work whats new here and there
545164 hold up aint you supposed to be on my side
545165 but thats the thing its not about making it in the industry thats where youre missing the point
545166 it was on the last page of the 1st section in todays paper version and a search online turned it up there too notice the reporter doesnt say who turned off the lights cameras and mikes for all times readers would know it was some kind of natural phenomenon
545167 cyberspace a consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators in every nation by children being taught mathematical concepts
545168 does this make sense is it benefiting others and myself would i want to be treated this way

545194 until the last few days the level of care was no different than that of any patient on a medical ward with the exception of a ventilator and essentially unchanged for the last number of months since his admission
545195 physicians have the authority to make medical decisions to withhold or withdraw life sustaining treatment from a patient without the consent of the patient or the patients family
545196 we want to make sure that clinical decisions are left to physicians and not judges
545197 the arguement of conserving resources is not valid from a halachic point of view
545198 one is not neccessarily obliged to provide or recieve treatment if it causes pain discomfort and will not provide long term prolongation of life defintion of long term varies by posek on the other hand if the patient requests it then it should be provided
545199 in israel where we actually have to set up a medical system that works and maximizes care for the entire population as opposed to the usa where individual doctors need to make decisions based solely on the patient that is in front of them
545200 perhaps dr hall can elucidate further on rav tendlers position
545201 i am not sure if other poskim have addressed this specific issue having an a priori policy in place that provides universal but in some cases limited coverage as opposed to maximally treating patients as they present knowing that those at the end of the line will recieve little to no treatment
545202 a patient who has a prognosis for cure takes precedence in the distribution of limited medical resources over a patient whose prognosis is only for temporary control of his disease this applies only when the patient with the poorer prognosis is passively neglected in favor of the patient with the better prognosis however active intervention with the less fortunate patient i e to terminate his therapy so that the patient with the better prognosis may utilize those resources is forbidden

545224 what sort of special praise can other nations offer that we jews cannot
545225 missiles can fail and work accidents can happen and if we are deserving they will
545226 what sort of special praise can other nations offer that we jews cannot
545227 unfortunately they are unable to relate to the secular world
545228 teachings are superficial addressing issues from an archaic non scientific pseudo psychological perspective
545229 fails to acknowledge that halacha has had a variety of interpretations across different times and cultures
545230 running into those who have remained orthodox unrecognizable from only a few years earlier is an uncanny experience they often work for outreach organizations and are as unsettling to me as evangelical christians
545231 everyone has heard your soul is a diamond that should be kept in a special case a hundred times metaphors like those sound wonderful and make superficial sense but falter in the face of hormonal reality
545232 the orthodox world they present bears not a trace of dissatisfaction never did i ever hear a speaker or trip leader discuss any problems within the orthodox world apparently as long as they follow proper halacha everybody is happy and fulfilled with neither depression nor repression money nor domestic problems
545233 well yes theres just as much of the schmutz that plagues general society in the frum world except we dont talk about it
545234 having said that they are still selling a product and as a result they will present the positives and omit the negatives
545235 dont confuse jews with judaism and dont confuse rabbis with torah
545236 with a few minor differences here and there is the same the world over
545237 were confounded because every man heard jesus followers who were galileans speak in his own language
545238 this new strategy is illustrated by several recent media articles the washington post ran a news article on june 21 picked up from the associated press about messianic jews who claim that they are discriminated against in israel a questionable accusation
545239 1 it is a distortion to claim that one can be a jew and at the same time believe in jesus as a god or as a messiah or a prophet or savior

545247 i heard from the gaon and tzaddik rabbi michoel ber weissmandl zt
545248 does he take into account the points that ori makes that german jews were wealthier and more skilled and therefore could get out or maybe german jews were closer to what was going on and therefore more informed as to the real threat
545249 while the jewish people should no doubt be constantly undergoing cheshbon hanefesh and recognizing our weaknesses to claim that we know the ways of divine justice and we can explain why things happen the way they do is far beyond our capacities
545250 sensitive and legal topics important to every individual on financials and government issues
545251 why should i act any better the goyim will hate us anyway
545252 job skills had nothing to do with immigration visas in the 1940s
545253 are there today other possible factors where unchecked migration immigration could run counter to our security interests
545254 1 do you regard reports of radical muslims sneaking in across our southern border to be false all things being equal wouldnt they pick the most porous border to cross
545255 2 do you believe that the immigrants entering illegally from mexico plan to learn english as earlier waves of legal non english speaking immigrants typically did it appears that prominent organizations backing the illegals would be quite happy if the illegals received government benefits but never integrated themselves into our society
545256 if i did not know that you were fine upstanding bnei torah i would throw you out of my home you sound to me like maskilim whose only concern is mastery of the subject matter what about instilling in our children ahavas torah character refinement and yiras shomayim the problem today is that children do not experience the sweetness of torah
545257 there are no neighborhoods that are primarily chareidi not even many blocks or even apartment buildings everywhere a jewish child looks he sees the larger non jewish society yet this too has a positive side
545258 there is a growing divide within orthodoxy and the one size fits all shul and school is becoming extinct
545259 in some situations the price to pay as part of the deal is much heavier than the price of losing the captive soldier

545267 and yet there are any number of orthodox jews who say that homosexuals and transsexuals are simply mentally disturbed and need to be

545269 today many doctors again claim their scientific knowledge imbues them with some special insight into which life is worthy of preservation the doctors in winnipeg canada who sought to disconnect samuel golubchuk an elderly religious jew from his ventilator and feeding tube asserted that the decision was theirs alone regardless of golubchuks wishes and the canadian medical association fully supported that claim
545270 my work of trying to fix things my way as i thought they must be

545272 evolutionists deny any difference in kind between human beings and other species

545277 advocates of the schools strict exclusionary policy cited the bts secular relatives expressing the fear that even second hand encounters with non religious people could do irremediable damage to the spiritual health of tender impressionable haredi children bt children had to be kept out of mainstream haredi schools because the newly observant tend to meet with their non religious rela tives and the children are exposed to their relatives culture their speech patterns music body language and concepts the haredi community has enough troubles with its own young people without importing trouble from outside
545278 it is easier to avoid difficult choices concerning secular dress speech mores styles and aspirations by putting distance between us and them this is a perfectly legitimate expression of devotion to hkbh but it is not the only one
545279 i am wary of questioning the decision of a parent not to allow her child to associate with a particular individual
545280 and if the parent was wrong well she erred on the side of caution no problem with that to my mind many parents dont allow their kids to use the library even if it ostensibly kosher and clean isnt it a shame that the child is deprived from all the educational material guess what the parent knows that too she weighed the pros and cons and made a decision an informed decision
545281 i am cheered by the school some of my grandchildren attend in dallas which welcomes not yet frum kids and does not make their mothers sign a tzniyus agreement all in consultation with a major american rosh yeshiva
545282 i hope my ffb grandchildren dont turn out like that
545283 the unvarnished reality is that baalei teshuvah will be met with resistance and distance in communities under the sway of one hashkafah but met with a much warmer reception in areas in the spheres of influence of different roshei yeshiva for many of us this means finding the baalei teshuvah who are being shunned and hurt and redirecting them physically and intellectually to safer havens where they will be warmly received
545284 i am cheered by the school some of my grandchildren attend in dallas which welcomes not yet frum kids and does not make their mothers sign a tzniyus agreement all in consultation with a major american rosh yeshiva
545285 chazal had something similar in mind when they observe that the book of rus offered us nothing new but was needed to inject some new vistas of chesed into the community
545286 if the latter approach is correct we would view the return to our community of tens of thousands of souls very differently than the interviewee in mishpacha
545287 we recognize the challenge of melding two communities together but we run to embrace the challenge rather than flee from its problems

545290 the eekar btw is not that we must stop building the externals once the internal needs become obvious but put in at least as much effort in revamping the internal
545291 we need to recognize that some things simply cannot be fenced out some things are inherently us to do so we would have to fence ourselves out of where we are a logical impossibility yet some attempt this
545292 any decent bais yaakov graduate who wants to earn a somewhat decent living can go out of town and teach at a shalom torah academy school or one of their spawns

545294 anybody who reads the nineteen letters will find that until now he did not know judaism as he knows it now and literally becomes a new being
545295 has not been practical life to understand the world and our duty in it
545296 to reestablish peace and harmony on earth and to bring the glory of g d back to earth
545297 is proclaimed on every page of the word of g d as the result and aim of torah
545298 our goal that every jew and jewess though the example they provide in their own lives should be priests of g d and genuine humanity
545299 the letter of the law is preserved but from which the spirit has fled
545300 do people who are modern orthodox by definition lack intense fear of heaven
545301 it is often pointed out by the mainstream yeshiva world that the last 150 years of german orthodox life produced no more than two or three talmudists or poskim legal decisors of the first rank compared to hundreds in eastern europe
545302 do people who are modern orthodox by definition lack intense fear of heaven
545303 do people who are modern orthodox by definition lack intense fear of heaven
545304 on the other hand events in baltimore always start on time thanks to the german influence on this community
545305 in a ccertain way these former germans brought their extreme anti reform and opposition to any compromise and became more litvish than the litvaks maybe part of todays extremism is the result of this cutural blend
545306 it is true that only hashem can be choker kloyos vlev but that doesnt preclude one from applying certain criteria to differentiate between an apparent chared el dvar hashem and someone who doesnt appear to be so

545328 the fish and wildlife service determined that the cabinet yaak grizzly population was low enough to warrant reclassification from threatened to endangered in 1993 and reaffirmed its finding in 1999
545329 we are very pleased that the court stopped the helicopter logging in grizzly bear habitat

545353 the viking lr experiment detected living microorganisms in the soil of mars
545354 more recent findings suggesting that the viking gcms would have missed such molecules if present necessitates a re evaluation of the viking lr data as well as a continued search for organic material and life at the martian surface

545356 we felt like there was not enough money to go around and some markets were lacking the necessary players to compete with this change we will allow every team to draft their roster for this year after this year we will go back to the original format of signing trading free agents etc

545362 dont establish any criteria for whose computer can be searched
545363 plenary authority to conduct routine searches and seizures at the border without probable cause or a warrant
545364 the most dangerous contraband is often contained in laptop computers or other electronic devices
545365 as a practical matter travelers only go to secondary for a more thorough examination when there is some level of suspicion
545366 yet legislation locking in a particular standard for searches would have a dangerous chilling effect as officers often split second assessments are second guessed

545373 fine i will try it if you leave me alone
545374 but if i am standing in a field in the countryside i notice everything i stopped and looked at the field and i noticed these things there are 19 cows in the field 15 of which are black and white and 4 of which are brown and white there is a village in the distance which has 31 visible houses and a church with a square tower and not a spire there are ridges in the field which means that in medieal times it was what is called a ridge and furrow field and people who lived in the village would have a ridge each to do farming on there is an old plastic bag from asda on the hedge and a squashed coca cola can with a snail on it and a long piece of orange string and there were 31 more things in this list of things i notice and if someone asked me afterward what the cows looked like i could ask which one and i could do a drawing of them at home and say that a particular cow had patterns on it like this
545375 how many times would they pack and unpack the suitcase and not notice me
545376 at first i would just lay flat laugh and ask myself how moronic can this family be

545403 you are looking at a man who has a lot of blemishes abrasions and scars dealt to him by lifes highs and lows
545404 but you are looking also at a man who stood tall in the arena who never quit even though it looked like the game was over on many many occasions the last 43 years of my life in the nfl has taught me that hard work determination the willingness to help someone else to a better life all of gods children have the chance to rise from the most modest circumstances to become a hall of famer just like this old undrafted free agent country boy from angleton texas
545405 he taught me about honor love hard work and respect
545406 growing up i was resentful and angry at other families around us because they seemed to be fully intact i would often lay awake at night and wonder why our family had to be different

545411 i did play the game with passion i did play the game with respect and i played it with a lot of heart
545412 all i ever wanted to do was coach in the nfl your dream is to always coach at the highest level to coach the no 1 draft pick

545416 nos recuerda constantemente que toda esa obsesiva y subversiva corriente de cine de saldo y subcultura de derribo y su extra a mezcla de belleza y miseria discurre simultanea a lo cotidiano

545426 its a clich term but it is like losing a family member
545427 youre not necessarily going to be able to go out and get
545428 it goes beyond just putting people on a slate of candidates
545429 most companies who are really good at this have a bias toward transparency
545430 that conversation doesnt cost you anything to have and it could help in terms of retention and engagement
545431 at this point you certainly figure into our long term plans as a key contributor but not necessarily as the next ceo or vp of sales
545432 however if you want to prepare for that position here are the kinds of things we think you would need
545433 if you want to lock them into the company then develop some retention plans that will lock them in
545434 you do have to tell people that this does not mean you can stop working
545435 you still have to perform fit the culture youve still to do a good job where you are
545436 we also need to say here are the things were going to do that will give you the opportunity to move up but the opportunity to move up and the guarantee that its going to happen are two different things
545437 succession does not have to be an adversarial process where theres only one winner
545438 short term cost cuts often end up hurting long term sustainability of profits and competitiveness and morale and employee loyalty suffers
545439 managing talent in this very different business environment is a challenge
545440 creating emotional connections to employees is what truly matters because this is where organizations can dramatically boost employee productivity and business outcomes
545441 share insights across the organization so everyone knows how to create superior customer value
545442 view the recession as an unparalleled opportunity not as a problem
545443 quasi experiment its a single shot pretest posttest design with no control group that means any conclusions about the effect raise an immediate question compared to what
545444 the reason most people are so miserable is that they cant stand themselves
545445 the wild world is becoming so remote to children that they miss out
545446 and an interest in the natural world doesnt grow as it should nobody is going protect the natural world unless they understand it
545447 reinforce the idea that many children dont spend enough time playing in the green outdoors and enjoying wildlife something older generations might have taken for granted
545448 play is the primary mechanism through which children engage and connect with the world and natural environments are particularly attractive inspiring and satisfying for kids something magical occurs when children and wild spaces mix
545449 i dont want to talk about it but i have definitely experienced abuse in a way that i would tell people to take their heart and run
545450 it doesnt matter how he hurts you with his hands or with his words you dont deserve it it aint worth it take your heart and run
545451 many of those who are coming have told their work or families that they are going on vacation
545452 theyre afraid of saying theyre taking part in an aids conference
545453 i contracted aids after having unprotected sex the guy didnt tell me he had hiv i fell in love him so i didnt use a condom

545457 i didnt suffer too much from discrimination its different in europe
545458 but in latin america its always very hard due to the culture and the catholic church
545459 everything is shameful here its shameful to be a homosexual a prostitute to have aids
545460 the first objective is in the context of the framework convention on climate change to determine the factors of emissions in order to carry out an inventory of greenhouse gases released by the sector
545461 the countries of the developing south according to the convention must adopt measures but are not obligated like the industrialised countries to reduce their emissions that is why we want to know for the countries like new zealand that do have an obligation how much they emit and how they are going to cut emissions

545506 just after the royal wedding wasnt it i remember your mum had the nice mugs with them on yer dad wouldne drink out of it cos he only liked his tea in a cup

545510 it doesnt seem that long ago but twenty five years go by awful fast when youre not paying attention exercise off gibraltar exotic it was compared with being here in march like i said we all thought we were off home then some clever clogs in engineering told us we were off near argentina where won the 78 world cup someone said off to some piddling islands miles from anywhere
545511 i was off duty in my bunk when the missile hit us a big noise something that didne belong smoke poured in and we were running we knew it an exocet first it looked ok the hole was above the water and it hadne gone off then they brought up the three who were burned an we started to chuck stuff overboard for the fire risk torpedoes depth charges all went overboard smithy said to me i hope these hit some argie sub but we knew it was just a waste an after five hours we were told to get off we stopped what we were doing except smithy he just kept going down for more crates and tipping them out and they can just put these up their hatches an all he gave these rockets a massive great throw and shouted something indecent spun round mad like i looked away from him into the sun and all i could see for a minute was the imprint of his soot blackened face and red eyes burned into my view then he was throwing up over the side crying hed not been able to get his best mate out of the smoke in time i took is arm and we both got over the line to hms arrow just two minutes i shouldve been where the missile hit but i was late id been sleeping id let them get us and it got them three others instead
545512 coming back was the worst all these people waiting for us the sheffield heroes we just felt like wed had our teeth kicked in and spat on wed lost our ship one of our crew

545514 the scientific community is really going to run with this

545516 i think id like something different jimmy how bout something chocolate maybe with a little baileys
545517 i got a new bottle of godivas just today one irish lady coming right up guy

545519 noir this is black black noir you know what to do
545520 oh forgive me for not introducing myself mr noir im emma black
545521 call me emma my cousin eloise told me that you might be able to help me you helped her out a while back remember
545522 oh yes how is her research going now that the simulacrum has been dealt with
545523 she says its going well and asked me to express her thanks to you
545524 i have a similarly odd problem im an antarctic ornithologist i study petrels skua and penguins in particular mmm this drink is fantastic
545525 yes yes antarctic ornithology sounds fascinating so whats whats the problem
545526 id ummm rather not talk about it here could you come by my place tomorrow
545527 yes thank you guy ill see you in the morning
545528 im sorry guy i was trying to figure the best way to explain whats going on
545529 as i told you last night im an antarctic ornithologist
545530 on my most recent trip down there i set up camp near a colony of macaroni penguins to study mating habits i was there alone for the first five weeks my one assistant for the season would arrive then
545531 the first few days i was busy setting up camp and acclimating the colony to my presence then it was time to get down to serious business i easily determined the leader of the colony and concentrated on him
545532 and he seemed to be taking as much interest in me as i was in him that was when
545533 that was when he started talking to me and asking questions
545534 before you get up and walk out please watch this
545535 as you can see he was quite interested in human civilization and what were doing to the planet i wondered if maybe i was going crazy and waited anxiously for my assistant to arrive in the meantime though i began at his request teaching him to read there was a rock outcropping nearby and i used the natural slate as a chalk board for our lessons
545536 by the time sherri arrived clarence i couldnt pronounce his real name but thats a close approximation was reading on a high school level i couldnt believe how smart he was and couldnt wait to see the look on sherris face when i showed her
545537 let me guess when your assistant arrived he stopped talking
545538 yes he continued to hang around the camp and when sherri was otherwise engaged he would whisper questions to me but if she was in earshot silence
545539 i want you to go down there with me i dont know what good it will do but you were so helpful to eloise not to mention not saying anything to anyone else about what happened in her lab that im just sure youll be able to help me
545540 sort of i couldnt understand most of it but i certainly got the intent
545541 he wants me to join him join with him i mean i think i dont know what to think
545542 clarence says that its part of the ritual im to eat all of these before he comes to take me to the actual ceremony
545543 since you are not comfortable with eating the sacramental fish raw your attendant will be allowed to cook it
545544 we shall be stronger and more complete with her joining to our society do not worry as she is happy now
545545 people have preconceived ideas of me they can be so negative creative people can be allowed to make mistakes
545546 she really said it if someone had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
545547 what crimes the crimes you seem suspiciously complicit in my dear nancy hm i think its time i did a cindy sheehan bumper sticker
545548 then he said he had to look at a lot of samples that the fbi had prepared to duplicate the letter material
545549 n or should we ignore the possibility that a us biologist may become disgruntled or turn rogue while working in one of these labs
545550 the fbi must not let the death of bruce ivins deter it from completing a full and thorough investigation of the attacks
545551 the chance to prove ivins guilt before a court of law has been lost but the need for a thorough investigation and a full accounting to the american people remains
545552 it appears increasingly likely that the only significant bioterrorism attack in history may have originated from right within the biodefense program of our own country
545553 i told you so you see how this will turn out
545554 by its very definition grace as it is worked out in our salvation is in direct opposition to all works and worthiness we discover from this that those who seek to join grace and works together are terribly deceived they may make high claims concerning their own holiness of life however it is clear from the word of god and from the very nature of grace that they are on a road that will certainly lead to the everlasting ruin of their souls perhaps grace will prevent this that very grace of which they have such false and corrupt ideas divine grace disdains the assistance of men and womens poor and imperfect efforts in the work of salvation this is the exclusive right of grace alone any attempt to complete what grace begins betrays our pride offends the lord and cannot be for our spiritual advantage never forget that grace is either absolutely free or it is not grace at all never forget that anyone who professes to be saved by grace must believe in his heart that he is saved entirely by that grace if he does not then he is being inconsistent in matters of the greatest importance

545585 ok we just did something different so were back on track
545586 the fact is sometimes its hard to walk in a single womans shoes thats why we need really special ones every now and then to make the walk a little more fun
545587 and forgive us our trash baskets as we forgive those who put trash in our baskets
545588 lord if you cant make me a better boy dont worry about it im having a real good time like i am

545592 its not enough for educators to be against nclb weve got to be for something else
545593 its not enough for educators to be against nclb weve got to be for something else
545594 someone told me they didnt want to learn one more new thing they didnt like new things
545595 if you put a good person in a corrupt system the system will win every time
545596 is it fair for us to introduce this will this put people on overload can people take one more thing
545597 lets make sure that in our frustrated moments we remember to look at the structures that prevent innovation rather than allowing ourselves to get frustrated by the good people in our schools who are working as well as they can within a very flawed system
545598 if you put a good person in a corrupt system the system will win every time
545599 they just need to know the causes themselves and thats all they need for the exam
545600 perhaps the issue of empowerment might hold more sway im thinking aloud here but i wonder what impact permitting teachers to decide curriculum goals and accountability standards might have
545601 its not enough for educators to be against nclb weve got to be for something else
545602 allows each school district to come up with its own methods to meet the states standards for writing reading math science and social studies history
545603 there will be no state tests in nebraska as long as i am state superintendent
545604 which would you rather use to get to know a child
545605 what students are to know and be able to do
545606 it is better to be good than to look good
545607 its not enough for educators to be against nclb weve got to be for something else
545608 because of our expertise in optimizing algae growth in a photo bioreactor pbr and the extraction of biomass and oil out of the pbr they came to us
545609 at this point in time we are negotiating with the worlds largest cruise liner to build an algae growing and oil extraction system on a cruise ship
545610 the emitted carbon dioxide will be intercepted and together with the biological waste of the ship will be used within the algae to oil system the oil will be extracted on board the ship and can be used after refining directly in the diesel engines
545611 the only thing new in the world is the history you dont know
545612 we sometimes we use the word depression because a recession connotes really just an inventory adjustment etc what were talking about doesnt have to be as bad as the great depression but its a major long term readjustment of the economy
545613 the articles intent was to focus on the largest capitalized companies that had have substantial exposure to the cds market
545614 however it is interesting to note that the majority of the big cap companies that have cds exposure are rated very aggressive by our rating model i doubt this is merely a coincidence rather it is an indication that many of these companies are taking substantial and often undisclosed risk of course not all the companies listed are using cds in a speculative manner unfortunately the lack of detailed disclosure of their positions does not allow me to make that judgment
545615 exposure to derivatives including cds is not one of the specific metrics utilized but their exposure is captured in part in the interest expense and interest income metrics used in the agr analysis
545616 growth is expected to continue to slow this year but will remain higher than most other economies in the world
545617 there will be deceleration this year coming from industry and high interest rates
545618 industrial impulses will be curtailed however there will be a partial offsetting if agriculture and monsoons will be good
545619 chinas manufacturing sector slowed last month for the first time since january as export orders and domestic investment both weakened
545620 the bursting of the housing bubble would be a dominant theme for investing in financial stocks in the next decade
545621 bear stearns was not the sacrificial lamb to the market gods and avoiding that meltdown doesnt mean things are getting better yet that is how financial stocks and the market have acted since
545622 the rating agency placed an additional 254 aaa rated alt a classes on negative ratings watch wednesday
545623 the folks who say the us housing market will stabilize anytime soon must be smoking some really strong stuff
545624 its not enough for educators to be against nclb weve got to be for something else
545625 its not enough for educators to be against nclb weve got to be for something else

545654 it can be very complicated to decide if any given symptom is directly related to the drug
545655 its early in camp and theres a lot of work to get done
545656 this is a valuable time for us this is not just finding out whos number one its about trying to find who gives us the very best chance to win
545657 we went live with the threes to get some contact with one another which is typically what we do at the end of the first week
545658 everybody would love to go live all of them when you yell out threes most of your twos and your ones say let us go they get excited about it
545659 you dont have time to think and thats a good thing
545660 i wasnt expecting it and sometimes thats good it was good to get back out there because its been a year for me since ive done it
545661 it feels good just to get that nervousness out of your system knock some of that rust off and get your tackling form back
545662 when you get an opportunity to go out there with your teammates and perform its always a good time i just wished we would have put one in the end zone
545663 it was good for some of us rookies and young bucks to go out there and go hard
545664 it was a great opportunity for all of us it was fun
545665 he said youre a heck of a guy but he wants you to keep your head in the game
545666 it looks like they have a lot more poise than they had last year
545667 ive been a fan since 65 ive been through a lot with the 49ers im watching them close up i know they have isaac bruce this year and im looking forward to seeing what he brings to the team lawson its good to see him healthy manny looks like manny
545668 we had a good practice this morning well be out this afternoon with special teams practice at the end you may have noticed we went live with the threes to get some contact with one another which is typically what we do at the end of the first week with our guys in particular since we dont have a scrimmage this year which is never live to the ground it gave us a chance to look at that they got about a dozen plays so that was good the reason that shaun hill worked with those groups because obviously today was his day to be in that role as far as taking less reps so we allowed him to take those plays within that three within that 12 play live we waived injured jeb terry he had a foot injury the other day hell be out for a little while so we could sign a player john booker is who we signed from san jose state who was with us before we let go about a month or so ago
545669 i have to look at the film i really do its hard for me ive watched so many different things it was not fair for me to say matter of fact every now and then i look up to see who did throw a ball and theyre already over talking to the coordinator mike martz and im not sure which one it was because they turned again i cant say
545670 well were going to continue each day i can give you what happened today but i cant give you whatll happen tomorrow what happened today was shaun hill and j t osullivan worked today or excuse me and alex smith and osullivan and this afternoon it will be special teams so they wont be going
545671 with the group theyre with yeah now as youve noticed i would assume they all practice up until they get to the team drills and in between they all practice so its just a matter of the scripted drills we give those scripted reps we give those to a particular player but they do practice you know they dont stand around
545672 usually we have none this year as ive said we have more reps in practice we also have more practices which allows me some flexibility in our schedule to make some adjustments as we go along which ive already done once so thats why
545673 no but i do know that it will be a short yardage goal line type of day so theres going to be a lot of run emphasis tomorrow that might or may not enter into our equation of thinking although what a quarterback does in those offenses is important its a little different its not quite as much pass
545674 everybody would love to go live all of them so when you yell out threes most of your twos and your ones say ahhh let us go let us go so they get excited about it
545675 i really dont know the ball went down the field it didnt get in the end zone but again i stopped it it got down to field goal range
545676 i hope not because that would mean something has probably happened to zak keasey and moran norris as far as injury goes because both of them are good football players but they are competing against a decent group of tight ends as well delanie walker vernon davis and billy bajema as well as the two new guys we got theres some good competition going there but i would think it would take something we dont want to occur for us to probably be without a fullback meaning injuries
545677 im not there yet im open to all three right now and thats where my mindset is as were all anxious to get to one i am and then again im not its early in camp and as i said the other day theres a lot of work to get done i want to know if we do have to go to another if we get to a second quarterback or a third something like that what is he capable of doing so this is a valuable time for us this is not just trying to find out whos no one this is also trying to find out who gives us a chance our very best chance to win
545678 im holding to that i said there was no time scheduled on this thing
545679 no its good that would be good thatd be alright
545680 well see guys i have no timetable because if i change it on you im not holding back information from you i just dont have it for you
545681 well with the progress that they make and with the maturity that they have theres a lot of things guys do get better during training camp as they become more familiar with things so stay on that if one guy stood out and shined far above the others then we would be pretty close to a decision but as it is its still fairly tight
545682 well cross that bridge when we get there you want one guy to take you there thats what youd like and we are going to do everything we can to win games whatever that means i want them all to be prepared and leave it at that
545683 i did not study them ive been around enough of them we had a lot of them at baltimore weve had them at every place ive been other than when we had john elway it was pretty much set in denver i cant remember who the guy was but otherwise the giants redskins you go back through it theyve all had them and theyre all different i think its educational watching what somebody else does but theyre different theyre not the same with the type of quarterback you are dealing with what you want your team to look like and who gives you the best chance to win there is a number of things to look at not just who throws the best the other situations that do occur are educational and they are helpful at times but i wish there was one out there i could say boy that one is just like ours but no two players are alike
545684 based on last year our special teams were pretty darn good i thought our defense was good but our special teams statistically were very high in a lot of categories it shows good depth on your football team but it doesnt say much about the starters it does defensively because i thought we were pretty good on defense like i said i point to the special teams first and then i look at the defense
545685 music is very important to white people it truly is the soundtrack to their lives meaning that white people are constantly thinking about what songs would be on the soundtrack for the biopic the problem is that most of the music that white people like isnt really dance friendly more often the songs are about pain or love or breaking up with someone or not being able to date someone or death so when white people go to concerts at smaller venues what to do they do they stand still this is an important part of white concert going as it enables you to focus on the music and it will prevent drawing excess attention to you remember at a concert everyone is watching you just waiting for you to try to start dancing then they will make fun of you the result is belle and sebastian concerts that essentially looks more like a disorganized line of people than a music event if you find yourself invited to a concert with a white person do not expect to dance prepare yourself for three hours of standing reasonably still it is also advised to get a beer or if legal a cigarette so you have something to do with your hands although it is acceptable to occasionally raise one hand and point just above the stage note the addition of the drug ecstasy changes everything
545686 sou incapaz de descobrir em mim mesmo esse sentimento oce nico
545687 those ads really were focused on two things they were focused on the fact that sen obama wants to raise taxes and im opposed of it and he opposes an energy policy which would work including offshore drilling so the message there is therere stark differences between myself and sen obama

545703 im im sorry for calling you a piggy but when you got a combo meal i was very happy i i wanted to see you eat normally and not this i have to starve myself normal

545707 what am i going to do with you and those samurai movies
545708 my dear yomi the basic groups that are necessary in life are action horror and comedy
545709 how are adults supposed to be if children are told to grow up
545710 if were told to grow up when were kids and to become adults what are we supposed to do when we become adults
545711 well the definition of being an adult is to be wise and mature just because someone turns 20 and by law youre an adult doesnt really mean youre one
545712 hotaka san is your first boyfriend unless youve been hiding someone else
545713 what i mean is dont push yourself into an age thing take things with a comfortable pace just go along with the ride of life but do know the rewards and consequences of your actions

545716 there was a guy about 130 or 150 years ago who had several losses before he won
545717 i cant quite remember his name but he went on to become the president of the united states his first name was abraham what was his last name again
545718 this is part of a systemic problem of the administration and i said im not going to take it anymore
545719 the disdain and uncooperative nature that this administration has shown toward congress is so egregious that i can no longer assume that it is simply bureaucratic incompetence or isolated mistakes rather i have come to the sad conclusion that this administration has intentionally obstructed congress rightful and constitutional duties
545720 then he said he had to look at a lot of samples that the fbi had prepared to duplicate the letter material
545721 n or should we ignore the possibility that a us biologist may become disgruntled or turn rogue while working in one of these labs
545722 the fbi must not let the death of bruce ivins deter it from completing a full and thorough investigation of the attacks
545723 the chance to prove ivins guilt before a court of law has been lost but the need for a thorough investigation and a full accounting to the american people remains
545724 it appears increasingly likely that the only significant bioterrorism attack in history may have originated from right within the biodefense program of our own country
545725 is this what we want in our pristine valleys of clayoquot sound
545726 i would say no i would absolutely say no so i think we have to oppose all of these projects

545728 give us a chance to do what we need to do on our own
545729 this is a clearcut like the old fashioned clearcuts that everybody knew would destroy watersheds would lead to erosion would lead to the siltation in our oceans in our rivers
545730 those precious places like clayoquot sound are getting fewer and fewer
545731 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace

545737 in the absence of good stories the pointless ones will have to do
545738 would you pay an extra 2 99 for a vanity code containing your favorite four letter word
545739 the bottom line is that good transit is frequent affordable easy to use and takes you where you want to go
545740 in the absence of good stories the pointless ones will have to do
545741 never in my years of visiting other libraries and this has been from one end of the globe to the other have i encountered any person who was more public relations minded in informing the passerby than mrs marjorie c keenleyside
545742 i met the most charming person who was bursting with enthusiasm about library work if only there were more people like mrs keenleyside speaking to future librarians perhaps we would have more library teachers
545743 a visit with mrs keenleyside the head librarian at roosevelt college is a rare treat for any librarian the warmth and enthusiasm she brings to an interview is not only inspirational but a miniature course in librarianship
545744 i have daughters and ive been thinking about this a lot and if they were faced with this decision i decided that at the end of the day i just want them to be happy
545745 do you think theyd be happy as part of the undead
545746 this is the coolest thing ive ever done by far
545747 what was jacobs game plan that edward admitted might have worked
545748 if you were bella would you want to be turned into a vampire
545749 a reputation for honesty gives you the cover to practice all manner of deception
545750 the mirror reflects reality but it is also the perfect tool for deception when you mirror your enemies doing exactly as they do they cannot figure out your strategy
545751 i was thinking of the girl that i left over you

545757 hey im going to snorkel up behind the enemy and get him with a sneak attack
545758 evil people can do some non evil things and most of them do that doesnt mean they arent evil
545759 a sword wields no strength unless the hand that holds it has courage
545760 wait until you see what happens and then define the metrics for your community
545761 will i be able to write anything else other than this dull and boring first post

545768 the king james was not given by god but was a translation by a group of scholars in the early 17th century who based their rendition on a faulty greek text
545769 the problem with communication is the illusion that it has occurred
545770 how can we possibly know anything about the creator if that entity exists
545771 all scripture is god breathed inspired and is useful for teaching rebuking correcting and training in righteousness
545772 augustus came from a miraculous conception by the divine and human conjunction of the god apollo and his mother atia
545773 how can anyone who is christian not think youre going to hell
545774 the bow of gods wrath is bent and the arrow made ready on the string and justice bends the arrow at your heart and strains the bow and it is nothing but the mere pleasure of god and that of an angry god without any promise or obligation at all that keeps the arrow one moment from being made drunk with your blood thus all you that never passed under a great change of heart by the mighty power of the spirit of god upon your souls all you that were never born again and made new creatures and raised from being dead in sin to a state of new and before altogether unexperienced light and life are in the hands of an angry god
545775 all non christ believing people at the time of their death go to hell
545776 salvation is accomplished by the almighty power of the triune god the father chose a people the son died for them the holy spirit makes christs death effective by bringing the elect to faith and repentance thereby causing them to willingly obey the gospel the entire process election redemption regeneration is the work of god and is by grace alone thus god not man determines who will be the recipients of the gift of salvation
545777 cant you see im making it its not ready yet just wait 30 seconds and youll have it and all this time that youve spent crying and making yourself miserable will have been wasted
545778 everything is the heaven and earth is yours o lord and this is your kingdom you are exalted as head over all wealth and honor come from you you are the ruler of all things

545790 things that have come up this year have been really unfortunate
545791 theres been a lot of media attention so its been tough to get to my locker when aaron is over here getting interviewed
545792 thats the only thing ive had to wait a little bit to get back to my locker
545793 i think in both brian and matt together you are seeing them get more comfortable with the speed of the game more comfortable in the pocket
545794 thats what you look for in young quarterbacks so im very pleased with the progress they have made so far
545795 but i feel like ive done a pretty good job of picking things up obviously theres been a few mental errors here or there that i need to clean up but thats part of the learning process the more reps you get the better youre going to get at running the plays
545796 i learned a lot in college from my experience and i learned a lot about myself
545797 i grew up a lot in that situation ive learned i have a hard head i dont let things sink in and get to me i just stay calm and do what i can do when theres things out of your reach that you cant control why worry about it just worry about yourself
545798 if i worry about stuff like that then im not going to be able to perform the best i can
545799 right now im a rookie you have to start somewhere and in order for me to achieve my goal of becoming a longtime quarterback in the nfl i cant worry about things i have to try to progress myself as a quarterback and try to get better each practice because i believe my best football is in front of me so you cant worry about things
545800 yeah thats obviously a job i want to hold on to
545801 but right now im just trying to get better and hopefully impress the coaches
545802 its going to be a lot of fun i just cant wait to get out there and see what it feels like

545807 before you were lucky to be in one maybe two olympics as you had to go and earn a living
545808 but now athletes can make a living through marketing and endorsements so they can extend their careers
545809 if you look at top performers in their 40s 50s and 60s the volume of training hours per day is sometimes down but they keep the intensity high they usually also do things to prevent age associated declines in muscle mass
545810 all things being equal the person who can put forth a maximum effort and at the same time relax has a real edge a lot of it is learning how to compete in a relaxed way when the pressure is on
545811 you have to be realistic i have nothing against this guy its nonsense

545854 the written transcript of the articles and hearing testimony is very powerful showing how mr bush abused the u s military and american citizens the articles provide evidence that members of the house and senate armed services committees and u s flag officers should also be prosecuted for abuse of the u s military and families of the dead and maimed that is one reason why congress is so reluctant to vote all 35 articles onto the house floor they implicate congress along with the president

545880 he is a top player who will want to prove himself in every game i feel our fans are behind him i feel that was more disappointed love
545881 to me face to face he always told me he wants to stay at the club and it finished like that so i believe what he told me
545882 he is not going anywhere even if you come with a 747 plane full of money
545883 experience wise we are a bit short in midfield but we will see with diaby not being injured denilson being available we have quality in there
545884 we are not close to signing anybody and i will focus on the players i have if we can find someone then we will do it if not i am happy as well
545885 last year we were really really unlucky we were only four points adrift and lost only three games
545886 in two of those we were leading 1 0 until 15 minutes before the end
545887 this was a little different scrimmage than weve had in the past
545888 we kept a lot of guys out in the scrimmage because we really wanted to look at some people that were competing for maybe not starting positions but certainly the depth of making the football team
545889 so in fairness to those young guys we set it up a certain way
545890 i feel like every time you step on the field you have something to prove
545891 im the biggest back weve got hopefully i bring some power
545892 i never can catch myself at any time without a perception
545893 many people automatically think this song is degrading women but i put my own twist on it to praise women the girls who want to be a future milf can all relate us young men are watching you and we like what we see
545894 we understand it might be beneath a worldwide celebrity of barack obamas magnitude to appear at town hall meetings alongside john mccain

545910 women and cats will do as they please and men and dogs should relax and get used to the idea
545911 passing a resolution like that puts a lot of burden upon obamas candidacy and injects something that should not be injected
545912 drop the idea of a big march on sunday august 24th
545913 while there is plenty to be critical about in terms of the democratic party leadership we would not want people to see this as an anti democratic party protest
545914 the american people voted to restore integrity and honesty in washington d c
545915 if you fall into the orientation of trying to make the democrats be what they are not and never will be you will end up becoming more like what the democrats actually
545916 agreed that obama is part of the system and i agree we need revolution but unless that is around the corner we have to be realistic and support obama

545923 i fully agree with general washington that we must protect this young nation from an insidious influence and impenetration
545924 for over 1700 hundred years the jews have been bewailing their sad fate in that they have been exiled from their homeland as they call palestine
545925 if you do not exclude them in less than 200 years our descendants will be working in the fields to furnish them substance while they will be in the counting houses rubbing their hands i warn you gentlemen if you do not exclude the jews for all time your children will curse you in your graves jews gentlemen are asiatics let them be born where they will or how many generations they are away from asia they will never be otherwise their ideas do not conform to an americans and will not even though they live among us ten generations a leopard cannot change its spots jews are asiatics are a menace to this country if permitted entrance and should be excluded by this constitutional convention

545941 this will be a way for china to show the world what it is capable of
545942 i think it is going to be the biggest show of its type ever seen
545943 the ceremony wont make people forget all the controversies but they might put them aside for just 3 hours
545944 some previous ceremonies have been truly extraordinary and i have no doubt that the chinese will match that at least if not take it on to another plane
545945 but frankly these things go on for too long and it is getting increasingly hard to wow people

546016 i had a friend like that in high school laurie same height as me and she was like triple something halfway down the alphabet
546017 you should take a day at least to read the next one give yourself time to absorb what you just read to think about it maybe even discuss it with someone whos read it too
546018 reading a book is like making love the experience should be savored
546019 i didnt say fucking i said making love theres a difference you know boinking and making love are two totally different things boinking is like grabbing a burger at mickey ds as opposed to a home cooked meal when youre hungry it takes care of the
546020 okay check it out youre attracted to the book by its subject the author or maybe even the art work on the cover for whatever reason that book calls to you youre initially attracted to a man by
546021 okay so when youre attracted to a guy what do you do you check him out from all angles inside and out to see if hes someone worth spending time with you do the same with a book you hold it in your hands caressing it studying the front cover checking out the back pausing to read the synopsis blurbs from other authors and reviewers about the book all of it meant to draw you to the book to encourage you to take the book home with you just like a mans flirting and courtship is done in hopes that youre going to take him home with you eventually you flip open the book glance at the type and size of font used in the book maybe if youre like me and touch is very important so you rub your finger tips along the paper to feel the quality of the paper youre getting to know your book like you would a lover before taking him into your body
546022 were talking about books and how she thinks theyre like lovers
546023 the first few chapters are foreplay and as it goes on you really get into what youre doing youre starting to lose yourself in the book the outside world is forgotten all your attention is focused on whats in front of you you fly you soar your pulse accelerates and your heart beats faster it all depends on whats in the book you take your sweet time with it you dont want it too end to quickly then finally you finish the book thats your climax the last thing you see before you close the book is the authors picture and you smile maybe you even stop and read the little blurb about him her thats like the last the deep kiss you give your lover before collapsing after the love making is over a thank you for the orgasms for the time spent worshipping your body after you close your book you lay it your lap and you just sit back and let the experience wash over you totally satisfied that the time was well spent and looking forward to it again when youre done making love you just dont hop out of his bed and into someone elses do you na man you lay back in the arms of your lover and revel in what just happened you may be a little sore a little tired but its all good and you feel peaceful reading a book for me anyway is the same way i like to give it some time before i move onto another book because if the last book was any good its going to stay with me for a bit just like a good love making session the memory and feelings still linger long after the act is done
546024 mmm this is really good anyway thats the way its for me
546025 real friends tell you what you need to hear not just want you want to hear

546303 pride is the shirt of the soul put on first and put off last

546306 indeed one might say that as far as the doctrine of justification you
546307 before the internet when we had time to do stuff relax amp think
546308 the insurance company often uses the cost to repair the vehicle as a gauge for determining the extent of injury to the vehicle occupants
546309 statistically minorities elderly and the disadvantaged drive vehicles with below average safety ratings or older vehicles they are also more likely to not have access to healthcare then when they say that they are hurt the insurance company simply states that there was not enough damage to the car to cause injury this often leaves the injured person in pain without proper treatment unable to work and with medical bills everyone with an injury needs good legal representation and thats what my firm does
546310 the vehicle safety does have a major impact on occupant injury but so does the pre injury health of the occupant and the forces generated during the collision
546311 many insurance carriers do not understand that each occupant has a different threshold and risk for injury an 18 year old healthy football player will have a lower risk of injury than an 89 year old female with osteoporosis and osteoarthritis there are literally thousands of factors that are involved with an injury but the cost to repair property damage is not a major factor
546312 this leaves the injured person wondering if they are really in good hands
546313 the elderly disadvantaged and some minority groups do appear to get taken advantage of that is why our firm investigates each claim and protects the rights of the injured we see many cases where the client did not immediately seek legal advice or may have gotten advice from an attorney that does not specialize in personal injury we still fight hard for these individuals but it makes our job much more difficult i recommend that any person injured get immediate legal advice from lawyers that specialize in personal injury
546314 insurance companies send private investigators to spy on injured victims at their church

546328 corruption by a limited number of powerful individuals and failure of leaders and institutions to control or prevent corruption does not imply that a country or its people are most corrupt
546329 i stress the importance of conducting awareness campaigns because the state is not the only one responsible for anticorruption
546330 we tried to learn about other countries experiences in fighting corruption and what the public opinions are in societies that fight corruption
546331 ti does a lot regarding anticorruption first it consolidates national transparency it supports the countries that have system of transparency and offers expertise and consultations for countries

546335 the president did not talk to the field leader of the diehard huthi fighters
546336 the huthis have opened the blockades of most of the garrisons that were besieged before the truce
546337 the huthis have actually taken over several positions and villages which were not in their domain before
546338 in yemeni mosques one can find overlapping and varying styles of architecture decoration and carvings dating back to various ages and nations
546339 observers cannot differentiate between them as they often find native yemeni turkish african and indian carvings in one image which depicts the integration of all of these peoples and the mixing of their civilizations
546340 the diversity in yemeni mosque architecture indicates yemenis ability to incorporate the civilizations of other nations in such a way that retains each nations characteristics
546341 this web site is one of the mediums we use to spread awareness among youth about the damages and diseases that result from chewing qat
546342 the site targets youths because they are the new generation and the builders of yemens future its easier to keep them away from qat now because most of them arent addicted to it yet
546343 well first introduce the committee to youths and then elaborate our activities to include many governorates
546344 we should be taught not to wait for inspiration to start a thing action always generates inspiration inspiration seldom generates action

546348 i understand you are a shaman i would love to know how you came about it and what it is that you do
546349 all i understand about shamanism is what ive seen on tv in travel programmes where they go into dream worlds and take trance inducing drugs
546350 for this reality its similar to the idea of different dimensions
546351 how long do the trance journeys last and are they like meditation or hypnotherapy

546786 what im saying simply reflects this reality and i think we might as well accept it and contract the size of state governments and accept that state mps can do their function in another 20 years on a part time basis and that you can have as few as five ministers running states
546787 theyve lost industrial relations theyve lost taxation power over petrol and alcohol theyre bound by the gst to be more dependent on federal government handouts
546788 the new sentences will be completely transparent what youll see is what youll get
546789 we certainly agree that the sentences should be more explicable to the public so that they understand them so that truth in sentencing does exist but we dont want to see people suddenly getting locked up for one third longer

546802 i wonder if some people feel a need to branch out to anti vax propaganda because it feels like consistency with a belief in the invincible immune system
546803 vitamin a is a potent immune booster and some research indicates that it helps to limit the worst side effects of measles
546804 sec 44 1 and 44 2 of the terrorism act 2000
546805 there are also powers to stop and search vehicles and their occupants 44 1 and pedestrians 44 2 in an area if a senior officer authorises it to prevent acts of terrorism
546806 for these three powers the officer does not have to have reasonable grounds to suspect the individual stopped or searched of carrying dangerous instruments or offensive weapons or of involvement in the anticipated violence or terrorism however these powers may only be used by police officers in uniform
546807 plain clothes police officers made sure people who tried to avoid the scans were checked
546808 acting on the request of the ipcc the police sought legal advice from the department of justice on whether a police officer in uniform was obliged to show his warrant card on demand by members of the public
546809 a warrant card rather than a uniform is evidence of an officers appointment as a police officer under the police force ordinance cap 232

546814 a treatment of limited effectiveness that has some use in some patients
546815 ironically or perhaps idiotically one of the founding members of the society of homeopaths believes homeopathy can be used to treat the aftermath of genocide

546818 the course is playing great the pins were a little easier than they were yesterday and the greens were a little softer
546819 the pins were just not as crazy i think the usga kind of listened to some guys and they did a good job with the setup
546820 i think tomorrow the key is going to be the front nine the group of guys that goes out there and lights it up on the front
546821 our dominance rises our supremacy emerges to be placed on high
546822 weve been waiting to use it for a while to be honest but theres a few new fellas that obviously needed a bit of work so weve been working on it to make sure everyones up to speed

546824 it was fine towards the end i guess the lungs ran out of puff a wee bit but i got through pretty good i was pretty happy to be back out on the field
546825 they never got any hot football and some of the tackles that went in forced turnovers and we put the ball at the right end of the paddock
546826 this keeps us alive in the tri nations and the bledisloe cup
546827 we dont underestimate the magnitude of that task weve got two away games now
546828 i think the next contest against australia is going to be massive because both teams will have equal edge its just a matter of edge and tactical approach
546829 i think its great to get as high as that
546830 at the beginning of the year a lot of people were asking me if my new setup after splitting with coach brad gilbert was going to work and questioning if it was the right thing for me to do
546831 i think my results showed that it took a little bit of time but that its paying off and im enjoying myself much more on court
546832 im much calmer and obviously my results have got better and better as the years gone on
546833 there are many clergy in britain who are living with their partners
546834 many are out to their congregation and out to their bishop but no one is willing to say it out loud its not dishonesty but an unwillingness to be honest
546835 im here because i would like to make it possible for those who would like to be open and honest to do so

546837 thats why i have security during the entire time im here i had similar death threats at the time of my consecration
546838 i have no interest in being a martyr im just trying to be a good bishop
546839 those who claim to make a plain reading of scriptures are actually interpreting it as well we all interpret scripture

546859 in another 20 years therell be very little left what im saying simply reflects this reality

546861 these notices are in place for a reason to protect victorians
546862 we dont take the decision to ban products lightly but once we have made that decision we will do all that we can to ensure unsafe products are not sold in victoria
546863 traders need to be aware if you sell banned products in victoria you will be caught and prosecuted
546864 people people people look at the evidence the truth is there you just have to look for it
546865 henceforth no jew no matter under what name will be allowed to remain here without my written permission i know of no other troublesome pest within the state than this race which impoverished the people by their fraud usury and money lending and commits all deeds which an honorable man despises subsequently they have to be removed and excluded from here as much as possible

546868 somehow i was healthy enough to stay there and the redskins extended their grace to me allowing me to play on this same team one city raise my kids there serve that community be loved by and love it for 20 years it transcends football this is out of this world
546869 whether i deserved to have played in the nfl or to deserve to even be in the hall of fame i just love the game
546870 i loved to play i loved being out there being inducted into the hall of fame is truly an honor and an awesome moment in my life but as great an honor as this is its not what really defines who i am or what ive been able to accomplish in my life
546871 i am proud that he is joining the elite group of 49ers players that are enshrined in canton
546872 as one of the dominant defensive players of his era fred was perhaps one of the key performers in the 49ers first super bowl team especially considering he had joined the team five games into the 1981 season his acquisition played a direct role in two 49ers super bowl championships his career as a standout player cannot be overstated
546873 since learning that i have become a member of the most prestigious club of pro football my emotions have been overwhelmed i am truly humbled
546874 perhaps the biggest reason i am here is because i played the game with respect and honor
546875 making it here today i feel more humbled and blessed than ever before in my life
546876 i stand before you a proud and gracious man i am truly honored to be the 247th member of the pro football hall of fame
546877 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
546878 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
546879 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
546880 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
546881 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

546887 they pick the most dangerous enemy they can find and its themselves
546888 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
546889 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
546890 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
546891 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
546892 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price

546929 pero se le ha reiterado que no se recorte el presupuesto del poder judicial para contar con los recursos que implican los gastos necesarios en la delicada labor de impartir justicia en el pa s
546930 esa apreciaci n es incorrecta existe una corresponsabilidad entre el chofer y empresario en los dos casos denunciados por la procuradur a ayer por ejemplo es evidente la responsabilidad de las empresas porque le entreg el veh culo a un chofer que tiene licencia de conducir cancelada y encima embarc pasajeros
546931 en estos casos estamos hablando de que las empresas pese a conocer que los choferes solo pueden conducir 5 horas en el d a y 4 en la noche los hac an trabajar hasta por 12 horas obviamente ese hecho contribuye a la comisi n del evento delictivo

546945 we are really talking about something that is irrelevant to the overall dependency on oil
546946 what we need to do is to be moving to alternative energies and most importantly to conservation
546947 i cant think of an idea whose time is less appropriate than this one
546948 a plan to drill here is no plan at all its a handout simply a handout to the oil companies its a terrible idea and drilling will do nothing to cut todays gas prices

546962 i said to president bush that its not possible for people to just lie on the beach after so much work after so much meeting and negotiation i think if the problem between india and the united states is resolved an agreement will be signed

546979 infections have in fact been rising among men who have sex with men as the data show a steady increase since the early 1990s
546980 these data among men who have sex with men point to an urgent unmet need
546981 we have never before been able to directly measure hiv rates in the united states
546982 we have not been able to see the leading edge of the epidemic
546983 this is a national crisis we need to have a coordinated national aids strategy
546984 it certainly underscores the need to reinvest in scientifically proven prevention programs for men who have sex with men
546985 rabbi we know you are a teacher who has come from god for no one could perform the miraculous signs you are doing if god were not with him
546986 i tell you the truth no one can see the kingdom of god unless he is born again
546987 how can a man be born when he is old
546988 surely he cannot enter a second time into his mothers womb to be born

546997 would literally take away with one hand what has been given with the other
546998 the nsg guidelines apply to non nuclear weapons states nnws so our preference is for the nsg to simply say that these guidelines do not apply to india if they are unwilling to say that at a minimum the requirement of full scope safeguards and other prescriptive elements in the guidelines that are intended for nnws must be waived for india
546999 if you read the nsg guidelines as a whole right at the top it says these prescriptions are for non nuclear weapon states there is an enunciation of the requirement that countries must accept full scope safeguards there is language about what happens if one of these states tests there is restrictive language on enrichment and reprocessing enr equipment and so on
547000 of course we are very clear that there cannot be any linkage with nuclear tests
547001 but just as in the 123 agreement with the u s there cannot be any explicit linkage to nuclear testing as a condition in the nsg
547002 i am not interested in labels like the npt definition of a nuclear weapon state because we are what we are
547003 but certainly we dont want the other label to be attached to us either
547004 are any of these elements present in those agreements so our view is that all these things in the nsg are extraneous tomorrow if the political situation changes all these things can create difficulties
547005 zimbabweans must realise that the country is in a practically binding state of socio economic emergency

547057 we left our homes to save the lives of women and children who came under attack by the bloody hamas gangsters
547058 hamas has once again proven that it is a treacherous party that has a lot of palestinian blood on its hands

547061 the challenge today in education is not quantity more or even quality that is improving and can be dealt with by the state but it is in content and character and the content of character
547062 in the 21st century we are not just talking about quantity and doing just more or even doing better
547063 if you look at jamaican society today i have to say we are lost in freedom we are positively lost in freedom
547064 we have had much greater quantity in education without the corresponding civilisation that should come with it
547065 materialism prevails getting a food seems now to be the purpose of life
547066 can we deconstruct slavery and colonialism by just allowing things to go on

547132 we believe that we have a strong economic course of action to take australia through these difficult global economic times
547133 that clear direction has to be based on responsible economic management and responsible economic management remains anchored in a 22 billion budget surplus a buffer for the future
547134 there are signs that the economy is slowing but there are still lots of strong features of the australian economy theres still lots of reasons why we are in good shape compared with all the other major economies in the world
547135 we had a situation where it was over heating where government spending was growing too fast we had inflation at a 16 year high the former government was not investing in skills and infrastructure
547136 but its crucial that we dont get spooked by one or two bad sets of figures
547137 that will keep the economy ticking along reasonably well in my view
547138 yes the economy is slowing yes we need to take the steam out of inflation but people talking recession are getting way ahead of the facts
547139 we certainly dont believe any credit downgrade would be appropriate
547140 credit rating agencies put companies on negative watch after events like last weeks writedowns and they then review the situation as we go forward
547141 the banks in very good strong shape and at an operating level things are going extremely well but thats a matter for us to sit down and talk to the ratings agencies with and to assure them thats the case
547142 weve had a succession planning exercise going now for about 18 months and wed planned for some months to make an announcement
547143 when we made those provisions we discussed whether we should delay this announcement and separate the two events but in fact john stewart himself said he thought it was better to go ahead with it
547144 it was in the interest of the company to make sure we had a sensible transition period before he leaves at the end of december
547145 the characteristics required of a chief executive include very strong strategic thinking ability very good people skills ability to identify people and build a great team and also strong operational experience which hes had and cameron had a terrific combination of those skills
547146 if he gets an opportunity then we know hes going to be a lot better than what he did last week
547147 but if he gets double teamed then hopefully other guys in our forward line we ll restructure our forward line a bit differently this week and give ourselves the chance to kick to different players and not just hally

547157 his crime was to dance with the paramilitary bosss girlfriend at a party
547158 one night at 10pm one of the paramilitaries placed a gun against his head and shot him we were told to pick up the body at 2am
547159 the attorney general was hugely opposed to the extradition of the 14 paramilitary leaders
547160 why did the government have to extradite them just then and not after they had finished giving testimony
547161 its a bigger problem each day because each day more people are moving into the areas where condors are

547166 even the baylor head coach was not there probably less than half the time i noticed conspicuously that a lot of the other head coaches were not at the games
547167 coach pelphrey made an all out effort to impress a j and his family on how badly he wants him to be a razorback
547168 i showed what im capable of and i should be rated higher than im rated now
547169 i went up against some of the highly rated offensive linemen and i got the best of them it was a good experience for me
547170 ive looked at their facilities on the internet and i like what i saw
547171 it was pretty much touching bases seeing how theyre doing
547172 its just something that normally happens during the recruiting process
547173 its been a lot of driving and a lot of traveling its been fun going to places ive never been to like arkansas oklahoma and spending time with my family
547174 of course we wanted to win the whole thing but our kids were competitive and we are really excited to win three games
547175 you have to place them in there right the washer needs to fill first then you add the detergent last of all you add the clothes
547176 right the ones i had to rewash because you washed them wrong the first time and you used your generic fabric softener sheets no wonder they smell so bad stay out of my laundry

547180 sometimes ill put on a happy color because thats the end of the work week
547181 like this sunday i hope im playing good im wearing red and white with some black and white golf shoes trying to make a little statement thats what its all about out here
547182 i wore them for a while i was trying to get a contract with the company that made them and they didnt do it so i said to heck with it
547183 remember doug sanders and those guys they wore their red white and blue shoes
547184 i thought you could wear a bunch of outfits with beautiful shoes with red white and blue patent leather and stuff like that
547185 now the guys come out and play in tennis shoes golf wasnt designed to be played in tennis shoes youre supposed to have a little flair out there
547186 doug had i dont know how many different pairs of shoes and the colors tangerine and plum and colors that you wouldnt be caught dead in them but he wore them and wore them well
547187 but i think back in the late 60s and 70s there were some pretty strange looking things that everybody wore
547188 we were walking with the bell bottoms and the wide white belts and look whats coming back the white belts the skin tight shirts
547189 most of us have kind of been there done that or maybe have thought about it and rejected it for the most part thank goodness
547190 can you see some of us out there in outfits like that come on i mean ive been ribbed so many times about the si cover in 74 the white belt now you dont see those guys with dark belts theyre all white belts so give me a break we were setting the stage for these kids
547191 but i tell you do not swear at all either by heaven for it is gods throne or by the earth for it is his footstool or by jerusalem for it is the city of the great king and do not swear by your head for you cannot make even one hair white or black simply let your yes be yes and your no no anything beyond this comes from the evil one
547192 i hope that whoever did this that they would come to know christ
547193 i hope and pray that my husband gets a chance to meet them in heaven and gets a chance to shake their hand and gets a chance to forgive them himself
547194 the third world war must be fomented by taking advantage of the differences caused by the
547195 if moses didnt write the first 5 books of the bible its a big lie

547198 i know about the mark of the beast but i cant find anything on a 1 world government

547242 dear craig so i did join your tt lifestyle and am very glad that i did i learn a lot from it started with great success to do my shopping only on perimeters of all stores eat mostly row and fresh veggies and fruits i am so glad on your point of view on eating fresh fruits i started with intermediate workout and already see results beside loosing 7 lbs i also lost one inch from my chest and hips and two inches from my waist i think its just great i missed last tt transformation contest but will keep an eye on maybe next one i also really enjoy your support on line your newsletters and pictures of your cute dog and your abs i need to mention to you that i am not a youngster i am 61 years young quite fit and happy with positive outlook on life so your program is just great for me thank you for your great motivation
547243 i have been using turbulence training for about 3 months now and am ecstatic with the results as a full time graduate student i spend long hours in the lab and many of those hours involve stationary work and sitting hunched over a desk at a computer i was in a rut physically and needed something to get me back in shape and give me some more energy luckily in my off hours i researched fat loss methods i stumbled across craigs tt program which was exactly what i was looking for short yet very effective workouts that can fit into anyones schedule based on methods proven in scientific studies can be useful to anyone regardless of fitness level as craig says if the workouts dont seem hard enough than you are probably not using enough weight but you can even start at the bodyweight level if you have not worked out in awhile plus the workouts require minimal equipment you get great nutrition information and you get access to the online forum which is invaluable being able to actually communicate on almost a daily basis with the person who created the program is one of the best parts of tt click here for the tt forum and there are plenty of other people on the site with tons of useful information who may have gone through similar experiences since starting the tt program i have dropped 15 lbs more than 5 bodyfat and over 3
547244 it was dec 31 2007 and i saw in the mirror the effects of holiday indulgences on my waistline i wasnt significantly overweight compared to the average american which is not a standard to be proud of but i was at an all time high weight for me of 169 pounds on a 5 foot 6 inch frame i subscribe to mens health magazine where i noticed the belly off program designed by craig i signed up that day my goals were 1 a waist to hip ratio of 0 92 2 a body mass index of 25 and 3 body fat of 12 percent i religiously completed the eight week bodyweight 500 belly off program and was astonished at the results in all my years of regular exercise ive never experienced a change in fitness like this i lost 11 pounds in eight weeks most of the weight was shed from my mid section which is just what i wanted my arms and chest became better defined and i started to see abs on a 47 year old guy i was psyched to continue the progress since completing the belly off program ive continued with the diet and ive used workouts from craigs turbulence training program changing the routines every month im now down to 152 pounds for a total weight loss of 17 pounds and have achieved my body mass index goal i lost 3 5 inches on my waist and 2 75 inches in my hips im not quite at my waist to hip ratio goal but thats okay because ive lost inches in my hips i dont have a reliable measure of my body fat percent but my pants are loose enough to satisfy me that ive made great progress there too i cant believe how successful craigs programs has been for me its the best decision ive made for my fitness since i committed to regular exercise two decades ago thanks craig

547246 in another 20 years therell be very little left what im saying simply reflects this reality
547247 i think we might as well accept it and contract the size of state governments and accept that state mps can do their function in another 20 years on a part time basis and that you can have as few as five ministers running states

547251 it logged into the administrative area and followed the delete link for every entry
547252 my dumb ass boss still didnt want to uninstall alexa could have strangled the man

547304 crime is just a symptom the problem is economic we need more jobs in the city good well paying jobs is the solution
547305 i really hope dr shaw if he takes the job can get things done he really understands the achievement gap the community is dying for someone to come into that position and start making decisions

547307 she and many other providers come here for a literacy based event with their kids this thursday for example each kid will receive a copy of where the wild things are to take home a toy connected with the book and also a pass to the museum for the kids to bring home to their parents

547319 no one really knows who he is because he cant tell them
547320 thats a big burden imagine waking up every day and having a whole part of yourself you cant tell someone about that leads him to question whether or not its worth it and he starts to go the other way kind of a downward spiral

547325 that certainly adds a little bit extra to the boys and they enjoyed doing it so we decided right at the start of the week that it would be time to do it
547326 it was fine towards the end i guess the lungs ran out of puff a wee bit but i got through pretty good i was pretty happy to be back out on the field
547327 they never got any hot football and some of the tackles that went in forced turnovers and we put the ball at the right end of the paddock
547328 this keeps us alive in the tri nations and the bledisloe cup
547329 the banks in very strong shape and at an operating level things are going extremely well but thats a matter for us to sit down and talk to the ratings agencies with and to assure them thats the case
547330 the course is playing great the pins were a little easier than they were yesterday and the greens were a little softer
547331 the pins were just not as crazy i think the usga kind of listened to some guys and they did a good job with the setup
547332 i think tomorrow the key is going to be the front nine the group of guys that goes out there and lights it up on the front
547333 sales are very very strong and were looking forward to when the a380 begins to fly
547334 they knew qantas was a premium airline but this takes it one step further
547335 i said the battle for premium passengers is fought on the ground and in the air
547336 comparing to what american airlines offer they couldnt believe it
547337 i think its great to get as high as that
547338 at the beginning of the year a lot of people were asking me if my new setup after splitting with coach brad gilbert was going to work and questioning if it was the right thing for me to do

547340 im much calmer and obviously my results have got better and better as the years gone on
547341 fraizer campbell has taken his goal very well and it wont do him any harm hes an aggressive young player very quick and determined and he can do well
547342 his future lies here because dont have any strikers we only have wayne rooney and carlos tevez so fraizer comes into that area
547343 we are also hoping to apply for a work permit for manucho who comes from angola that will give us more back up
547344 carrick and rooney have been struggling with a virus for a few days and they wont be fit for the juventus game on wednesday hopefully they will be ready for the communtiy shield game

547351 there are many clergy in britain who are living with their partners
547352 many are out to their congregation and out to their bishop but no one is willing to say it out loud its not dishonesty but an unwillingness to be honest
547353 im here because i would like to make it possible for those who would like to be open and honest to do so
547354 i received a number of death threats before coming here
547355 thats why i have security during the entire time im here i had similar death threats at the time of my consecration
547356 i have no interest in being a martyr im just trying to be a good bishop
547357 those who claim to make a plain reading of scriptures are actually interpreting it as well we all interpret scripture
547358 we have changed our mind about a lot of things

547360 as far as i know hes never gotten in a single fight
547361 he was always big on travelling he didnt like to sit in one place
547362 i got a phone call from a guy who talked to a guy and he told me and i had to see it for myself
547363 she told us that in fact they didnt know that tim was the victim in this crime until last night when a journalist came to their house and knocked on the door
547364 obviously theyre wondering why the rcmp did not come and inform the family for such a long time
547365 then to get the knock on the door and to find out that its your son its your brother i cant imagine how it must have been for them and that shock is written on their faces
547366 tims sister told us the family feels they really cant say a word not even to speak about tims life until they can assemble the family together and they can come up with a joint statement
547367 the one thing that i noticed about tim was that he never took anything seriously
547368 i dont think tim is the type of person to take any crap from anyone
547369 tim you were the best guy ever you didnt deserve this at all
547370 fortunately she didnt see full details head on but she saw enough that shes pretty traumatized

547390 and the rate of those people moving doesnt keep up with the influx of new registrations
547391 but we predict well see the numbers take a big jump by november
547392 it strikes me that youve had a surge in registration john mccain isnt going to fire up a lot of republicans to go out and register
547393 youre adding more latino voters in san diego and latino voters tend to break democrat
547394 weve displaced a lot of the old military economy and replaced it with an information economy and college graduates tend to break more democratic than republican were no longer a town of military retirees and retirees in general these are the big shifts
547395 we are stepping up as part of the state party and the mccain campaign
547396 thatll probably demonstrate itself between now and the middle of october
547397 i dont think anybody would deny that republicans have been on the defense for a while
547398 with senator mccain i think youll see an invigorated national brand with the republican party
547399 were down to a 2 percent gap with the republicans and that gap is shrinking very quickly i think by november were going to see the democratic candidate have more votes than the republican which is not something we see in the county
547400 im aware were behind in escondido but theres great pride that la mesa recently turned blue and del mar turned blue

547423 your low doses over time assertion has been repeatedly falsified by empirical studies

547425 the health risks particularly the development of solid cancers in organs rise proportionally with exposure at low doses of radiation the risk of inducing solid cancers is very small as the overall lifetime exposure increases so does the risk

547446 if this had happened around some kind of rock song with a lyric that really meant something a bruce springsteen
547447 but for something as and i dont mean to belittle it because i still think its a great pop song but its a pop song do you know what i mean it doesnt have any kind of weight behind it as such but maybe thats the irony of it
547448 if i was a young kid now looking at that song id have to say id think it was pretty naff really
547449 something which is seen to be particularly cheesy or tacky or in otherwise poor aesthetic taste
547450 for me its a good example of what some of the 80s were about in that pop sort of music way a bit like you could say debbie gibson was absolutely massive but if you look back at it now do you know what i mean
547451 were getting the internet to appear in the real world
547452 how can it be overloaded when it only had 80 00 page views today and 400 000 yesterday

547455 nearly one out of three household heads has never used a computer to create a document
547456 these data underscore the significant digital divide between the connected majority and the homes in the unconnected minority that rarely if ever use a computer
547457 a critical mass of families now has broadband internet access and that creates an opportunity to take online learning to a whole new level for a new generation and thats exactly what pbs kids play is designed to do
547458 pbs kids play is a natural extension of the pbs mission to advance childrens learning with new innovative media approaches

547460 perhaps you should run along and let us grown ups talk

547469 when i wake up the only wreath in the house is one of cigarette and marijuana smoke that lazily curls around the naked bulb in the ceiling of our studio apartment
547470 australia will come back they will change things a little bit weve just got to keep growing but were happy with where were heading
547471 probably the best thing was because we were under a lot of pressure and theres a group of young people involved in the team and there are a lot of new faces and for those guys to experience that and come through on the other side is i think really good for them
547472 youve got to try things and if you dont try things you dont learn things
547473 he lawrence certainly has a good handle for it and he does a lot of work on it i know that and he reffed quite well last night

547476 had masturbated while driving just before he was stopped for speeding on the 130km h stretch of the stuart hwy
547477 he also video recorded himself masturbating while travelling at a speed of 150km h
547478 visibly agitated and when they told him they were going to search his holden sedan he said
547479 found the drugs at a rest stop 100km north of coober pedy and he intended to smoke all of it at his noonamah home
547480 even though normally you would say four shots youre right in it i think its going to take a 6 or 7 under par round from one of those guys to catch all four of us because all four of us are playing well
547481 i expect at least one and probably two or three of us to have good rounds in the 60s tomorrow and force the guys behind us to catch up with birdies i dont think all four of us are going to come back to them so theyre going to have to go make birdies to catch us i believe
547482 today will be the best of whatever scoring is left out there i think tomorrow if you shot 3 or 4 under that would be excellent golf if we have conditions with the amount of breeze that we had which was varying between well at least a half a club i guess
547483 i want to play more like the first two rounds a lot of pars a scattered birdie here or there so im not giving a lot of shots back
547484 i think in the end the marathon type mentality or trying to outlast will end up winning
547485 thats what the best players in the world should probably shoot under a tough test so it probably does have a major feel
547486 if i get off to a good start its tough to follow birdies when you know you have to make birdies
547487 but on the other hand its nice to be in the last group and know what you need to do
547488 im just delighted about the consistency i know that winning is very fickle i went three years without winning and then won twice within four weeks winning is strange sometimes it doesnt go your way sometimes somebody else plays a bit better
547489 i could easily be u s open champion but i didnt do the job when i needed to all you can do is give yourself chances and ive given myself a lot of chances
547490 its not going to be there tomorrow when i start off im going to go out there and focus on the day and see if i can put it up
547491 still a long way to get the job done though but its certainly a very comfortable spot to know good resources to use knowing that ive come back after an awful nine holes

547575 i dont have the fun of having sex personally life is never simple
547576 i dropped some friends who disappointed me i was pretty ruthless
547577 but i couldnt write the real dark side because i didnt want to hurt anyone it has to be surface
547578 i keep telling everyone in my life do not even think about writing a memoir until everyone is dead its impossible to write about things without hurting people everything i wrote was true but it was a version of the truth
547579 the person i was able to write most honestly about was my mother had she been alive i would never have been able to write such things about her
547580 everyone was okay because i wrote such a loving portrait
547581 i wrote down every single thing my mother said bearing witness to it all was my way of coping
547582 when i put my writer hat on i asked myself whats the most evocative scene
547583 i just had to pick and choose every sentence was verbatim writing the book was my mourning period because i was just in shock for a year or two
547584 the manuscript is pretty much intact as i wrote it
547585 my editor took out one section about a boyfriend that was it
547586 the doctors i wrote about that i liked i kept their real names
547587 the book was published exactly as i wrote it of course the language was cleaned up but my editor just trusted me and allowed it to be
547588 there is a lot of stuff that i couldnt write
547589 it would probably be a more glamorous job if we were hanging out with the actors
547590 every other writer went to recharge on a beach between grueling writing sessions while i traveled from cancer center to cancer center

547592 i dont know how id feel if id never written the book
547593 we have secret high hopes for oprah that kind of visibility can save peoples lives
547594 the 0 release was very limited and were now getting over that
547595 the range of platforms has expanded again where kde 4 0 was basically a linux only desktop for 4 1 were realizing the cross platform benefits that we had in mind for kde 4 so it runs on free software operating systems like freebsd and opensolaris and also on proprietary systems like mac os x and microsoft windows thats one of the reasons that it was important to get kde 4 0 out relatively early to mark a line in the sand and kick off the porting efforts for kde 4 i know both the freebsd and opensolaris kde communities had 4 1 in mind as a good target to make available on those platforms
547596 kde 4 1 is a significant release for the project because 4 0 was controversial for some with its architectural breaks and some quality issues
547597 in that respect this is the service pack 1 equivalent to a windows release while i havent installed it on my kubuntu instance yet 4 1 is generally getting positive reviews and seeing the kinds of reactions youd expect from a follow on update
547598 seeing the reactions to kde 4 0 has hammered home an important message to us as a whole i think its not 2003 anymore and the number of users willing to use linux and try new software has grown enormously
547599 the demographics of our users are different now the message of stick with kde 3 until kde 4 matures enough for you didnt get through loud enough kde 4 1 sends the message kde 4 is mature enough for early adopter desktop users and i think well be putting on the remaining polish to get it to casual users within the kde 4 1 lifespan of about six months
547600 something else that stands out to me and forgive me if it seems trivial but the hovering icons in the startup screen have now had their reflections adjusted to appear all in the same mirror earlier versions had reflections floating around in strange places
547601 a tiny graphical change like that stands out because in general kde 4 is so pretty to look at and so consistent i know theres plenty of grumbling about the looks all i can say is that i like them that a small mistake stands out like that id like to congratulate the artists on their attention to detail even in the face of tremendous work pressure
547602 in a piece i wrote a few years back i echoed marks belief that pretty is a feature obviously there must be substance behind the eye candy but apples ability to wow via its pretty ui is certainly instructive
547603 how those looks are achieved and with what technologies many hold up qt the framework upon which kde is built as the answer because its easier to design good looking applications with it than with gtk gimp tool kit its gnome counterpart but gnome is more popular with enterprises and has a lead in adoption there plus there are licensing issues so its a difficult question to answer
547604 for me on a free software operating system kde succeeds when it doesnt matter what os is underneath it just works regardless and were pretty darn close there
547605 ive looked at a number of other specimens sat in a few other wagner auctions but this is the one that makes collecting worth while

547700 they keep going and going and going and going and
547701 the retreat at the parliament building will give the leaders the opportunity to have unstructured talks in an informal atmosphere
547702 saarc declarations are divine but the devil is in the detail
547703 we need collective action to wipe out terrorism in the region
547704 conectar me a uma rede no meu local de trabalho
547705 comments of that nature come from a biased reading of reality
547706 were simply a political team that has worked for a long time with the same vision and common ideas about the society we want
547707 should be taken up as an instrument of economic policy
547708 its summer and lets do a feature on how someone has changed for the better
547709 im not going to say any school or any coachs name
547710 but ive been told somebody will buy me a car and my mom a house ive heard it several times i tell everyone i cant be bought
547711 the practice of sport is a human right every individual must have the possibility of practising sport without discrimination of any kind and in the olympic spirit which requires mutual understandingwith a spirit of friendship solidarity and fair play
547712 zato su osnovni proizvodi kod nas daleko skuplji nego u zapadnoj evropi to nikako nije normalno jer su plate kod nas 350 evra a tamo 1 500 2 000 evra tu ne to opako ne tima zna i maloprodaja nam zida zna ajan deo cena
547713 as coaches we do the best we can every day and so do our players
547714 im going to do the best i can just like i did before
547715 i dont see how in this economy customers are expected to absorb these price increases
547716 we need to come to the realization in ohio that we have had relatively cheap energy for a long time and inevitably it was going to catch up with us
547717 aeps commitment to ohios future a plan for purchasing and supplying solar wind and other renewable energy sources contributes 75 million of shareholder money to aid struggling ohio bill payers and positions the company as a partner in efforts by the state to attract new businesses and new jobs to the state according to the companys press release
547718 quero destacar a firme convic o de quem fala ela e do presidente lula de que a integra o importante na vis o dos dois pa ses
547719 o assunto em doha era o que colocavam os pa ses desenvolvidos nessa negocia o e o que os pa ses emergentes colocavam mas n o era um bom neg cio para os pa ses emergentes e especificamente para a rep blica argentina com um desenvolvimento industrial inferior diferente do que tem o brasil
547720 hoje por suas pol ticas constantes o brasil tem uma empresa como a embraer e n s n o temos nada por isso temos que aplicar medidas que sejam permanentes no tempo
547721 a import ncia da argentina como um pa s altamente competitivo
547722 recentemente o presidente da fiesp federa o das ind strias do estado de s o paulo paulo skaf disse numa entrevista a um jornal argentino que a argentina hoje muito mais competitiva que o brasil na hora de se investir
547723 e isso tamb m muito importante para a integra o
547724 e tamb m quero ressaltar a visita do presidente ch vez acho que a integra o da venezuela ao mercosul algo mais que importante especialmente num momento em que o mundo discute energia pre os e alimentos
547725 voltaria a fazer todas as coisas que fiz e tamb m diria que voltaria a aplicar a resolu o 125
547726 quando kirchner chegou presid ncia em 2003 tamb m diziam que eu mandava que eu chamava os ministros que eu gritava com eles
547727 mas n s dois somos militantes h muito tempo e defendemos com id ias a sociedade que melhor queremos para a argentina para nossos filhos
547728 quero dizer para voc s que terei imenso prazer de estar com a imprensa nos com cios que vou fazer para os candidatos do pt aqui na regi o e nos com cios que vou fazer para a companheira marta suplicy l em s o paulo n o pensem que n o vou fazer porque vou fazer n o hoje porque hoje o rei da festa o s rgio nobre que est tomando posse como presidente do sindicato

547730 because how we spend our days is of course how we spend our lives
547731 hes put so many contingencies around it that i wonder in fact i question whether he would do it at all
547732 it may be a way for him to gain favor during the election and tube it later because all the contingencies werent met
547733 believes that finding consensus is essential to solving our energy crisis
547734 i just stopped talking about it because it became a distraction
547735 mediaset richiede 500 milioni di euro per i video rubati a you tube e google
547736 you have to turn down loads right and left because they dont pay enough to justify the expense of the diesel
547737 these prices have affected the market tremendously for guys running 10 to 15 trucks to 30 trucks to 200 trucks
547738 all the industries that are doing all the shipping need to be more understanding with the truckers and help support them through it
547739 its not a real big shock everything has gone up
547740 this year there is nothing that has come about indicating theres going to be a summer program
547741 we try to get funding but it has not come about at the present time
547742 until congress and other leaders identify the money we need to operate the program we wont
547743 he was that type dude you know shirt off his back type guy you know and that rubbed off on everybody
547744 we did what grandpa would probably want us to do and thats ride go carts and bumper boats and anything that had to do with four wheels
547745 i could tell you as a father i am very proud of my son bryce cain and sawyer and you know theyre champions and thats all he would ever want them to be
547746 i think the discussions are moving ahead and i hope we have something resolved by monday i think weve gotten to the point where we kind of have to force it
547747 primarily it starts with whether brett favre wants to play football and then second whether the packers want him to play for them
547748 i was interjected into it because there was a tampering charge initially
547749 im not looking for things to interject myself to its an issue that needs to be addressed because of the competing interests you want to make sure its done properly and within our rules this is an issue that ultimately has to be decided between brett and the packers
547750 whats going on between brett and the organization is something that the players and coaches we cannot handle
547751 were not involved in it i think they did a good job from a responsibility standpoint dealing with it for about two days but the focus has been on improving
547752 koharu you and ai check out the other room well meet back here
547753 kay maybe i can find some breath mints or something in one of the drawers
547754 save me one i swallowed it down back there but it was a close call
547755 it belongs to one of the people from that list we found ryoko yokohara
547756 wow really really go to the back whats the last date
547757 says october 2nd but it doesnt look like she kept it regular the one before that is september 12
547758 maybe itll tell us more about what was going on
547759 i mean jesus its like he cant live with the concept that a weekly might go out without his name on it and he hasnt done sh since the may disaster except to try and convince everyone that it was chins fault so much for not speaking ill of the dead sanctimonious prick
547760 leo and i talked over the implants yesterday thats going well hes
547761 there was a minor scare in d on wednesday in 101 somebody left the
547762 i should probably get over to d myself make sure everythings ready for tomorrow
547763 if were in a sayu and reina are in d
547764 kay maybe i can find some breath mints or something in one of the drawers
547765 save me one i swallowed it down back there but it was a close call
547766 there was a minor scare in d on wednesday in 101
547767 if were in a sayu and reina are in d
547768 we found a journal it says that the strain of the virus used to
547769 did either of you touch anything do you have any cuts any small wounds that might have come in contact with anything
547770 we found a journal naming it as the room where they were infecting the trisquads
547771 well duh we figured that much out in about two seconds
547772 oh thank god i had the worst feeling all the way over that something had happened we found the researchers in block a matsuuras note at the boathouse was right she killed them and our she has a clear identity now ai seems certain that its tomoko niita she was the one ai recognized from the list and she has a rather sordid history she can fill you in when we regroup
547773 i just i suppose i let my imagination run wild for a moment
547774 jeez hitomi i had no idea you cared or that you thought wed be stupid enough to stick ourselves with dirty needles in a place like this
547775 probably in the next test area by now i saw them safely off to block b before i came here did you find test seven
547776 its one of those where you have to figure out the next in the series
547777 its one of those where you have to figure out the next in the series
547778 the letters stand for the months january february march april may june july its j the last letter is j
547779 and have ai take a look when we get across
547780 do you know what that means revved up the amp time
547781 im pretty sure she means that niita sped up the amplification process amplification is the term for a viruss spread through a host
547782 not really she mentions something called ma7s a couple of times but nothing more specific than that theyre a virus experiment that didnt work and shes definitely kind of a jerk
547783 okay thats an understatement ryokos a money hungry amoral bastard
547784 when you specialize in one field particularly when its a field that demands linear thinking and a very defined focus on only one tiny element of kind of hard to explain but its frighteningly easy to get lost in that single element to forget theres a world outside of that element when you spend your days looking into a microscope surrounded by numbers and letters and processes some people get lost and if they were unstable to begin with the ambition to pursue that element can take over making everything else unimportant
547785 sorry to crash but we figured you girls could use a little chaperoning
547786 we need to update and i have a few things id like to go over
547787 they found the room but didnt touch anything did you find anything else useful
547788 it looks like there are only four trisquads though the entry that mentioned it is a few weeks old
547789 thats excellent reina and sayumi had another encounter outside of d managed to get five of them that means there may only be one team left
547790 id like to do a quick recap to make certain were all on the same page before we go any further in short this facility was used for virus experimentation and has been taken over by one of the researchers for reasons unknown the other workers have been killed and the offices purged of incriminating evidence ai believes that the biochemist niita tomoko is responsible and the fact that the grounds are still being patrolled suggests that shes alive somewhere in the compound though i dont feel we should concern ourselves with trying to find her weve already completed two of the tests given to us by dr matsuura through notes and my hope is that the material he has hidden for us will be the evidence we need to formally charge the government with criminal activity
547791 obviously theres already plenty of proof that illegalities have occurred here we could leave now wait it out for risa and eri and turn the matter over to international authorities my concern is that we still dont have enough hard evidence on japans involvement other than the computer systems software and the journal that koharu and ai found the governments name isnt on anything and both of those could be explained away my feeling is that we should continue with the tests and find whatever dr matsuura meant for us to have before we evac but i want to hear from each of you about it first musume or non musume this isnt an authorized op were not following orders here and if you think we should go we go
547792 well weve made it this far and if theres only one more group of zombies out there i say we finish up
547793 yeah and we still havent found the main lab we dont know why niita did this whether she suffered a psychotic break or is actually hiding something we may not find out but its worth a look plus what if she destroys more evidence after weve gone
547794 if this crazy scientist lady is as deeply involved with our government as it looks were not going to get another chance this may be our only chance to dig up a connection and were already so close the third test is right here we do that one were one step away from finishing
547795 whats eatin you you know something youre not telling us
547796 no nothing like that i just i have a bad feeling or rather a feeling that something bad is going to happen
547797 where were you when we got here and im the one who cant remember anything
547798 thank you reina id almost forgotten so its decided then lets solve our next puzzle shall we oh ai take a look at sayumis eye while were at it its giving her some trouble
547799 maybe i just didnt try hard enough and it works well for other people
547800 i will return the product tomorrow there is plenty of time i dont need to hurry
547801 buy our product now to learn how to stop having this nasty problem
547802 men neme dan de stronk koolgroente en men gooie de koolgroente over naar de tweede speler
547803 niet meer alles achter me laten vallen maar meteen opruimen
547804 esta forma de solu o tem se mostrado muito eficaz na continuidade dos neg cios em familia
547805 dat ontbijt zou veel lekkerder smaken als je een voetbal van de olympische spelen had gehad
547806 dit moment was zo veel ontroerender geweest met een voetbal van de olympische spelen
547807 wat wordt er gedaan tegen terrorisme en wat kunt u doen
547808 erg handig om te weten als terrorist fijn dat je zon boekje in je brievenbus krijgt moest ik direct aan harry potter denken
547809 als we allemaal opletten kunnen we de kans op een aanslag verkleinen let u vooral extra op in situaties waar veel mensen bij elkaar zijn op metro en treinstations bij festivals of concerten in winkelcentra let u in elk gebouw op waar de nooduitgangen zijn laat uw eigendommen niet onbeheerd achter etc
547810 wat moet ik doen als ik merk dat mensen in mijn omgeving radicale idee n verkondigen als u merkt dat mensen in uw omgeving anderen proberen te overtuigen van radicale idee n die een gevaar vormen voor de nederlandse samenleving kunt u hierover het beste praten met de politie u kunt ook bellen met meld misdaad anoniem 0800 7000
547811 een aantal personen bereidt in het diepste geheim terroristische daden voor
547812 maar de van dale is het hier niet mee eens sa men span nen onov
547813 het plegen van zwaar geweld met als doel politieke of godsdienstige tandpunten aan anderen op te leggen
547814 when we finally pass our own act i will request that you form a dev canada and transfer ownership of my wife to that organization i love my daughters but im quite content with you owning them i can live with you owning my wife you cant help yourself peer you will do what is best for these women
547815 look at us what do you see randolf wants a son or two if you would consent to use us randolf could have a grandson to carry on the name
547816 after they return from holiday with their families every woman on the embassy staff has been converted
547817 you own them we looked at setting up an american corporation or trust so that our women would be protected from your yank enslavement laws canadians cant currently own slaves or companies that own slaves were working on that you should be getting calls from the new zealand australian and british embassies after the new year your mr harrington is working on establishing an american trust specifically for managing non american slaves canadian families who send their daughters to live work and attend school down here have been advised to seek dev conversions and have their daughters attend college on an education asset contract
547818 thats why the new trust is being formed all canadian citizens will have a clause that will transfer ownership to the canadian edition of dev as soon as the canadian slave law passes oh by the way canadians look down on exposing slaves in public we have federated all of our police forces so go ahead and expose your slaves when you like i know that many of your slaves no longer want to wear clothes i just had a delightfully productive appointment with your carla to map out my daughters er your canadian slaves education the younger ones will start attending the susan b anthony school for gifted girls next month alina has already graduated and she would like to teach at eastlake university
547819 sir why not simply get diplomatic immunity for your staff
547820 not every staffer rates diplomatic immunity my wife gave up hers in order to set the example we wont risk those rather brutal slave laws you yanks made up if they are already slaves they cant be made slaves
547821 master randolf and elizabeth share our religion they share our belief that all women should be slaves too some cultures wont allow this not yet
547822 so how will this affect your political career when you become prime minister
547823 i would feel much better if you were to brand or tattoo my wife and daughters and the other five staffers if you mark them as yours you will more likely protect them
547824 canada has barely 56 000 men and women in its military establishment we have another 18 000 mounties our thin red line is really thin you are more likely to investigate the disappearance of one of your own heaven help the people who hurt your charges
547825 id like to have some of yours if you would let me i understand that this is the custom in cougar county too us old hags taking a young man as a lover
547826 how old are you i need to know because ill check the records
547827 the records will say 41 but elizabeth is actually 38 youll have to take my word over the official record
547828 im actually 13 years older than my official record you may snuff me now if you wish
547829 ill stick to the official records thank you for being candid
547830 i dont believe you no i need to act as if i do yet i need to also pretend that the official record is correct elizabeth for example could be 38 or 38 or 41 i cant tell you shawna could pass for late 20s too if you have a fountain of youth or something we need to either share it or keep it secret
547831 those are our secrets long ago we had the ability to renew our bodies when the world became modern we gave it up too much danger of being burned at the stake for witchcraft right now the easiest and safest way to get a new body is to be ritually sacrificed and born in a new body yes you dont believe that either dear boy it is possible to live forever who would want to it is like never being able to forget anything you have forgotten your previous lives or you couldnt do what you must
547832 i can see you thinking i have no idea what is going on inside your mind but i can see that you are thinking
547833 sometimes dear peter forgets to have fun because he is always thinking thats just peter and it suits his destiny peter is supposed to rule from the head and not the heart he has us pearls to provide his heart we just have to earn his trust and remain trustworthy
547834 as long as you are my slaves and when you are with me then ill have you follow my dress and grooming code that means total nudity when practical no body hair and ill have to decide on a case by case basis on your scalp hair does anybody here need a slave boot camp so that you can accept being a slave no good i wont have you shave your head sometimes i do that so that the woman can leave her old identity behind being naked all the time helps she is either so aware of being exposed that she cant think of anything else until she gets used to being nude or she leaves her obsolete free woman identity behind with her old wardrobe there is another adjustment that you need to make recognition that you all are no longer in control of your lives never were though most people never figure out that they didnt control their lives thats how many women wind up enslaved thats how they get into a bad slavery situation youll find out that most of the family member enslavements are more or less voluntary but those that arent will overwhelmingly be due to attempted manipulative activities on the part of the woman whining self destructive behavior withholding sex
547835 all sorts of childishness the woman reverts to childish when under stress because she survived that behavior in the past just like a lot of men revert to brutality when they were younger brutal spelled survival we human animals tend to revert to what worked for us before well we think that worked for us more likely we just survived our own folly and mistook the source of our own misery for a way to survive
547836 peter is not the caesar type he would rather someone else take the spotlight
547837 shawna how do i screen and monitor women for the caligula syndrome
547838 absolute power corrupts absolutely ambassador sometimes i hesitate to act because i fear becoming another emperor caligula he acted out of warring emotions caligula may have been mentally ill i have only read what his enemies wrote but it could happen to me i have established checks and balances so that i dont destroy myself but i will depend upon women slave women to run dev and other programs i cant be everywhere at once
547839 you are the primary balancing agent for us when you discover a slave abusing her power take it from her that is what you are supposed to do that is also why you are going to sacrifice me any woman who becomes the high priestess of our order must sacrifice her life we are only allowed a few years we priestesses select the next high priestess the great mother and you are charged to remove her at the end of her reign you also remove her when she commits treason against the order that is why we are forbidding any of your sisters or children or those who you designate as wives from holding that office it is too much to ask for you to kill a part of yourself
547840 i noticed that many of your women have permanent hair removal would you do that to us all of us my daughters and me
547841 like i said i want you to mark them as your own doctor prince explained to me about sheep and wolves and sheepdogs i see you are afraid that you will let everybody down let me tell you a secret my lad you will rise to the occasion you can do far more than you think you can how does a college student party all night and then go to class the next morning
547842 what poor example no wonder so many of your co eds wind up dropping out now they can get enslaved for that
547843 thats why i enslaved them two let themselves get into a dangerous demonstration
547844 no the secret to rising to the challenge is that you must husbands and fathers work long and hard when theyd rather not because their wives and children depend on them housewives live as poorly as slaves do because their husbands and children depend on them soldiers shake off fear on the battlefield fire fighters rush into burning buildings we do what we have to do
547845 slavery will be good for the majority of women in it because they will be forced to be better people or they will be killed most owners will be decent people those that arent decent to their slaves may escape justice for a while but that caligula disease sounds devastating having the power of life and death over another changes people ive been to war i was a subaltern in princess pat and i saw soldiers become indifferent brutes one thing i fear about slavery is that being able to use women for sex will destroy the capacity for love thats not going to be a problem for you
547846 i have an attachment disorder i get fond of people
547847 you will do what is best for people you are fond of whether they like it or not whether they like you or not thats your nature you wont change

548107 obamas talk was similar to those that the actor bill cosby and others have been giving for years admirable as they are they also reinforce the belief that irresponsible parenthood family breakdown and educational failure is primarily a black latino phenomenon obamas intention was hardly to help fix the idea more firmly in the book of national truths which are not true nonetheless a better sister souljah moment would have been delivering his speech to an all white audience they badly need to hear it
548108 electoral politics being what they are you cannot blame the first african american candidate for not finding a white audience to scold about how they bring up their children actually obama has come close to it in many of his speeches he has mentioned getting kids of all backgrounds off their cell phones their ipods im grand theft auto iv facebook and junk tv
548109 doubtless obama would raise these topics from the white house lectern but with a collapsing economy a war or two and a world in turmoil family and child rearing is not going to be a major theme of his time in office
548110 other than cheney and gore no white political leader has carried the message to the caucasians who judging from the ever diminishing accomplishments of their offspring are in as urgent need of getting the word as persons of color when the topic is brought up white people as well as members of other groups slough off their responsibilities by blaming the schools and the teachers
548111 if and when we get serious about raising a generation of literate children we will see that the area is a minefield hundreds of billions of dollars in sales would be threatened if growing up in america ceases to be all about getting stuff and having a good time
548112 the xboxes and ipods will not be put away merely because a parent says so somebody has to make sure that the child does it as of now there are not many people who want that job or are in a position to take it on
548113 millions of parents cant they are working trying to put food on the table as a nation we have shown we are not able to build an adequate child care system for children whose parents must work the suggestion that mothers or fathers stay home touches off a firestorm as does the corollary idea of family allowances or paid parenthood
548114 it is to his credit that obama has gone as far as he has in this minefield others will have to go farther if a new dawn is to break it cannot be left for him to be the only public figure to call americas parents to account wanted are legions of celebrities public figures politicians of both parties gadflies and agitators to pound home the word that america is running out of generations of young to endow with an inheritance of helplessness and incompetence
548115 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
548116 there is a class of colored black people who make a business of keeping the troubles the wrongs and the hardships of the negro race before the public some of these people do not want the negro to lose his grievances because they do not want to lose their jobs there is a certain class of race problem solvers who dont want the patient to get well

548137 if he doesnt run his race its not about whether hes beaten by horses that are better its somethings wrong
548138 if he doesnt run his race wed have to retire him hes supposed to win he was supposed to win the belmont anything less than a win somethings not right hes not only likely the best 3 year old he may be the best horse out there there are still people saying theyd love to see big brown face 2007 horse of the year curlin people are willing to forgive the belmont
548139 i think that if mike were going to take them he would just take them instead of just telling me he was going to take them mikes not the threatening type of guy you know
548140 with rick i think what the media is doing is making it a soap opera
548141 i was upset with rick for one reason that he didnt tell me he had a positive test when we came out to the world that we were going medication free i voiced my opinion strongly to rick and he told me it would never happen again
548142 when the interest came in from liverpool it was the only thing that could have ever taken me away from tottenham and thats the reason why im here
548143 i couldnt have left tottenham for any other club i think that if i didnt come to liverpool id probably have regretted it for the rest of my life
548144 im a striker and the manager sees my playing up there
548145 we havent spoken specifically about what he wants me to do but i have to earn that right
548146 its kind of like the way it worked with dimitar berbatov and myself at tottenham with a big lad and a smaller lad alongside him
548147 this project isnt about profit or revenue its about having a direct relationship with fans and building a supportive online community its about coming together and creating a work of art that i could never accomplish on my own i think its a general concept for all of life but for indie artists especially that there comes a point where you cant proceed further on the journey if you are standing alone
548148 he is a top player who will want to prove himself in every game i feel our fans are behind him i feel that was more disappointed love
548149 to me face to face he always told me he wants to stay at the club and it finished like that so i believe what he told me
548150 he is not going anywhere even if you come with a 747 plane full of money
548151 experience wise we are a bit short in midfield but we will see with diaby not being injured denilson being available we have quality in there
548152 we are not close to signing anybody and i will focus on the players i have if we can find someone then we will do it if not i am happy as well
548153 last year we were really really unlucky we were only four points adrift and lost only three games
548154 in two of those we were leading 1 0 until 15 minutes before the end
548155 no youre not a geek you play guitar and you sing youre cool way too awesome smiley
548156 for four days senator john mccain and his allies have accused senator barack obama of snubbing wounded soldiers by canceling a visit to a military hospital because he could not take reporters with him despite no evidence that the charge is true
548157 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky
548158 as far back as the year 2000 the respondent has actually attempted to murder several other people either through poisoning he is a revenge killer when he feels that hes been slighted or has had especially toward women he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings
548159 has been forensically diagnosed by several top psychiatrists as a sociopathic homicidal killer i have that in evidence and through my working with him i also believe that to be very true
548160 people fail to realise that the success of the surge was the result of a tacit agreement between the us and iran

548170 ive looked at a number of other specimens sat in a few other wagner auctions but this is the one that makes collecting worth while

548172 the mystique and allure of the t206 wagner card continues to grow
548173 new orleans got rid of me in 2006 but the vikings came along because they had defensive coordinator mike tomlin who was familiar with me from tampa mike left and they got rid of me a year later
548174 now im here with lions coach rod marinelli who is familiar with me from tampa and vikings defensive coordinator leslie fraziers got safety madieu williams because he was familiar with him from cincinnati
548175 the vikings said they got guys who were better than me behind me
548176 well i led the team in interceptions two straight years there and darren sharper was there with me
548177 so you tell me if they had better players behind me
548178 it probably always does have to do with off the field stuff
548179 i know dwight smith and what kind of person he is
548180 hes a rock jawed tough guy great ball skills instinctive he knows how i want the game to be played
548181 you really dont compare coaches because you know theyre all going to have different styles
548182 rod marinelli and i won a super bowl together so naturally our comfort level is better
548183 but ill say the one difference is were early in camp and we havent tackled to the ground yet in minnesota we would have had five six days of full contact to the ground by now why were professionals you shouldnt beat yourself up in camp like that

548190 my dad always used to give me and my sister advice like most kids we didnt always follow that advice
548191 a piece of advice he gave me once was never make athletes your heroes because they make mistakes too i guess i didnt follow that advice very well id like to introduce you to my hero my mentor my father emmitt thomas
548192 my late grandfather is still my hero i remember those long hot summer nights sitting on the porch listening to a game or a fight
548193 he taught me about honour commitment love religion and respect
548194 it happens when youre protecting someone like john elway and what happens is the night before the game you get little or no sleep
548195 because if you didnt do your job youll forever be known as the guy who lost our franchise i would also like to thank john it was worth every sleepless night
548196 ive looked at a number of other specimens sat in a few other wagner auctions but this is the one that makes collecting worth while

548202 its great bringing my movie to a place that i feel familiar
548203 theres something poetic about coming back to the place where i used to come for holidays camping trips with my dad and stepmother and my very large family
548204 she has such an incredible heart and such a generous spirit
548205 she does so much out of the glare of the lights to make the world a better place
548206 there arent a lot of role models for us in the world or people we can look up to

548212 we need collective action to wipe out terrorism in the region
548213 the patriots theres no way you can be environmentally conscious in new york
548214 id have to say the giants since tom brady uses way too much hair product to be good for the atmosphere
548215 wait wait can i change my answer the giants because the patriots represent an entity that strives to do good for its nation but fails whereas a giant is large entity that uses up the nations natural resources to survive so really both are symbolically making the effort but fail
548216 i refuse to settle for anything less than all the rights which are due me under the constitution

548226 we need collective action to wipe out terrorism in the region
548227 we have to guard against infodemics in which inaccurate false information is disseminated prompting social unrest that spreads like an epidemic
548228 the reality is that we lack the means to effectively deal with harmful internet messages
548229 the regulations violate the autonomy of the internet and are an effective tool for tighter media control by the government
548230 the regulations would bring about a reverse in the advancement of the internet media as a whole
548231 but the internet media should also serve public good and compared with other countries south korea has lacked the institutional control over the media in which people tend to expand and reproduce unverified one sided information

548236 the king wants no other price for the bride than a hundred philistine foreskins to take revenge on his enemies sauls plan was to have david fall by the hands of the philistines
548237 he was pleased to become the kings son in law
548238 when saul realized that the lord was with david and that his daughter michal loved david saul became more afraid of him and he remained his enemy the rest of his days
548239 saul sent men to davids house to watch it and to kill him in the morning
548240 then michal took an idol and laid it on the bed covering it with a garment and putting some goats hair at the head
548241 but saul had given his daughter michal davids wife to paltiel
548242 david wearing a linen ephod danced before the lord with all his might michal daughter of saul watched from a window and when she saw king david leaping and dancing before the lord she despised him in her heart ii samuel 6 15 16

548295 es reformista porque parte de la imperfecci n de la realidad y lucha contra los desequilibrios sociales mediante una pol tica gradualista pero constante que aporta nuevas cotas de progreso es liberal porque conf a en la capacidad de la sociedad civil para protagonizar ese progreso y se ocupa de facilitarle los medios sin caer en dirigismos que la desplacen y es integrador porque gracias a esas dos actitudes previas diluye las tensiones y convoca a toda la sociedad a trabajar desde un ambiente de respeto mutuo de di logo y de concertaci n
548296 ha sido un placer visitar el pabell n de un pa s al que le debo mucho ya que viv all tres a os maravillosos muchas felicidades por su propuesta recibid mi sincero afecto

548304 green arrow seems to be one of the characters in the wake of this phenomenal summer book ended by
548305 started out as a super villain escape idea and the idea was well we can either go marvel or dc
548306 and i talked to both of them and i kind of said well who can you give me because i needed a superhero that i can bounce off of and i dont know for my money it was if we went marvel it would be captain america if we went dc maybe green arrow and green arrow seemed like the best fit
548307 at this point nothings really been done that is permanent
548308 so im lobbying to be part of that ive been talking to the producers and saying its my creation in the end theres a certain logic in the design of it i know its different between benicios face and the wolf face because i sculpted that face i know how the anatomy changes i should at least be giving some guidance to the guys who are doing the transformation in cgi
548309 i got universal to hire some conceptual artists for me so theyre working tandem with me writing
548310 the second one came out and i havent heard a word and its been almost a year now i would imagine
548311 fox is probably going to take the sci fi wire
548312 it was interesting because when i was talking to the network i could sense some hesitation about what i had given them and i understood why i hit them with lets leave this ill tweak some of it which i was gong to do anyway and let me write what i refer to as a prequel because we come into this world with all of these people already
548313 it definitely has to do with the network and what i presented to them
548314 it was one of those situations where we were all very enthusiastic about the world we were building but they loved the pilot when they read it and then they saw it and they said ok this feels a little different than we thought it was going to
548315 you have to hand it to the doctor for dumping a slightly needy girlfriend by palming her off on a copy of himself
548316 he tried leaving her in a parallel universe and that didnt work
548317 i didnt have anything to do with the two hour telefilm
548318 i was brought in after the movie to create the series but what i found was that fans missed certain things like the turbo boost and the interaction between mike played by justin bruening and k i t t voiced by val kilmer
548319 i went back and watched the original series the first season and asked whats the mythology where are we going and how do we create this 25 years later its been all about taking the concept to the next level
548320 i absolutely bounced ideas off the writers there and asked for their help and advice at various points i probably could not have written this without them being there encouraging me and giving me good ideas when i didnt have them
548321 im not afraid of sci fi and i love it
548322 we didnt want to do this as a space opera we wanted it to be a familiar world but at the same time we are inventing a world we had a lot of fun inventing what this world is going to look like we are taking new york and impressing our own aesthetic and own iconography we got to have a lot of fun with that i remember talking to david eick about this when he was doing battlestar and he said they were always asking themselves the question what do doorknobs looks like we decided that we wanted to have things look like they could fit in our worlds but youre not sure what city it is
548323 it wont be a guest star it will be somebody who has graced your television screen on our program before
548324 i cannot confirm nor deny if i am alive or dead the final cylon or not in the series finale only that kara finds peace at the end
548325 the ending is a perfect way to finish the show does everyone and everything justice
548326 there is a lot of closure and still some questions left
548327 able to convince the network to let us air long episodes to take single episodes and make them double episodes and to take double episodes and make them quadruple episodes
548328 our episodes are always long and were constantly getting into the editing room with 10 15 sometimes 20 minutes of material that you cant get into an episode
548329 the story has become so critical in order to realize the arc of the series that we cant just cut stuff out and save it for later or push it til next year the stuff were used to doing its all got to be there

548333 he was a very nice polite guy we wouldve had no reason to let him go before all this happened
548334 that was unusual for him not to call back and then when he didnt show up for work on tuesday we got worried
548335 he was a little guy with a heart bigger than you could know
548336 tim spent his life traveling and meeting new people and always saw the good in everyone he had the most infectious giggle you could hear him laughing a mile away
548337 it didnt matter what kind of a day you were having because when you heard him laugh you couldnt help but join in
548338 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
548339 i had not cut my hair or beard for two years and the japanese were hunting me to kill me i looked frightening
548340 reverend sotutu visited the commanding officer and when he was told that all the known tracks were blocked by the enemy soldiers he said that if the enemy had blocked 99 tracks his god would open the 100th track and he could lead the entire group of about 600 to safety through that track
548341 by the time the enemy forces from all the known tracks converged on the airstrip they discovered that the 600 people they expected to capture had disappeared
548342 as far back as the year 2000 the respondent has actually attempted to murder several other people either through poisoning he is a revenge killer when he feels that hes been slighted or has had especially toward women he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings
548343 has been forensically diagnosed by several top psychiatrists as a sociopathic homicidal killer i have that in evidence and through my working with him i also believe that to be very true
548344 para m es uno m s uno y la renovaci n depender de c mo me sienta yo
548345 creo que para m en lo particular esto es importante porque sigo en el lugar donde quise estar siempre desde mi vuelta de europa y eso me deja muy tranquilo
548346 por ahora aguanto seis meses m s y despu s se ver
548347 va a ser muy dif cil sobretodo porque los equipos se reforzaron muy bien y van a presentar dificultades en la segunda parte de enero a junio porque hay muchos equipos en la copa y los grandes se entretienen jugando esa competencia y dejan espacio a los que vienen de atr s
548348 formando un buen plantel en todas las l neas y que sea parejo ten s la posibilidad de apuntar a las dos cosas aunque despu s el f tbol no es matem tica tampoco es previsible y puede pasar en que ahora en el primer cruce te quedes afuera hay que ir por todo y ver qu ser lo mejor
548349 no son jugadores previsibles y aportar n gol que son las cosas importantes vienen con ganas de mostrarse y todo eso es importante y les da un plus que tambi n lo transmiten al resto del plantel
548350 c mo se reforz y c mo se habla fuera del club pero despu s depender mucho de nosotros mantener ese esp ritu con respecto a lo que se habla y se dice nos da orgullo y nos pone bien pero a la vez es una responsabilidad doble mantener alto algo que se hizo dif cil llegar y que es dif cil siempre de mantener
548351 no hablo de favorito sino que lo importante es mantener la seriedad la humildad y las ganas de superarse y de trabajar y que es lo que van a heredar los chicos en el futuro cuando no est yo calder n y alayes por dar algunos nombres ser n ellos los que se formaron en el club quienes deban llevar esa bandera que hoy llevamos nosotros
548352 el manoseo que hubo alrededor del tema fue mucho y si bien todos esperaban una decisi n de lio no todos tienen en este caso la misma personalidad tal vez otro agarra la valija y se va pero otros como le paso a lio esper a ver c mo se resolv a el tema
548353 cada uno lo maneja de una manera distinta pero conoci ndolo bien s que se mor a por estar en la selecci n pero tiene otro car cter y lo manej de otra manera lo que vi mal fue c mo se manejaron el barcelona y la fifa en este tema
548354 eso es importante y te da un plus m s all de las cualidades futbol sticas que pueda tener cada uno
548355 el hecho de haber nacido en el club de ser de la ciudad y respirar lo que se vive en la ciudad es importante estos chicos que volvieron a gimnasia que son hinchas les puede hacer bien gimnasia es uno de esos equipos que se reforz bien y puede hacer un buen campeonato est equilibrado y con muchachos que juegan bien al f tbol
548356 se cerr un acuerdo entre los clubes y s lo restan detalles de la parte contractual
548357 the greatest battles of life are fought out every day in the silent chambers of ones own soul
548358 in my garden grew plenty of thyme it would flourish by night and by day oer the wall came a lad and he took all i had and he stole my thyme away
548359 i saw another woman with red hair a moment ago but her skin was too dark it just didnt look right
548360 do you know how many times youve tried to pull this on me i think this is the seventh maybe eighth time hell you were barely even trying this time ive seen you do better
548361 no one knows about that day or hour not even the angels in heaven nor the son but only the father
548362 woe woe woe to the inhabitants of the earth because of the trumpet blasts about to be sounded by the other three angels
548363 release the four angels who are bound at the great river euphrates
548364 the kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our lord and of his christ and he will reign for ever and ever
548365 all go unto one place all are of the dust and all turn to dust again
548366 whatsoever thy hand findeth to do do it with thy might for there is no work nor device nor knowledge nor wisdom in the grave whither thou goest
548367 i will ransom them from the power of the grave i will redeem them from death o death i will be thy plagues o grave i will be thy destruction
548368 for since by man came death by man came also the resurrection of the dead for as in adam all die even so in christ shall all be made alive
548369 for if the dead rise not then is not christ raised and if christ be not raised your faith is vain ye are yet in your sins then they also which are fallen asleep in christ are perished
548370 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life
548371 then came to him certain of the sadducees which deny that there is any resurrection
548372 now that the dead are raised even moses showed at the bush when he calleth the lord the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob for he is not a god of the dead but of the living for all live unto him
548373 who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they were
548374 that which thou sowest is not quickened xcept it die
548375 verily verily i say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit
548376 marvel not at this for the hour is coming in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice and shall come forth
548377 there shall be a resurrection of the dead both of the just and unjust
548378 all that are in the graves shall hear his voice and shall come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation
548379 for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first
548380 for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just
548381 as far me i will behold thy face in righteousness i shall be satisfied when i awake with thy likeness
548382 so also is the resurrection of the dead it is sown in corruption it is raised in incorruption it is sown in dishonor it is raised in glory it is sown in weakness it is raised in power it is sown a natural body it is raised a spiritual body
548383 we look for the saviour the lord jesus christ who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body
548384 thy dead men shall live together with my dead body shall they arise awake and sing ye that dwell in dust for thy dew is as the dew of herbs and the earth shall cast out the dead
548385 o death where is thy sting o grave where is thy victory
548386 neither can they die any more for they are equal unto the angels and are the children of god being the children of the resurrection
548387 and they the righteous lived and reigned with christ a thousand years but the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished
548388 and fire came down from god out of heaven and devoured them
548389 but the fearful and unbelieving and the abominable and murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death
548390 then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their father who hath ears to hear let him hear
548391 dear children this is the last hour and as you have heard that the antichrist is coming even now many antichrists have come this is how we know it is the last hour
548392 they the antichrists went out from us but they did not really belong to us for if they had belonged to us they would have remained with us i am writing these things to you about those who are trying to lead you astray
548393 who is a liar but he who denies that jesus is the christ he is antichrist who denies the father and the son
548394 for many deceivers have gone out into the world who do not confess jesus christ as coming in the flesh this is a deceiver and an antichrist
548395 beloved do not believe every spirit but test the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets have gone out into the world
548396 for if someone comes to you and preaches a jesus other than the jesus we preached or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received or a different gospel from the one you accepted you put up with it easily enough for such men are false apostles deceitful workmen masquerading as apostles of christ and no wonder for satan himself masquerades as an angel of light is it not surprising then if his servants masquerade as servants of righteousness
548397 beware of the false prophets who come to you in sheeps clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves
548398 not everyone who says to me lord lord will enter the kingdom of heaven but he who does the will of my father who is in heaven
548399 even though the false apostles claim to be christians even though they can perform signs and miracles including casting out demons in the name of jesus christ declares that he does not know them
548400 watch out that no one deceives you for many will come in my name claiming i am the christ and will deceive many
548401 at that time if anyone says to you look here is the christ or there he is do not believe it for false christs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and miracles to deceive even the elect if that were possible see i have told you ahead of time so if anyone tells you there he is out in the desert do not go out or here he is in the inner rooms do not believe it
548402 dont let any one deceive you in any way for that day will not come until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness is revealed the man doomed to destruction he will oppose and will exalt himself over everything that is called god or is worshiped so that he sets himself up in gods temple proclaiming himself to be god
548403 and then the lawless one will be revealed whom the lord jesus christ will overthrow with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the splendor of his coming the coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with the work of satan displayed in all kinds of counterfeit miracles signs and wonders and in every sort of evil that deceives those who are perishing they perish because they refuse to love the truth and so be saved
548404 the sum of your word is truth and every one of your righteous decrees endures forever
548405 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills

548420 i had no idea it would evolve into this kind of career i just loved doing it
548421 it got to the point where id be in the grocery store singing at the top of my lungs and people would tell me to just shut up already
548422 luckily i never encountered that problem of being typecast as one if you hear my music then youll know i sound nothing like them im a very intense person
548423 i was impressed that someone so young has such poise and maturity yet shes still a kid and a lovely warm down to earth person
548424 she sings with authority and power but still with a range of emotion and nuance
548425 hes probably my main influence i saw him at live 8 last year i was so far from the stage i wanted to get right up there to see him but i had a great view anyway
548426 were going to take another look at it and approach some of the songs in a new way

548428 as far back as the year 2000 the respondent has actually attempted to murder several other people either through poisoning he is a revenge killer when he feels that hes been slighted or has had especially toward women he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings
548429 has been forensically diagnosed by several top psychiatrists as a sociopathic homicidal killer i have that in evidence and through my working with him i also believe that to be very true
548430 id give a minute of my time to hear more
548431 my fellow members of the class of 2008 i am reminded as i stand here of one of the great text messages of our time
548432 due to the late date of the two parties nominating conventions and the relatively short period between the end of the conventions and the first proposed debate it is likely that the four commiss
548433 when somebody makes a complaint we come out and by first using our sense of smell we can tell whether there is a harmful substance
548434 drilling is out of the question because cheaper oil is not worth the possibility of damaging our precious landscapes or wildlife and we need to cut fossil fuel use because of global warming and high gas prices are the best thing to make that happen
548435 if something like bush lifting the ban on offshore drilling can cause oil to plummet by 16 barrel just think what 3 5 million new barrels onto the market would do
548436 but the u s energy information administration an independent statistical agency within the department of energy concluded that new oil from anwr would lower the world price of oil by no more than 1 44 per barrel and possibly have as little effect as 41 cents per barrel and would have its largest impact nearly 20 years from now if congress voted to open the refuge today
548437 but lets say that is true what good is wind or solar going to be in that time frame to power cars you could say electric cars but not in this time frame you cannot replace the hundreds of millions of gas powered cars in the u s within this time frame can you explain what is going to happen to the batteries from the hundreds of millions of cars when they wear out
548438 replacing hundreds of millions of gas power cars within this time frame
548439 access to the pacific atlantic and eastern gulf regions would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030
548440 do you think oil companies would sell oil to us consumers for one cent less than they could get from french consumers no where oil comes from has no effect on price
548441 then there are the distribution concerns and as youve mentioned battery concerns as it is well known that these batteries are every bit as bad for the environment as our other resources
548442 if something like bush lifting the ban on offshore drilling can cause oil to plummet by 16 barrel just think what 3 5 million new barrels onto the market would do
548443 every barrel of anwr oil production reduces crude oil imports by about a barrel
548444 then you say in 30 years gas will be 12 a gallon if this drilling will not effect the price of oil dont you think gas will not increase more than 2 a gallon over a 15 20 year period
548445 as for car batteries let me clear up my statement i was talking about the batteries that will be in electric cars have you thought about how to dispose of those
548446 as for you so called correction about transmission lines going to the

548448 every barrel of anwr oil production reduces crude oil imports by about a barrel
548449 looks like the dems would rather go on a five week vacation than debate what to do about the price of gas

548513 i have to say when i was told about the storyline i kind of agreed

548527 the privatization of public services and functions manifests the steady evolution of corporate power into a political form into an integral even dominant partner with the state it marks the transformation of american politics and its political culture from a system in which democratic practices and values were if not defining at least major contributory elements to one where the remaining democratic elements of the state and its populist programs are being systematically dismantled
548528 in 2006 the cost of americas spying and surveillance activities outsourced to contractors reached 42 billion or about 70 percent of the estimated 60 billion the government spends each year on foreign and domestic intelligence
548529 to feed the nsas insatiable demand for data and information technology the industrial base of contractors seeking to do business with the agency grew from 144 companies in 2001 to more than 5 400 in 2006
548530 if theres one generalization to be made about the nsas outsourced it information technology programs it is this they havent worked very well and some have been spectacular failures
548531 the key phrase in the new counterterrorism lexicon is public private partnerships in reality partnerships are a convenient cover for the perpetuation of corporate interests
548532 the separate bookkeeping and accountability devised for blackwater dyncorp triple canopy and similar outfits was part of a careful displacement of oversight from congress to the vice president and the stewards of his policies in various departments and agencies to have much of the work parceled out to private companies who are unaccountable to army rules or military justice meant among its other advantages that the cost of the war could be concealed beyond all detection
548533 bill clinton picked up the cudgel where the conservative ronald reagan left off and took it deep into services once considered inherently governmental including high risk military operations and intelligence functions once reserved only for government agencies by the end of clintons first term more than 100 000 pentagon jobs had been transferred to companies in the private sector among them thousands of jobs in intelligence by the end of his second term in 2001 the administration had cut 360 000 jobs from the federal payroll and the government was spending 44 percent more on contractors than it had in 1993
548534 outsourcing as a virtual joint venture between house majority leader newt gingrich and clinton
548535 boldest privatization agenda put forth by any president to date
548536 a neoconservative drive to siphon u s spending on defense national security and social programs to large corporations friendly to the bush administration
548537 every purchase you make with a credit card every magazine subscription you buy and medical prescription you fill every web site you visit and every e mail you send or receive every bank deposit you make every trip you book and every event you attend all these transactions and communications will go into what the defense department describes as a virtual centralized grand database
548538 so many former intelligence officers joined the private sector during the 1990s that by the turn of the century the institutional memory of the united states intelligence community now resides in the private sector thats pretty much where things stood on september 11 2001

548600 i walked with her for a bit and from her perspective maybe it was unwanted attention but she didnt make that clear
548601 it didnt seem like she was telling me to go away if shed told me to leave id have done so straight away
548602 that was at 12 33pm i know because just a minute before id made a call from my mobile to check how much credit i had left

548604 what changes will you make to provide our soldiers in theater with real access to mental health care
548605 what training has the pentagon provided our medical professionals in theater to recognize who might be at risk of committing suicide
548606 what assistance are you providing families here at home to recognize the risk factors for suicide so that they may help our service members get the assistance they need
548607 what programs has the pentagon implemented to help reduce the stigma attached to mental health concerns so that service members are more likely to seek appropriate care

548614 if we kill the goose that lays the golden egg as the europeans have done both we and the europeans as well as the rest of the world will be worse off because there are few other places for such medications to be developed
548615 think we should outsource our foreign policy to world opinion
548616 european sophisticates whom we are supposed to consult about our national interests
548617 weve got something special and were going to sell it to you in a big ass box full of cool ass shit that you wont be able to get anywhere else
548618 my brother and i get into an argument with a taxi driver about getting our change back he got on his mobile phone and all of a sudden at least 15 greeks with baseball bats batons and chains appeared out of nowhere
548619 they demanded we hand over our wallets i think they look for any excuse to hook into tourists
548620 my brother was able to run and seek help and so only received minor cuts and bruising but in trying to reason with these thugs they punched kicked and belted me with their weapons for a 10 minute period
548621 i tried to run but it was very late at night and we were in a secluded part of the island with no one else around to help i was bashed so severely that my eye socket was smashed to pieces requiring major surgery when i returned to london where i am currently living
548622 my whole eye orbit had to be reconfigured with three metal plates and 12 screws the experienced surgeon who operated on my eye told me that i was lucky to be alive and just as lucky to still have my eye
548623 on all the evidence that i have seen the risks associated with allowing this cross bred cat into the country when we already have up to 12 million feral cats wreaking havoc on native fauna are simply too great
548624 that is why i have banned the import of these cats immediately
548625 the first objective is in the context of the framework convention on climate change to determine the factors of emissions in order to carry out an inventory of greenhouse gases released by the sector
548626 the countries of the developing south according to the convention must adopt measures but are not obligated like the industrialised countries to reduce their emissions that is why we want to know for the countries like new zealand that do have an obligation how much they emit and how they are going to cut emissions
548627 i am unable to see any movement on the ground
548628 some are born great some achieve greatness some have greatness thrust upon them and then there are others

548630 some are born great some achieve greatness some have greatness thrust upon them and then there are others
548631 with the liberal party youre dealing with not a question of personalities its policies
548632 what weve inherited from 12 years of mr costello as treasurer is the second highest interest rates in the developed world together with his being part and parcel of a government which was engaged in climate change denial and work choices
548633 so on that score ive got to say its quite clear cut to me that the liberals whoever their leader is have a real problem with their policy direction for the nations future because of the legacy they left us from the past
548634 ive got to say their problem is one of policy of being locked so far into the past theyve lost their way personalities i think are secondary to it
548635 im not going to make any judgments with regards to the federal coalition they will decide their own course of action
548636 but what i would say is i agree with trade minister simon crean i mean we can speculate and talk about things but people dont necessarily reward those people that want to go in there and to basically destroy behind the scenes
548637 but id just say in so far as brendan nelson is concerned he has shown tenacity and its a difficult job being an opposition leader i know that but youve really got to do the hard yards and thats what its all about
548638 it government doesnt fall out of the sky in your lap youve got to work for it
548639 compare it with the way prime minister kevin rudd and treasurer wayne swan are going were on the verge of a rudd recession after 11 golden years of costello and howard
548640 now of course wed like costello to come back because he can manage the economy and rudd and swan cant
548641 if i was peter i would have taken up the leadership back in december
548642 plainly he is an extraordinarily talented man but we have a leader hes had a tough week and i dont want to make it any tougher for him
548643 i think that what we need to do is rally behind the leader we have got rather than speculate about leaders that we might have had once and sadly have not yet had and probably never will
548644 i would be rolling out the red carpet for him tomorrow if he wanted to stay in the parliament but its all hypothetical because he hasnt given us any indication other than the one back in december that he was going
548645 we all wish that he would come back but he has given no indication that he would
548646 we believe that we have a strong economic course of action to take australia through these difficult global economic times

548729 this is a tax that will go through every household and every small business in australia
548730 in plain language for real australians trying to feed clothe and house children and raise families and run small businesses and survive as pensioners and carers the emission trading scheme is a tax
548731 mr rudd has a responsibility to describe how compensation is going to work
548732 plague pestilence and disease famine death drought and bleaching of the great barrier reef
548733 mr rudd is wanting australia to believe that if australia does not act then that will be the outcome
548734 the truth is if the world does not act and the science is right then that will be the scenario
548735 if this sort of impact is sustained over this calendar year theres no chance the government will get the benefit of the additional revenue it has counted on in its budget he said

548743 they look for who can do the job now if the person is leaving on maternity leave in a couple of months and somebody else is there rather than starting all over again they might say this new person has some advantages
548744 a lot of employers regrettably still look at this as something which is detrimental to their business
548745 this mentality of employers is very damaging and belittling to women it makes women feel that theyve done something wrong by being pregnant

548811 de christenunie straalt uit dat zij een direct lijntje heeft met boven en dat wij allemaal dwaallichten zijn terwijl het standpunt van staatssecretaris bussemaker heel logisch en wel overdacht is
548812 veel mensen zijn principieel tegen abortus en zeggen liever een embryo vernietigen dan een foetus van drie maanden
548813 net als de christenunie vinden veel zittende cda politici dat bussemaker te ver gaat
548814 de christenunie laat een arrogante zelfvoldaanheid zien als we op het terrein komen van leven en dood de politici van die partij meent dat zij als zeer gelovige christenen de wijsheid in pacht hebben het is het willen opleggen van een opvatting die berust op een levensovertuiging de christenunie gebruikt de tweede kamer als missiepost maar daar is het parlement niet voor dan moet je het zendingswerk in gaan in het parlement dien je elkaar te overtuigen met argumenten

548846 the start is the critical area for me its vital because that is what i do i go from the start and win my races from there
548847 other riders though who dont have a good a start will be very good technically which will help them go from sixth to second
548848 i did track cycling to prove that bmx cyclists werent just people on kids bikes and to show that we are athletes
548849 i think its great to get as high as that
548850 at the beginning of the year a lot of people were asking me if my new setup after splitting with
548851 i think my results showed that it took a little bit of time but that its paying off and im enjoying myself much more on court
548852 im much calmer and obviously my results have got better and better as the years gone on
548853 hes obviously got a great serve but ive read it well in the past today i did the same
548854 youve still got to come up with passes because he volleys well
548855 i hit some great lobs and passing shots which is why i managed to break him so many times four
548856 he is a top player who will want to prove himself in every game i feel our fans are behind him i feel that was more disappointed love
548857 to me face to face he always told me he wants to stay at the club and it finished like that so i believe what he told me
548858 he is not going anywhere even if you come with a 747 plane full of money
548859 experience wise we are a bit short in midfield but we will see with diaby not being injured denilson being available we have quality in there
548860 we are not close to signing anybody and i will focus on the players i have if we can find someone then we will do it if not i am happy as well
548861 last year we were really really unlucky we were only four points adrift and lost only three games
548862 in two of those we were leading 1 0 until 15 minutes before the end we also got some bad injuries

548866 we view this as a great opportunity to not only honor our local everyday heroes but to celebrate the courage of the passengers and crew members of flight 93

548889 i dont think we will know about this arsenal team this season until they lose thats the important time when you look to see how a team reacts it is how you bounce back
548890 last season was much different when we were 1 0 down and the other team was playing better than us it was really difficult for us to come back now we are patient and when we have the chance to score we do it and thats good
548891 did it ever seem to you that you needed a friend

548911 pickens has gamed texas for his own ends and now hes trying to game the rest of us too
548912 embrace wind power to help break our addiction to foreign oil
548913 pickens has obtained the right of eminent domain like he was a big city its supposed to be for the public good not a private company
548914 the source of drinking water and irrigation for plains residents from nebraska to texas the ogallala aquifer is one of the worlds largest as well as one of the most rapidly dissipating if current irrigation practices continue agribusiness will deplete the ogallala aquifer in the next century
548915 i am left asking myself why the green media have neglected the water aspect of pickens wind farm plans have we been so distracted by the prospect of texas renewable energy portfolio growing by 4000 megawatts that we are willing to overlook some potentially dodgy aspects to the project

548936 it was an image that back in high school i knew would happen someday
548937 its not a lot of fun to be grist in the hate machine which both you and i have been
548938 ive realized and accepted that if people decide to dislike me theyre going to find reasons to justify disliking me theres nothing i can do about that that said it still does pain me to be accused of fictional crimes against innocents or to be implicated in romantic gossip involving the possibly reality challenged however unreliable the source or outlandish the accusations in the end however i know that i have never done or even meant anyone any harm
548939 we never approached this with the idea of breaking the bank and treating it as an unrestricted situation because it isnt

548949 it is much safer to ride a motorcycle with a helmet
548950 decreasing the number of motorcycle fatalities in south carolina is dependent on the state passing a universal helmet law
548951 a motorcycle helmet is not going to save your life
548952 it depends on the impact you receive like if you happened to hit the back of your head the side of your head or the front of your head
548953 but if you hit the back of your neck and youre wearing a helmet the impact will bust your spinal cord
548954 if you hit a rock at 60 or 70 mph itll go straight through your skull if youre not wearing a helmet
548955 authorities should look into exactly what they died of instead just saying if they were or were not wearing a helmet
548956 during the first exercises that we do the motorcycles are never started
548957 we teach all our students the principles of shifting stopping turning and where to look riders are taught to look evaluate the situation and execute what they decide to do
548958 they decide to go buy a motorcycle and they havent rode since they were in their 20s
548959 they are used to balancing a 400 pound bike when the newer bikes are 700 or 1 200 pounds

548973 he asked that his privacy and that of his family is respected while he gets well
548974 whether its modeling clay dolls or crayons a small number of people can be counted on to use it for something vulgar
548975 rather than putting players in the shoes of luke skywalker or frodo baggins were giving them the opportunity to be george lucas or peter jackson as they create their own universe from scratch
548976 it came up simply as something silly and juvenile to do
548977 i admit it is silly and juvenile but i dont think theres anything perverted vile or awful about it if people find it offensive they can simply not search for it online no one is forcing anyone to see this content
548978 i consider this very similar to child pornography at least to the extent of distributing the material to children
548979 user created content gives players total control over their game experience and empowers them to express their creativity in ways that they never thought possible
548980 it also gives them a powerful emotional connection to the game since theyve created the world from scratch
548981 my initial reaction to discovering it in my final game would be to ban it so it wouldnt show up again and then blow it to pieces for the sheer satisfaction of it

549001 the perpetrators of this crime do not share this communitys sense of non violent behaviour and tolerance of all people from every walk of life
549002 there appear to have been racial overtones and that makes this incident something that needs to be addressed

549029 i do believe the people there will not forget that sen obama stood in the way of having their vote counted

549068 as one of the few level 3 director who actaully answers his phone when it rings i get alot of questions about coastal vacations from people who are considering the membership and from people who are looking to make coastal vacations their homebased business
549069 there are no dumb questions im open to answer any questions about coastal vacations and i do not hold back
549070 im not going to blow any smoke and offer you a bunch of bs seminars and cds that arent worth the disk they are on like other coastal vacations directors might do coastal vacations business i have an process that i use that provides information to potential business partners and that process also allows me to find people who are coachable trainable and dependable im looking for people who have the same spirit i have they must have a positive attitude they must be dead serious to changing their lives and they must be committed to sharing and giving to others
549071 the internet can be a confusing place i give my team the recipe for success with one on one customized training to each team member and i do not charge them an arm and a leg for internet tools

549080 im on my way up there and you and i will figure this out when i get there
549081 now im really upset now they are tearing down my character heres were it gets good im a sunday school teacher i would never curse what if that got out they are lying
549082 you look well for a man who only sees half the battle judging by your victory i presume they deferred to your nobility and only came at you from your good side
549083 always good to be kicked when im down modred weve beaten back the rebels following that self proclaimed bandit king regnier fewer come every year very soon well be able to ride into his fortress and put an end to all this civil war
549084 no im quite sure you can its the idea of war being civil you have acquired a taste for it in the lone and level sands leaving it behind may be harder for your people than you expect
549085 dont think i missed your correction modred is the idea of working for me so terrible i have need of a new general
549086 is my coin not as good as that of prince lucien or perhaps its because i wont bed you like karmilla does
549087 i enjoy being a mercenary tiberias it gives me advantage
549088 it gives you the advantage of living day to day not knowing where youll sleep or when youll eat it gives you the advantage of having no home or property to call your own you would not have me believe that you enjoy the uncertainty modred that is the way of paupers and beggars and we both know youre far more than that
549089 your sword is a path to privilege ive never seen some one so ignorant of their potential as you
549090 we dont all aspire to be kings tiberias and the advantage i speak of is perspective where your men have no choice but to fight for you as knighted men must i can pick my battles
549091 i know that i want your battles to be under my banner
549092 not all civil wars in karand are as black and white as this one tiberias i remember a time when the peasants rallied against your crown they would not have a king and title in these barren lands for fear of losing personal freedom
549093 that may be modred but i have delivered them we have trade again and thriving cities where once people huddled together in cottages struggling against bandits in fair weather and nearly starving to death in the first snows
549094 that is true but your deliverance came at the cost of many peasant lives and they were right they did lose many personal freedoms for order to take hold as i said your people are prone to violence regnier swells his ranks easily with the disquieted from within your great kingdom i think it is a miracle peace exists out here at all
549095 and you said you werent political what is your point modred
549096 my point is tiberias that no man should suffer tyrants and attaching yourself to any man leaves you open to that fate
549097 no one wants to become a tyrant but then the act becomes convenient
549098 because implementation takes place in a fluid setting implementation problems are never solved rather they evolve new issues new requirements new considerations emerge as the process unfolds
549099 when the gps changes grade levels such as earth and physical science trading what year they are taught everyone is thrown into an uproar and teacher shuffling happens and book shuffling happens

549101 it is time to stop teaching the kids we wish we had and start teaching the kids we do have
549102 one of our teachers spoke up with a quote that is shared nationwide about what we had to do to address our students needs
549103 it is time to stop teaching the kids we wish we had and start teaching the kids we do have
549104 that would require me to have extra plans in place
549105 would have gone with the higher level textbook for the curriculum the teacher should be able to adjust the information to fit the needs of their students by not choosing the higher end book the students will not get exposed to certain high order thinking skills
549106 how does the day of a kind who is meeting grade level expectations look like a kind who is not meeting expectations

549114 the process of curing is passive that is the patient is inclined to give his or her authority over to the physician and prescribed treatment instead of actively challenging the illness and reclaiming health healing on the other hand is an active and internal process that includes investigating ones attitudes memories and beliefs with the desire to release all negative patterns that prevents ones full emotional and spiritual recovery
549115 i was telling my friend that it seemed to me that medicine had become a killing machine its major purpose seemed to be a war on disease the focus is on killing bacteria eradicating aids eliminating cancer controlling diabetes etc if we are going to do this killing we need ammunition and the ammunition in the field of medicine is primarily drugs
549116 our focus needs to change from killing to helping enhance the life process of each individual if we do this were going to need living materials such as living air living earth living water and living food

549131 jeremy xido and claudia heu from cabula6 both from a theatrical background examined in their project crime that took place in berlin the so called honor killing of the young german turkish womanhatun s r c
549132 the interest in crime in exceptional situations is universal and in single cases allows typical insights into the local environment the six projects were very precisely and typically selected were viewed in the local environment and thus told a lot about the respective cities in salzburg one cannot avoid depicting the intact front of the tourist and mozart city as a typical surface this reality was accompanied by descriptions of hardly visible problems like homelessness and juvenile delinquency the film achieved great authenticity through the interview partners very personal narrations and its unpretentious un commentating artistic form it brought concealed people into the light and illuminated the dark sides of the baroque metropolis the process of creation as well as the films showings brought different people together in conversation homeless people adolescents people directly concerned artists and those interested in art
549133 the subject that jeremy xido and claudia heu cabula6 chose crime initiated a discussion and debate about the meaning of the expression crime what is a crime is it a tragic event does an unsolved thriller still cause tension or is is a factory that pervades a territory so we proposed to xido heu to focus on the solvay factory a large industry that gave the name to the small town born around it rosignano solvay to create this performance we calibrated a way to interact with the territory because solvay is always a point of conflict and we did not want to give the impression that cabula6s work was a sensational report or an environmental denunciation we wanted to protect the artistic sensibility and the value of the artistic creation in the same way posing is important for painting or acting is important for dance or theater performance the response was amazing people spontaneously chose to take part in the research by participating offering photos and testimonials the result was a heated debate at the solvay workers social club where politicians chemists and workers freely expressed their opinions in this way apap due to cabula6 project offered a beautiful agora of democratic exchange and this in such a small place not generally interested in the performing arts is no small thing i am interested in talking about crime because it dealt in my opinion with the deepest meaning of apap to find the connections between an artistic creation and the socio cultural framework of where it is presented
549134 pouyan stop dis pull out before its too late youll become lyk me and never give up its not the way
549135 wot your jealous dat ive made it bigger then u your jealous that u taught me things and i became better and found new things to do and made it further in the ranks then you i never thought u would hate on me but its true in this business no ones friends their associates
549136 why did you choose the form of documentation to portrait cities through crime cases your background is performing arts so this was not your own media
549137 so this project allowed you to try out a new form a new genre for you will you continue to make documentary films
549138 how close did you get into the different communities and was it helpful to be a total outsider
549139 how can it be if someone is born and raised here that he or she is not considered german
549140 if the protagonists of this case were born and raised here in berlin doesnt this make the case a german case or at least a berlin case and not a turkish one
549141 do you think that your artistic view on the cases opened new perspectives for the people involved or have you experienced this
549142 this thing that you live with and dont see anymore is also important of value existent and affects your life and your concept of your self
549143 how did the availability of six cities influence the project how much more is a serial result a better artistic experience
549144 saw their own impotence in the face of the other and destroyed it
549145 were these young people from here from germany or were they foreigners
549146 people like to say that it isnt us doing these crimes but in a global world this is a false satisfaction it is us it is the old europe thats using the new europe to do its dirty work
549147 is there anything you would like to mention that was influential unique socially and artistically special in this project

549171 removing this record is the right thing to do pure and simple
549172 we have no interest in a record that the facts not rumors have exposed as being achieved by fraudulent means by at least one athlete on the team obviously tyree washington and michael johnson played no part in the doping activities of others and it is a shame that they may suffer as a result but our message is clear compete clean win clean and break records clean or get out of our sport and out of our record books
549173 the lapel pin question is a staple of american politics this or allegiance to the flag always comes up ridiculous but youd be surprised how many people care about it
549174 the main concern about him is that he doesnt actually seem to aspire to anything outside of the washington power structure and doesnt seem to be interested in challenging the status quo in any fundamental way movements are killed by false prophets cults of personality and by the unwillingness of those in the movement to wield their power for their agenda however the admission that barack obama has to hustle now to create accomplishments as a way to run for president rather than him running for president as a way to nationalize accomplishments hes already achieved or merely tried to achieve is really a sad commentary on the substance free nature of american politics today
549175 the minute you mention sexism or feminism or anything related to gender as a stand alone topic a large number not all okay of obama supporters immediately go into a what appears to be a defensive crouch
549176 well look wolf i think if you watch how we have conducted our campaign weve been very measured in terms of how we talk about senator clinton i have been careful to say that i think that senator clinton is a capable person and that should she win the nomination obviously i would support her you know im not sure that we have been getting that same approach from the clinton campaign

549183 look i make between 2 000 and 3 000 a month it costs between 1 600 and 1 800 for a motel at 50 60 a night for a cheap one in a suburb like fremont you can do that but youre not saving anything to get out of this

549213 i dont think its negative i think were drawing differences between us
549214 i responded to it because im disappointed and i dont want that issue to be part of this campaign

549225 a mirror image of earlier debates in which two nbc moderators tim russert and brian williams repeatedly pressed mrs clinton with tough and provocative questions
549226 obama had a nightmare night if senator obama had been subjected to the scrutiny that hillary clinton has been subjected to he would have turned to ash by now
549227 really have you seen their eyes its this faraway look its scary
549228 with straight white male progressive friends i feel something that makes me viscerally angry and afraid the viciousness of the rebuttals to the suggestion that obamas and clintons policies are roughly equal or that clintons have some benefits to them the outright dismissal of any support of her the impossibility of having a nuanced conversation the whole hillary clinton is a monster theme is so virulent
549229 i dont think anyone in my peer group including my parents and my friends would be comfortable saying im not ready for a woman president they would be ostracized saying shes had plastic surgery or her attitude is off putting are fine but these are really expressions of some deeper issues with the fact that shes a woman
549230 hillary clinton is not an attractive personality for a lot of people
549231 very convenient that the same people who have a sense of discomfort with female authority they prefer not to examine
549232 is the energy of the first expressed in words of the second
549233 ive never heard them say anything where i could say thats a sexist comment its just that i cant understand why they hate her so much i just have a feeling that they wouldnt be as bothered by her if she were a man but thats very intuitive i think some of the guys just have some kind of visceral dislike for her
549234 people can always come up with reasons they dont like the candidate theyre not supporting
549235 but no one disliked joe biden or chris dodd as much as they dislike hillary
549236 my friends or boyfriend or father are progressive guys but when they talk about hillary i feel like theyre being sexist but i cant put my finger on what it is
549237 because their friends were not being specifically sexist or saying something that was tangibly misogynistic they were having a hard time talking about the sexism of it
549238 i spoke to a guy friend who said youre being ridiculous im not not voting for her because shes a woman im not voting for her because shes a bitch he could not see the connection between the two things at all
549239 i mean a bitch in the sense that shes not good on this or that issue
549240 someone will feel its ok to say something to me thats anti hillary that i feel is coming from a place thats totally misogynist the same thing happens if i say something thats pro hillary someone will launch into an anti hillary diatribe that doesnt have anything to do with her as a politician but because its not explicit sexism it makes it impossible to argue with people because if you say something then youre the wackadoo feminist
549241 sexism does not have to be 100 percent of whats going on it might not even be 80 percent but give me a break its there dont say that its not there
549242 you would hope that people would at least realize that thats what theyre saying but they cant its like they dont have the vocabulary because theyre so adamantly not acknowledging that thats going on theyre busy patting themselves on the back for supporting a black man arent we cool
549243 i have not talked with any straight men on campus who are voting for hillary and a lot of the females i know are supporting obama i dont know if thats because they actually do support him or if its because they dont want to be attacked because theyre female and theyre leaning toward hillary
549244 i feel like the kids who are for obama are much more into marketing and bragging about it hillary people are not so much into advertising it yet
549245 the only political item was a huge stack of hillary nutcrackers
549246 obviously the play here is that shes a ball buster no one is making nutcracker icons of mccain or obama
549247 i felt like im a woman and id love to have a woman president but i also have many other issues i care about and the iraq war is a big one and im not going to make my decision just because im a woman
549248 there has been a lot of anger toward hillary thats felt really intense and misogynistic the gloating after iowa was something to behold and its made me realize we are still dealing with the gender issue i dont think we know what to make of women in power or make of hillary i dont think the world is as postfeminist as i was feeling that it was

549255 they are bitter because no political leader truly understands the false of the systems resulting in the undeserved economic struggles and it is partly due to the lack of ability of democrats to present the policies that address their needs
549256 that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding that ye might walk worthy of the lord unto all pleasing being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of god
549257 and he said unto them come ye yourselves apart into a desert place and rest a while
549258 has the father led you into the desert has he plucked from under your feet all that you depended upon then a glorious experience is yours see if this be not a way whereby god will glorify you do not complain about what you have lost and do not yearn to have it back again for then you are like israel who wished to turn back to egypt god leads on and instead of the flesh pots he gives you bread from heaven and instead of water from the nile water from the rock but you must put your trust in him also in the desert and through the days of darkness and difficulty this is possible however only for those who have lost their self assurance in the desert whereto god beckons his children
549259 are there sorrows that sorely test our hearts be assured that our father intends every one of them to be a road for us to christ so that we may reach him and know him in some character of his love and power that otherwise our souls had not known
549260 and they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them

549272 given the iranian nuclear standoff syria attaches great importance to international treaties directly related to the issue as to international accords iran has the right to enrich uranium and to operate a nuclear plant like any other state

549285 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
549286 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
549287 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
549288 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
549289 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
549290 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
549291 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
549292 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
549293 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
549294 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
549295 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
549296 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
549297 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
549298 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
549299 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
549300 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
549301 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
549302 going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills

549327 a generally accepted agreement had been developed between gangs nationally that whanau homes would not be targeted like this and how that understanding had more or less held good for well over a decade
549328 new zealand youth gangs timeline 1800s gangs comprised of pakeha sealers and whalers create mayhem authorities are concerned about a maori backlash and so form the nz police to curb pakeha gangs
549329 however similarly the indiscriminate spraying of political bullets is an equally terrifying reality in the name of getting gangs under control we seem to be hell bent on making fundamental changes to our criminal justice system we are contemplating the extinction of personal rights that have sat in place in english law since the magna carta the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty indeed further the suggestion of terrorism legislation intimates a suspension of habeas corpus just as we dont want to see our kids killed by a drive by bullet we surely dont want them to live in a society where these fundamental rights do not exist where the shortcut rules intended to deal with one manifestation of a problem produce unintended consequences and now its your kids or grandkids who arise as the social devils of the day and are subject to whatever eventuates in legislation legislation is significant but how we use it is even more so if drive bys are indiscriminate how we apply criminal legislation is very discriminate this is reflected in the racial profile of our prison and gang populations what we really mean when we talk about gang is maori gang we arent talking about organised crime at all if we were talking about organised crime we would be talking about the big hitters the internationals the dudes that are hard to catch they might not even look like our caricature of a gang member but no we are fixated on hori and hemi at the mall with leathers and moko i think we pakeha actually suffer some sort of settler malaise at this point and we run a fever do we have some suppressed memory and unresolved fear of the natives

549375 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
549376 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
549377 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
549378 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
549379 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
549380 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
549381 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
549382 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing

549384 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
549385 tao is great heaven is great earth is great the king is also great
549386 one can share in the commodities and values of life only if one has successfully marketed ones own labour
549387 capitalist systems do not operate in order to provide employment their guiding principle is the pursuit of profitability if profitability results in high employment that is a happy coincidence for those who want jobs if it does not bottom line oriented companies will not take it upon themselves to hire those their plans have left behind
549388 the more unlikely it becomes that every adult will be able to find and keep a secure satisfying and well paying job the more frantic and aggressive the competition becomes between generations sexes ethnic groups for this supreme good
549389 indian outsourcing companies are shifting some of their operations to china the philippines vietnam and kenya in a bid to stay competitive as higher wages expensive property prices and a rising rupee eat into profits
549390 the united nations estimates human development report 1997 8 that the additional cost of achieving and maintaining universal access to basic education for all basic health care for all reproductive health care for all women adequate food for all and safe water and sanitation for all is roughly 40 billion a year that is a lot of money but it is just 4 percent of the combined wealth of the worlds richest 225 individuals
549391 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
549392 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
549393 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
549394 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
549395 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
549396 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
549397 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
549398 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
549399 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
549400 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
549401 well what about your new blog asking black feminist 10 questions
549402 and of course if we do not hear does not mean that these conversations are not happening
549403 but for maori as a partner to te tiriti o waitangi there is absolutely nothing
549404 i do very much agree that newcomers to new zealand need to be introduced in a friendly way to the treaty and maori culture
549405 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
549406 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
549407 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
549408 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
549409 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
549410 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
549411 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
549412 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
549413 the chinese have since the 1860s been the largest non european and non polynesian ethnic group in new zealand
549414 to study the chinese in this country therefore is also to examine in depth new zealands race relations and notions of national identity
549415 contemporary new zealand has an image of itself as an egalitarian fair and classless society
549416 since the early 1990s new zealand society has witnessed the revival of waves of racism against the chinese especially new immigrants
549417 at the same time there has been genuine puzzlement and much soulsearching among thinking new zealanders at the prevalence of simplistic anti immigration sloganeering
549418 the unwillingness to admit the chinese as part of the nations legitimate history and future indicates new zealands persistent indulgence in an anachronistic dream still imagining that it is a european instead of an asian amp pacific nation i believe that the process of finding out who the chinese are and where they should fit within the new zealand cultural and ethnic mosaic will greatly contribute to the nations self knowledge and foster the positive development of new zealands own national identity
549419 in the late nineteenth century the new zealand parliament passed discriminatory laws against chinese seeking to enter new zealand
549420 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
549421 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
549422 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
549423 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
549424 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
549425 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
549426 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
549427 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
549428 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
549429 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
549430 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
549431 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
549432 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
549433 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
549434 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
549435 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
549436 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
549437 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
549438 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
549439 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
549440 who are open to doing something on the production side
549441 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
549442 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
549443 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
549444 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
549445 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
549446 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
549447 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
549448 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
549449 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
549450 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
549451 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
549452 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
549453 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
549454 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
549455 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
549456 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
549457 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
549458 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
549459 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
549460 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
549461 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
549462 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
549463 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
549464 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
549465 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
549466 well fal what about your new blog asking black feminist 10 questions
549467 and of course if we do not hear does not mean that these conversations are not happening
549468 the dark knight es probablemente la pelicula que mejor entendio de que se trata batman y todo su universo
549469 the rules provide for a vote at the convention to seat contested delegations this goes back as long as ive been in politics it goes back to the 1940s by my memory and maybe before that
549470 there is nothing unusual about this you know i know that some of you have only covered the 04 and the 2000 campaign which were really kind of anomalies the nominees were determined early but thats not the usual pattern my husband didnt wrap up the nomination in 92 until june and usually it takes a while to sort all this out and thats why there are rules democratic party rules that if there are contested delegations the convention votes on them those are the rules
549471 in the weeks since karl rove offered his unsolicited advice on how to defeat hillary clinton in the pages of the financial times right wing expressions of support for obama have become increasingly conspicuous and voluble

549473 i am howard dean and im here to represent the democratic wing of the democratic party
549474 the problem is women of color dont even have these conversations amongst themselves
549475 i find so frustrating is that in general men of color dont really get sexism

549487 paramount importance to study the roots of terrorism and other forms of violence
549488 deeply concerned that funding such research through the pentagon may pose a potential conflict of interest
549489 elements of national power beyond the guns and steel of the military
549490 in iraq and afghanistan the heroic efforts and best intentions of our men and women in uniform have at times been undercut by a lack of knowledge of the culture and people they are dealing with every day
549491 it sets up sort of a soviet system or top down system
549492 if you look at the big picture this will not make us smarter this will make us much more narrow it will only look at problems defense wants us to in a narrow way
549493 well keep talking over the next several hours and hope to reach an agreement
549494 i dont like lacy and i dont like contraptions my favorite is my boyfriends calvin klein briefs i wear them around the house all the time
549495 both parties are talking the green bay packers and brett
549496 and i think the discussions are moving ahead i would hope that we would have something resolved by monday
549497 i think its come to the point where there need to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans
549498 primarily it starts with the fact does brett want to play football
549499 the second is do the packers want him to play for the packers those are the two principal points that have to be resolved and only two parties can make that determination not me
549500 i was interjected into it because there was a tampering charge initially
549501 im not looking for things to interject myself to its an issue that needs to be addressed because of the competing interests you want to make sure its done properly and within our rules this is an issue that ultimately has to be decided between brett and the packers
549502 whats going on between brett and the organization is something that the players and coaches we cannot handle
549503 were not involved in it i think they did a good job from a responsibility standpoint dealing with it for about two days but the focus has been on improving
549504 today was our first bump in the road in terms of having too many negative things happen in practice and i think thats a credit to their focus and their energy level and staying true to its training camp
549505 everybody is going through it and theyve done a really good job no one is really talking about it frankly
549506 deacon jones said i was gonna cry you bet im gonna cry
549507 you bet youre life im gonna cry you bet your life i will thats my boy thats my boy right there
549508 we havent looked very good for about a week now we need to win ballgames and these guys have always given us trouble the guys looked like they were in it today like everybody who put on the uniform thought it was an important game
549509 this guy was one of the best pitchers of the era he was a different pitcher then he threw harder struck out a lot more guys i enjoyed watching him as a kid but i dont necessarily enjoy facing him
549510 he feels comfortable with me and i dont have a problem with anybody
549511 youve got to understand that we have to win here we dont need to lose any more games
549512 he understands whats going on and he makes adjustments the same way im making adjustments hes a great target with great presentation he makes every pitch look like it was where i wanted to throw it even if it was a foot and a half off the target hes just a natural at catching
549513 we did what were supposed to do score some runs
549514 of course we do have power but weve been scoring a lot of runs with doubles and singles especially balls in the gap thats the way that we start rallies we dont usually start rallies with homers
549515 it almost felt like my first appearance of the year
549516 ive been off three months but everything felt good my foots fine the arm felt good and its good to get a win

549531 if hillary had been president she would not have started the war in fact hillary is backed by prominent anti war leaders because they believe she is uniquely able to end the war responsibly
549532 i think its our cultures that allow it to happen
549533 sacrifice of personal freedom and autonomy they felt responsible for the reputation of their families in india were eager not to compromise their families honor with a divorce and operated under the added pressure of preserving traditions and presenting an
549534 i personally believe that u s americans are unable to do so because some people out there in our nation dont have maps and i believe that our education like such as in south africa and iraq and everywhere like such as and i believe that they should our education over here in the u s should help the u s or should help south africa and should help iraq and the asian countries so we will be able to build up our future for us

549545 nos vamos hago una caravana a las personas que estoy echando ya tanto de menos y digo adi s
549546 i think its great to get as high as that
549547 at the beginning of the year a lot of people were asking me if my new setup after splitting with coach brad gilbert was going to work and questioning if it was the right thing for me to do
549548 i think my results showed that it took a little bit of time but that its paying off and im enjoying myself much more on court
549549 im much calmer and obviously my results have got better and better as the years gone on
549550 hes obviously got a great serve but ive read it well in the past today i did the same
549551 youve still got to come up with passes because he volleys well
549552 i hit some great lobs and passing shots which is why i managed to break him so many times four
549553 the retreat at the parliament building will give the leaders the opportunity to have unstructured talks in an informal atmosphere
549554 saarc declarations are divine but the devil is in the detail
549555 we need collective action to wipe out terrorism in the region
549556 fraizer campbell has taken his goal very well and it wont do him any harm hes an aggressive young player very quick and determined and he can do well
549557 his future lies here because dont have any strikers we only have wayne rooney and carlos tevez so fraizer comes into that area
549558 we are also hoping to apply for a work permit for manucho who comes from angola that will give us more back up
549559 carrick and rooney have been struggling with a virus for a few days and they wont be fit for the juventus game on wednesday hopefully they will be ready for the communtiy shield game
549560 other than that gary neville had a calf strain but hell be ok for wednesday
549561 i have had more than a year to get used to not playing but it doesnt get any easier and i knew this would be my last game at old trafford
549562 it has been a great day for me and my family though the 20 minutes that i played towards the end of the game are something i will never forget
549563 i cant wait to run out at arsenal wearing a spurs shirt
549564 in fact ive not been sleeping at the moment just thinking about running out there
549565 ive always wanted to play in a north london derby it will brilliant i know its coming up on october 29
549566 what id love to do is go there and score the winner against them that would be excellent
549567 i know ill cop a bit of abuse from their fans but thats what people go and watch football for ill enjoy that
549568 you dont want a boring life as a footballer you want it to be entertaining and things like that will inspire me if you dont get a buzz off that well
549569 you know how it works life isnt perfect all the time
549570 i played for the arse as you call it i grew up playing with a lot of talented kids but my heart is at tottenham im a tottenham boy im happy
549571 there will be a vigorous assessment made by the spfs director of operations to do an evacuation
549572 then a message will be displayed at the parade area together with a voice message to urge the public to stay calm and at the same time to evacuate orderly following the instructions of the ushers as well as the officers at the scene to a safe location
549573 at the same time we will activate the contingency forces to do the rescue work and implement necessary measures to restore normalcy
549574 we are strategically located at the vicinity of the parade area and we can respond within a moments notice
549575 over and above this we have been working with the police and saf singapore armed forces organisers planning for any contingency looking at areas where we can gel our responses and synergise our efforts
549576 both players showed good movement and so did steven gerrard
549577 dirk kuyt and yossi benayoun were coming inside so i felt we had five offensive players very clever and with quality so we were a threat all the time
549578 keane is very clever and he worked hard he is very happy here and hopefully we will see a lot of good movement and also goals from him
549579 gerrard torres and keane playing together was one of the keys to keeping possession
549580 but i feel we have some good players in the team different players with different qualities and a good mentality
549581 the first half was okay but in the second half they needed to go forward in front of their supporters
549582 we had more space and we scored the second goal on the counter attack
549583 but from the start of the game we wanted to impress and we wanted to win
549584 we worked hard had plenty of possession and wanted to keep a high tempo with the ball
549585 we scored once and had one or two problems near the end of the first half but we controlled it
549586 we do not have any strikers apart from wayne rooney and carlos tevez and frazier plays in that area
549587 he took his goal really well and that wont do him any harm
549588 we had a meeting last monday with gareth and his agent at which we all agreed we would have a 5pm deadline on wednesday and if liverpool had not proved they had the wherewithal to proceed with the transfer then we would all leave that aside and go on with it
549589 i was hoping that would be the case and this was not a matter of liverpool missing a deadline by 15 minutes as seems to have been reported
549590 liverpool first showed their interest in signing gareth barry almost four months ago so this is not a case of missing the deadline by 15 minutes thats simply not true
549591 the following morning we were upbeat on the strength of what had happened on wednesday evening we were very buoyant and optimistic that everything could come back to normal again
549592 that wasnt to be though on thursday there was a meeting between gareths agent myself and the player
549593 they still felt that even though the deadline had passed they still felt liverpool were going to come in and do the deal
549594 obviously i was disappointed to hear that gareths head is a bit all over the place at the moment and they asked for some more time
549595 i listened to what theyve said and ill go with it reluctantly but ill go with it
549596 there will be no deadline and liverpool have all the time in the world now to sign gareth barry theyve got up to the normal window which is the 31st of this month
549597 i have a football club to run and i really do want people who want to play for us
549598 really it is up to them gareth and his agent to sort it out ive decided this is the only way forward for us really
549599 if liverpool at their end of it all do not come up with the money thats no one elses fault but their own
549600 id be delighted if that was the case and gareth stayed but i would doubt that very much the ball is very much in their court
549601 it seems they can find money for another player who wasnt in the equation certainly four months ago and certainly two months ago
549602 seemed to delight in inflicting punishment the basement was a chamber of horrors to the youngsters who were regaled by the older children with tales of terrible whippings which the yells and entreaties which sometimes floated up from the lower regions clinched in their minds
549603 the principal is recovering from a sprained ankle which is said to be the sequel of an earlier incident when an older girl whom he attempted to punish pushed him down a flight of stairs
549604 should a teacher have occasion to administer corporal punishment she is hereby directed to do it in the presence of her principal and with the rubber tube provided for the purpose should a principal have occasion to administer corporal punishment she is hereby directed to do it in the presence of another teacher of her building and with the rubber tube provided for the purpose
549605 in the future no corporal punishment shall be inflicted on any pupil attending the schools of this district unless the approval of the superintendent of schools and the district is first obtained and the superintendent is present when the punishment is administered

549617 i like what that donna darko commenter says i feel like somehow ive seen her writing elsewhere too
549618 my friend started asserting that hillarys probably going to win and that shes tremendously experienced and qualified and i kind of just lost my shit
549619 watching the results come in of the new hampshire primary i was despondent and my wife was overjoyed
549620 she really thinks hes a cheap huckster and i think that clinton is a cold fish manipulator
549621 she might be seen as a phallic woman because she needs to be strong and to stand up for herself and obviously to stand up for everyone else that can be very threatening to some men and when men feel threatened sometimes they worry about being castrated
549622 acceptance of or refusal to deal with inherent issues of gender inequality

549624 un ngel del se or habl a felipe diciendo lev ntate y ve hacia el sur por el camino que desciende de jerusal n a gaza el cual es desierto entonces l se levant y fue y sucedi que un et ope eunuco funcionario de candace reina de los et opes el cual estaba sobre todos sus tesoros y hab a venido a jerusal n para adorar volv a sentado en su carro y leyendo al profeta isa as y el esp ritu dijo a felipe ac rcate y j ntate a ese carro acudiendo felipe le oy que le a al profeta isa as y dijo pero entiendes lo que lees el dijo y c mo podr si alguno no me ense are y rog a felipe que subiese y se sentara con l el pasaje de la escritura que le a era este como oveja a la muerte fue llevado y como cordero mudo delante del que lo trasquila as no abri su boca en su humillaci n no se le hizo justicia mas su generaci n qui n la contar porque fue quitada de la tierra su vida respondiendo el eunuco dijo a felipe te ruego que me digas de qui n dice el profeta esto de s mismo o de alg n otro entonces felipe abriendo su boca y comenzando desde esta escritura le anunci el evangelio de jes s y yendo por el camino llegaron a cierta agua y dijo el eunuco aqu hay agua qu impide que yo sea bautizado felipe dijo si crees de todo coraz n bien puedes y respondiendo dijo creo que jesucristo es el hijo de dios y mand parar el carro y descendieron ambos al agua felipe y el eunuco y le bautiz cuando subieron del agua el esp ritu del se or arrebat a felipe y el eunuco no le vio m s y sigui gozoso su camino pero felipe se encontr en azoto y pasando anunciaba el evangelio en todas las ciudades hasta que lleg a cesarea
549625 y les dijo id por todo el mundo y predicad el evangelio a toda criatura el que creyere y fuere bautizado ser salvo mas el que no creyere ser condenado y estas se ales seguir n a los que creen en mi nombre echar n fuera demonios hablar n nuevas lenguas tomar n en las manos serpientes y si bebieren cosa mort fera no les har da o sobre los enfermos pondr n sus manos y sanar n
549626 y todos los d as en el templo y por las casas no cesaban de ense ar y predicar a jesucristo
549627 bartender id like to see about a drink and a friendly card game mind pointing me in the right direction
549628 my grandmother was a very regal woman i couldnt picture her in that role of rebellious daughter
549629 i was so intrigued i asked this relative over to ask some more questions that led me to other people from the town my grandparents came from and it became an evolving thing
549630 then my aunt who had been the family historian died it was a big loss how are we going to find things out my theory is that when people lose their connections with the past we feel like were kind of orphans so genealogy fills that
549631 some you can do online and some you cant if you want to get a birth death or marriage certificate from chicago now you might be able to get it right away
549632 provides an unparalleled opportunity for researchers from absolute beginners to professionals to learn from the fields best experts it is the place for announcements of major discoveries and projects and innovations in the jewish genealogy world and from these annual meetings the word goes out around the world
549633 perhaps the most important aspect of each conference is the personal interaction among attendees as they network with those researching the same names and towns consult with international archivists and learn together
549634 we knew who we were memories of the minneapolis jewish north side
549635 hes taking his playbook home things are starting to make a little bit more sense to him i think thats the giant step hes taking forward
549636 im just trying to enjoy it while im playing because when im 50 years old and people dont know me ill be like i kind of miss that
549637 i was at a movie and he came on doing a commercial with an astronaut suit
549638 its crazy to see him on there because he is your teammate
549639 the guy is special you have to come up with a better adjective than special ive got to look in my thesaurus or dictionary to find one he just has it
549640 theres nothing else to say thats an amazing cat i just be watching him smiling
549641 people want to make that the main focus and thats not the main focus at all
549642 i have my individual goals but my main goal is to win the division and get to the super bowl if along the way i get that it happens its going to remain 2 000 every year but its not my main focus
549643 hes a guy that sets outrageous goals and meets them and thats fine with me because hes shown he can handle that
549644 and he knows hes not going to sneak up on anybody
549645 there were some things i looked at on film last season and was like man that was crazy
549646 but there were definitely a lot of things i looked at and felt i could do a whole lot better
549647 i understand why there are people out there that think holy smokes youre crazy
549648 i just think its important for people to know we believe this is the right direction for the packers to go both now and in the future
549649 no disrespect to brett but with brett the attention is kind of always on brett
549650 without brett its more on the team if he isnt with us that gives us a better opportunity to kind of let people know that were not a fluke we arent built on just one person
549651 no matter who you are in this league a team is a team
549652 you take the guys around tom brady and peyton manning away and i dont think theyd be as successful
549653 deacon jones said i was gonna cry you bet im gonna cry
549654 you bet youre life im gonna cry you bet your life i will thats my boy thats my boy right there
549655 my dad always used to give me and my sister advice like most kids we didnt always follow that advice
549656 a piece of advice he gave me once was never make athletes your heroes because they make mistakes too i guess i didnt follow that advice very well id like to introduce you to my hero my mentor my father emmitt thomas
549657 my late grandfather is still my hero i remember those long hot summer nights sitting on the porch listening to a game or a fight
549658 he taught me about honor commitment love religion and respect
549659 it happens when youre protecting someone like john elway and what happens is the night before the game you get little or no sleep
549660 because if you didnt do your job youll forever be known as the guy who lost our franchise i would also like to thank john it was worth every sleepless night
549661 i think its important to be honest that youre pregnant
549662 im not ashamed of it but its made finding a job very difficult
549663 were young and we need a double income to have the baby pay off the mortgage and bills it all adds up
549664 i think some employers are insensitive i dont think they have any understanding of pregnant employees they need guidelines
549665 small businesses have trouble just trying to cope with someone being off on maternity leave
549666 hiring someone who is pregnant brings additional complications for them
549667 they look for who can do the job now if the person is leaving on maternity leave in a couple of months and somebody else is there rather than starting all over again they might say this new person has some advantages
549668 a lot of employers regrettably still look at this as something which is detrimental to their business
549669 this mentality of employers is very damaging and belittling to women it makes women feel that theyve done something wrong by being pregnant
549670 even with qualifications behind you businesses get nervous that youre going to leave them when i would actually feel very grateful and would want to return to work part time after the babys born
549671 this is a tax that will go through every household and every small business in australia
549672 in plain language for real australians trying to feed clothe and house children and raise families and run small businesses and survive as pensioners and carers the emission trading scheme is a tax
549673 mr rudd has a responsibility to describe how compensation is going to work
549674 plague pestilence and disease famine death drought and bleaching of the great barrier reef
549675 mr rudd is wanting australia to believe that if australia does not act then that will be the outcome
549676 the truth is if the world does not act and the science is right then that will be the scenario
549677 if this sort of impact is sustained over this calendar year theres no chance the government will get the benefit of the additional revenue it has counted on in its budget he said
549678 in an environment where the broader economic conditions appear to be deteriorating theres the risk that brands face the distasteful prospect of having to retrench staff
549679 im going to bring you back to court tomorrow and thats for an application for a forensic procedure
549680 in all my experiences there the pakistan people have been friendly and hospitable everything is absolutely first class
549681 if im selected to be an umpire i will not hesitate to go
549682 the miami zoo is awesome they seem to have keepers giving the animals treats everywhere we went
549683 we walked up to the chimp exhibit and the keeper was throwing them oranges one at a time well this guy couldnt wait he was dancing around and giving raspberries trying to get an extra one
549684 we have to be innovative and think a little outside the box
549685 the advantage is the county would be open five days a week ten hours a day
549686 oooo look indigenous kiddies are going to private schools now aint that wonderful
549687 look theres an aboriginal doctor and a phd now three of them are playing for the wallabies without going walkabout talk about progress in assimilation
549688 i assure you its only for jess to see its to show her that her fans are there for her were hoping that she would get a laugh out of it were just trying to cheer her up

549692 often when you talk to bishops it appears they dont believe in very much
549693 is this what we want in our pristine valleys of clayoquot sound
549694 i would say no i would absolutely say no so i think we have to oppose all of these projects
549695 i never go to europe i never go to the queen and tell her how to be in her territory what gives the right of any other society to come here and say that to me and my chiefs
549696 give us a chance to do what we need to do on our own
549697 this is a clearcut like the old fashioned clearcuts that everybody knew would destroy watersheds would lead to erosion would lead to the siltation in our oceans in our rivers
549698 those precious places like clayoquot sound are getting fewer and fewer
549699 before you were lucky to be in one maybe two olympics as you had to go and earn a living
549700 but now athletes can make a living through marketing and endorsements so they can extend their careers
549701 if you look at top performers in their 40s 50s and 60s the volume of training hours per day is sometimes down but they keep the intensity high they usually also do things to prevent age associated declines in muscle mass
549702 all things being equal the person who can put forth a maximum effort and at the same time relax has a real edge a lot of it is learning how to compete in a relaxed way when the pressure is on
549703 i think you guys kicked some serious booty read more win a trip to the dress rehearsals
549704 if youre watching these special features you must be one of the hundreds of people who saw zoolander in a theater
549705 only a juristic figment of the imagination lacking both a body to be kicked and a soul to be damned
549706 denial functions as a buffer after unexpected shocking news and allows the person time to collect himself
549707 remember that i am still a bright and articulate person with a problem that sometimes affects my ability to do certain things
549708 that the world has found all the easy to reach oil and the daily supply of the essential black goo will fall further and further behind escalating global demand
549709 there are more and more people who believe that oil supply prospects are not very optimistic said fatih birol chief economist at the paris based international energy agency
549710 still birol counts himself among those who believe the world has reached at least a peak of easily accessible oil that alone is cause for worry because many economies are built around the assumption that oil would continue to be cheap and plentiful
549711 tyson slocum director of the energy program at public citizen a washington based consumer group doesnt care when the peak will come
549712 im just really waiting for him to get close to a sideline workout
549713 hes the one who has to go through this process of playing catch building up arm strength and all those things and ill put him in my mind more prominently when its the day before a sideline
549714 i have no taxes in jefferson colonel sartoris explained it to me perhaps one of you can gain access to the city records and satisfy yourselves
549715 but we have we are the city authorities miss emily didnt you get a notice from the sheriff signed by him
549716 perhaps he considers himself the sheriff i have no taxes in jefferson
549717 but there is nothing on the books to show that you see we must go by the
549718 just as if a man any man could keep a kitchen properly
549719 but what will you have me do about it madam
549720 its probably just a snake or a rat that nigger of hers killed in the yard ill speak to him about it
549721 we really must do something about it judge id be the last one in the world to bother miss emily but weve got to do something
549722 send her word to have her place cleaned up give her a certain time to do it in and if she dont
549723 will you accuse a lady to her face of smelling bad
549724 of course a grierson would not think seriously of a northerner a day laborer
549725 i want the best you have i dont care what kind
549726 if thats what you want but the law requires you to tell what you are going to use it for
549727 i dont think its any worse than its been for the last five weeks
549728 i told them i want to play so i think i might get some type of injection in the next couple of days or something
549729 it only bothers me to run so i really cant say its affected me swinging or affected me throwing
549730 im just kind of hoping it goes away but it really hasnt its something that hinders me in one aspect of the game but fortunately its not a major aspect of the game for me i think we can live
549731 the athletics have a couple of lefties going saturday and today and i think hed like to try and play these next couple of days and if we need to give him a day off maybe monday well see how he does
549732 palm centro has the power of a broadband smartphone at the price of a standard 12 key phone
549733 because of movies like mel gibsons apocalypto and this summers indian jones movie the publics interest in the mayan culture and ancient civilization has increased like never before
549734 we are happy to announce that our sister resort journeys end resort can now provide these quality tours to all the residents and guests of las terrazas
549735 with photoshop elements im able to capture memories that are very special to me in my life and create beautiful works of art
549736 this is a real bitter blow i think we have got to sit down and reassess
549737 were not playing the type of cricket we would like
549738 i think we can learn from the way south africa play a lot of us are not playing to the standards we have set
549739 i have got no doubts about my captaincy but im not scoring runs if you dont score runs it doesnt matter what position you bat
549740 this is positioned as an annual event which will bring long term benefits
549741 i was born in africa but there was a sri lankan neighbor next to us and my parents named me after her
549742 looking at other markets we find entertainment coupled with local culture as the key reason for people to go to these destinations
549743 so the hikkaduwa beach festival is one step in a long journey to get the youth market back to sri lanka
549744 there was the idea that the youth market is not lucrative they dont spend
549745 but now we call them flashpackers they like to flash their money to spend
549746 its an emerging market especially indians who have high disposable income we have lost this market
549747 sri lanka has rarely catered to the needs of this age group with little or nothing happening in the way of entertainment
549748 through events like this hikkaduwa can get rejuvenated and people will again begin to look back at hikkaduwa
549749 we believe that hikkaduwa will need a re engineering of a sort as a destination
549750 this year we are looking at the festival as a take off more importantly hikkaduwa will be getting a flavor as the carnival in rio
549751 our goal in saarc is to create new opportunities and to promote linkages for attaining better living standards for our people
549752 despite safta non tariff and para tariff barriers complicated and cumbersome customs procedures stand in the way of greater intra regional trade
549753 similarly long sensitive lists closed to preferential tariff and rigidities in other structural and policy frameworks stand in the way of our desire to have a fully integrated south asia
549754 clearly there is a need to remove these hurdles to enhance intra regional trade
549755 the imperatives of economic co operation and free trade in a highly globalised and interdependent world cannot be over emphasized
549756 recognizing that the furtherance of intra regional trade is the key to promoting and encouraging an environment of innovation healthy competition and enterprise that will stimulate economic growth create gainful employment and generate high income for our peoples we have created safta
549757 but for this instrument to be meaningful the number of items on the negative list must be reduced non tariff barriers removed and the trade facilitation measures implemented
549758 at the same time liberalization of trade in services and investments must also be perused in earnest
549759 although the numbers of mobile phone users in south asia are rapidly increasing yet our people remain distanced through the barrier of tariffs
549760 i therefore propose that we actively promote a reduced tariff for idd international direct dialing calls within the south asian region to bring our people much closer much sooner
549761 given the right kind of environment and confidence the potential for increased intra regional investment is huge
549762 i feel that a restrictive investment regime is one of the inhibiting factors in attracting foreign direct investment
549763 in this context it is important that the draft agreement on promotion and protection of investments in finalised at the earliest
549764 ego abre la puerta sale de casa y camina por la calle

549769 there was a hell of a bang the tunnel housing the machine filled with helium and dust and we had to call in the fire brigade to evacuate the place
549770 the people working on the test were frightened to death but they were all in a safe place so no one was hurt

549772 where does it say ive got to drop what im doing and answer the phone every time it rings
549773 i liked the alfred hitchcock kind of thriller aspect but the main thing i liked about it was beyond that the story was very real the story was believable because these kind of commitments or misinterpretations thereof go on all the time
549774 i doubt many people would argue against eastwoods skill on both sides of the camera its a film thats achieved cult status worldwide and was also the inspiration for the blockbuster hit fatal attraction regardless of the box office receipts this one is easily the better film as a cautionary tale on the benefits of monogamy or as a straight psycho girlfriend from hell thriller its worth your investment of time and money

549777 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
549778 were talking about the regime with the worst human rights record in the continent and the army with the worst human rights record in the continent with the greatest u s support including the contractors or mercenaries so the fact that this regime was involved in this liberation does not and should not and cannot cover up the fact that it is a horrendous regime
549779 torture massacres disappearances and killings of noncombatants are widespread and collusion between the armed forces and paramilitary groups continues to this day in 2006 u s assistance to colombia amounted to an estimated 728 million approximately 80 percent of which was military and police assistance
549780 supplied directly or through contractors troop transportation planning facilities and fuel to colombian military aircraft including the helicopter crew accused of dropping the bomb
549781 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
549782 i actually think that we should explore nuclear power as part of the energy mix
549783 the nuclear revival that we often hear about is not actually happening it is a very carefully fabricated illusion there are no buyers wall street is not putting a penny of private capital into the industry despite 100 plus percent subsidies
549784 basically we can have as many nuclear plants as congress can force the taxpayers to pay for but you wont get any in a market economy
549785 the first issue to come up for me would be the spread of nuclear weapons which it greatly facilitates if you look at places like iran and north korea how do you think theyre doing it iran claims to be making electricity vital to its development the technology materials equipment skills are applicable to both the president is absolutely right in identifying the spread of nuclear weapons as the gravest threat to our security so its really puzzling to me that hes trying to accelerate that spread every way he can think of its just an awful idea unless youre really interested in making bombs hes really triggered a new mideast arms race by trying to push nuclear power within the region
549786 about as fat a terrorist target as you can imagine it is not necessary to fly a plane into a nuclear plant or storm a plant and take over a control room in order to cause that material to be largely released you can often do it from outside the site boundary with things the terrorists would have readily available
549787 it stays dangerous for a very long time so you have to put it someplace that stays away from people and life and water for a very long time millions of years most likely so far all the places weve looked turned out to be geologically unsuitable including yucca mountain
549788 one of the big reasons we have an oil problem and a climate problem today is we spent our money on the wrong stuff if we had spent it on efficiency and renewables those problems wouldve gone away and we wouldve made trillions of dollars profit on the deal because its so much cheaper to save energy than to supply it
549789 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
549790 senator obama unequivocally opposes giving retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies and has cosponsored senator dodds efforts to remove that provision from the fisa bill granting such immunity undermines the constitutional protections americans trust the congress to protect senator obama supports a filibuster of this bill and strongly urges others to do the same
549791 wrong vote regrettable many democrats will do this we should be standing up for the constitution when sen obama is president he will im sure work to fix some of this but its going to be a lot easier to prevent it now than to try to fix it later
549792 senator obama we are a proud group of your supporters who believe in your call for hope and a new kind of politics please reject the politics of fear on national security vote against this bill and lead other democrats to do the same
549793 sometimes during campaigns the rhetoric gets overheated and amplified my core position has never changed ive always been a proponent of free trade
549794 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
549795 lone professional moralist complains to fcc which issues a declaratory order against station station goes to court
549796 if we want an improvement in radio the basic situation of broadcasting must be such that artists and thinkers have a place to work with freedom
549797 depressing inability to appreciate that in our land of cultural pluralism there are many who think act and talk differently from the members of this court and who do not share their fragile sensibilities
549798 we were founded on a very basic double standard this country was founded by slave owners who wanted to be free am i right a group of slave owners who wanted to be free so they killed a lot of white english people in order to continue owning their black african people so they could wipe out the rest of the red indian people and move west and steal the rest of the land from the brown mexican people giving them a place to take off and drop their nuclear weapons on the yellow japanese people you know what the motto of this country ought to be you give us a color well wipe it out
549799 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
549800 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
549801 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
549802 its totally prohibited to give unlimited contributions to political parties its totally prohibited for a corporation or a union to just go right into its treasury and give money to political parties yet under an exemption that was created by the federal election commission which essentially is made up of representatives of the two major parties all of this money can be given if its given through a host committee under the pretense that its merely to promote the convention city
549803 in return for this money the parties through the host committees offer access to top politicians to the president the future president vice president cabinet officials senators congressmen they promise these companies who are giving that they will be able to not only get close to these people by hosting receptions by access to vip areas but theyll actually have meetings with them
549804 lavish conventions with million dollar podiums fancy skyboxes and broadway production teams are not necessary to the democratic process
549805 congress should pass a law that says no more soft money for these conventions no corporate treasury union treasury no unlimited individual money instead the discard this host committee fiction can go out there and ask people to help the convention but with the same limits where theyre asking people to help them normally
549806 i was motionless sitting on a concrete step watching the sun shine obliquely on the pitch hearing the silence of the crowd a silence not even broken by the sobs in brutal gasps of the collective orphaning
549807 survivors of that cruel afternoon believed they would never again be able to be happy what happened on july 16 1950 deserves a collective monument like the tomb of the unknown soldier these are the things that build nations a people drenched in their own pain
549808 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
549809 temporain sont arriv es depuis quelques semaines rio de janeiro
549810 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
549811 obama represents all the promise of america that a biracial man from a broken family can rise and have a strong shot of becoming our next president
549812 im not endorsing anybody our country has elected white males from northern european countries going back now 230 or so years this finally represents that the top position in american government is really open to everyone and i think thats sending a powerful message not only to americans but throughout the world
549813 in justice inside the scandal that rocked the bush administration
549814 is when you send voter information to a group of people that you have reason to believe are no longer there such as military personnel who are overseas such as students at historically black colleges when it comes back as undeliverable the party uses that information to remove that person from the voter rolls claiming they are no longer there it is a reprehensible practice i had never heard of it until after i left office
549815 i hope the media keeps shining the spotlight on groups like the american center for voting rights which has been engaging in this type of voter suppression action especially targeting the elderly people and minorities if you are an american citizen who is not a felon you have the right to vote i would just hope that in swing states like missouri wisconsin new mexico and a handful of other states that the democratic party and the media really keep a lot of pressure on this
549816 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
549817 part of the reason is that the people who write about global warming for most newspapers and tv are not the same people as those who tend to cover weather in general the media is covering this as all sort of unconnected events just regular weather maybe gone a little wacky but in fact the scientific community has predicted for more than two decades now that as we pour more heat trapping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere the planet will heat up and that would redistribute water if you heat up the planet you evaporate more water and areas that are wetter will tend to see more intense rainfall and deluges and earlier snowmelts and all that will lead to flooding so what were seeing is exactly what scientists have been telling us would happen because of human emissions
549818 not even a few weeks before this all happened we were in the middle of doing a climate change series thats going to run over the year we had two page graphic talking about the different things that would happen in iowa as a result of climate change and pointing out that you would expect more torrential rains what has happened here is consistent with many scientists view of what global warming will mean in the midwest
549819 if a meteorologist cant speak to the fundamental science of climate change then maybe the ams american meteorological society shouldnt give them a seal of approval if a meteorologist has an ams seal of approval which is used to confer legitimacy to tv meteorologists then meteorologists have a responsibility to truly educate themselves on the science of global warming
549820 weve got to have a national mission of converting our economy and the example for the world is solar energy 4 billion years of supply it is environmentally benign decentralized makes us energy independent and replaces the exxonmobil peabody coal uranium complex that is why we have got to go for economic political health and safety reasons
549821 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
549822 old old alcoholics who could only shovel gravel but they knew songs
549823 ammon came to me one day and said youve got to be a pacifist and i said hows that he said well you act out a lot you use a lot of violent behavior and i was you know i was very angry youre not just going to lay down guns and fists and knives and hard angry words youre going to have to lay down the weapons of privilege and go into the world completely disarmed if theres one struggle that animates my life its probably that one
549824 i was a state archivist and ran a full campaign 27 counties we took 6 000 votes in utah but when it was over my job would vanish and i couldnt get work anymore in utah
549825 the trade is a fine elegant beautiful very fruitful trade in that trade i can make a living and not a killing
549826 i dont want to contribute anything to that industry i cant fault you for what youre doing i admire what you do but i cant feed that dragon think about dollars as bullets
549827 the long memory is the most radical idea in america that long memory has been taken away from us you havent gotten it in your schools youre not getting it on your television youre being leapfrogged from one crisis to the next mass media contributed to that by taking the great movements that weve been through and trivializing important events no our peoples history is like one long river it flows down from way over there and everything that those people did and everything they lived flows down to me and i can reach down and take out what i need if i have the courage to go out and ask questions
549828 the future i dont know through all of it up and down its the song its always been the song
549829 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
549830 so while it was a terrible mistake for the administration to rely on the erroneous intelligence about wmd and i mean it was catastrophic to our credibility first of all it was an honest error and not a lie but even if you correct it for that error what we found in iraq was a serious wmd threat even though saddam hussein had chosen to not maintain the stockpiles he had put himself in a position where he could have regenerated those stockpiles in three to five weeks
549831 to prove that there is nothing is almost impossible i think that if we had been in iraq for a couple of months more it would have been enough to make it extremely clear to everybody that the chances were real that there were no weapons of mass destruction
549832 i wish to heaven that they had listened a little better to what i had to say if they did listen
549833 it is hard to avoid the impression that almost 20 years after the end of the cold war military calculations still dominate the long term thinking about major global relations terrorism is formally made the chief enemy but precautions are taken against the growing power of china and russia
549834 the idea of giving enriched uranium to the saudis while threatening war with the iranians for enriching uranium is astonishing the idea that the saudis are going to somehow lower the price of oil on the basis of possibly getting nuclear reactors in the future is just almost staggering to think about
549835 then i think its very likely that the chinese who have not ratified will follow if china does it maybe india does if india does pakistan does etc and the treaty would enter into force it would be a great thing if we outlawed any nuclear weapons tests in the future
549836 to negotiate a new instrument of international humanitarian law banning cluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm to civilians
549837 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
549838 hate breeds hate the united states said they were doing this to rout out terrorism who is engaged in terrorism now
549839 im very happy to be in sudan but im very sad because of the situation of our brothers who remain in guantanamo conditions in guantanamo are very very bad and they get worse by the day our human condition our human dignity was violated and the american administration went beyond all human values all moral values all religious values in guantanamo you have animals that are called iguanas rats that are treated with more humanity but we have people from more than 50 countries that are completely deprived of all rights and privileges and they will not give them the rights that they give to animals
549840 they hold the quran in contempt destroyed it several times and put their dirty feet on it they also sat on the quran while trying to get us angry they repeatedly committed violations against our dignity and our sexual organs
549841 during these times the interrogations were all about al jazeera and alleged relations between al jazeera and al qaida they tried to induce him to spy on his colleagues at al jazeera
549842 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
549843 we are holding this demonstration because we are hungry we need to eat we need to work we are hungry thats all we are hungry
549844 the specter of widespread hunger malnutrition and social unrest on an unprecedented scale
549845 hunger is on the march here garbage is carefully sifted for whatever food might be left young babies wail in frustration seeking milk from a mother too anemic to produce it
549846 burning food today so as to serve the mobility of the rich countries is a crime against humanity
549847 the truth of the matter is its in our national interests that our farmers grow energy as opposed to us purchasing energy from parts of the world that are unstable or may not like us
549848 is this a price blip no a food shortage not that either we are in a structural meltdown the direct result of three decades of neoliberal globalization we have allowed food to be transformed from something that nourishes people and provides them with secure livelihoods into a commodity for speculation and bargaining
549849 the amount of speculative money in commodities futures was less than 5 billion in 2000 last year it ballooned to roughly 175 billion
549850 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
549851 here i am a republican thinking about nationalizing health care it just went against the grain of everything that i stood for but you have to remember i didnt come to those conclusions with lofty ideals of social justice
549852 youre seeing an ever increasing number of people starting to support a national health program in fact 59 percent of practicing physicians today believe that we need to have a national health program i mean thats unheard of even 10 years ago its amazing to see a new generation of physicians coming up who are disgusted with our current health care system you know were trained to be advocates of patients were trained to save lives were trained to practice medicine and instead what were doing is were practicing wall street economics
549853 i know a lot of people favor it but for many reasons it is difficult to achieve
549854 health care meltdown confronting the myths and fixing our failing system
549855 there are a lot of different types of single payer systems you could have purely socialized medicine thats kind of like what england has the government owns the hospitals the government owns the clinics the government finances all the health care and all the doctors work for the government that is truly socialized medicine as opposed to the canadian system where the financing comes through their medicare program but all the doctors are in private practice
549856 you know this industry is a 2 trillion industry and the profits in the for profit insurance industry are so huge and its so deeply entrenched into wall street but until we move to a single payer system and get rid of the profit motive in financing of health care we will not be able to fix the problems that we have
549857 i think that our current presidential candidates understand that ideally single payer would be the best but they dont have the political will to move that forward their job is to feel which way the wind is blowing our job is to turn that wind
549858 we never approached this with the idea of breaking the bank and treating it as an unrestricted situation because it isnt
549859 if this company really had what i call educated brains working for them they would know that their workers are the ones making them the profit
549860 i have a family to support its gonna be hard for all of us but sometimes you have to take a stand not as an individual not for the few dollars that youre gonna get out of the raise but for our families who will be working there in the future
549861 ill be number one on the line yes i will
549862 we never approached this with the idea of breaking the bank and treating it as an unrestricted situation because it isnt
549863 as to the sale of yahoo when this happened i told the team no matter what happens we will do things our own way
549864 my opinion of pat has changed over the years i used to think he was truly a man of the people but the longer he has been mayor the less i think of him as with most cities charlotte has three political parties dem rep and chamber of commerce pat is definitely the puppet of the coc here what is good for business is good for charlotte and pat very personable guy he has gotten a bunch of dems in these parts to vote for him but i dont trust him
549865 deacon jones said i was gonna cry you bet im gonna cry
549866 you bet youre life im gonna cry you bet your life i will thats my boy thats my boy right there
549867 my dad always used to give me and my sister advice like most kids we didnt always follow that advice
549868 a piece of advice he gave me once was never make athletes your heroes because they make mistakes too i guess i didnt follow that advice very well id like to introduce you to my hero my mentor my father emmitt thomas
549869 my late grandfather is still my hero i remember those long hot summer nights sitting on the porch listening to a game or a fight
549870 he taught me about honor commitment love religion and respect
549871 it happens when youre protecting someone like john elway and what happens is the night before the game you get little or no sleep
549872 because if you didnt do your job youll forever be known as the guy who lost our franchise i would also like to thank john it was worth every sleepless night
549873 were way ahead of where we were because weve had plenty of time to get sgt joes teeth looked at and get them fixed
549874 we realized we had a dental problem so now we now take an active look at what the medical readiness of a soldier is during drill periods
549875 in the guard we mirror what the societal trends are
549876 weve got shortages of medical insurance shortages of dental insurance were no different than anybody else but weve had a plan in place and had it in place long enough it looks like well come out ahead
549877 amidst chaos and confusion in the world peace and plenty can be found
549878 might get some type of injection in a couple of days
549879 the way jerry blevins is throwing and brad ziegler is throwing i could potentially use anybody in any situation right now
549880 i dont want to say that is no longer the closer it might be more how well the other two guys are doing
549881 um homem que ousa desperdi ar uma hora ainda n o descobriu o valor da vida
549882 the new sentences will be completely transparent what youll see is what youll get
549883 we certainly agree that the sentences should be more explicable to the public so that they understand them so that truth in sentencing does exist but we dont want to see people suddenly getting locked up for one third longer
549884 we believe that we have a strong economic course of action to take australia through these difficult global economic times
549885 that clear direction has to be based on responsible economic management and responsible economic management remains anchored in a 22 billion budget surplus a buffer for the future
549886 there are signs that the economy is slowing but there are still lots of strong features of the australian economy theres still lots of reasons why we are in good shape compared with all the other major economies in the world
549887 we had a situation where it was over heating where government spending was growing too fast we had inflation at a 16 year high the former government was not investing in skills and infrastructure
549888 but its crucial that we dont get spooked by one or two bad sets of figures
549889 that will keep the economy ticking along reasonably well in my view
549890 woah i said to myself that was classy classy classy
549891 a little rain on thursday is an alluring mix part love story part whodunit part poetry it is a book with something for everyone
549892 i really wasnt looking at getting back into the online markting and sales but then after researching many of the internet business opportunties out ther i was totally astonished by what i saw offered by the little guy network
549893 having your voice listened to is a privilege not a right and its a privilege thats earned in proportion to the contribution level not volume level
549894 because she played a similar part in walk the line
549895 my experiences post flight were ones of not being very productive for quite awhile depression and alcoholism things like that
549896 i was trying to recover from that and ran into lois afterwards
549897 i was actually scared that i was never going to see him again
549898 i literally said i will probably never see him again
549899 she got over it but she was always wishful that hed come back
549900 she kept his toy she had a scrapbook with his picture
549901 at first of course we thought its the wrong dog
549902 she actually wanted to go to georgia to pick him up but the ride back was too long
549903 it was a very nice moment just to see him he was doing well he looked well kept
549904 my understanding is that natalie ran off into the bathroom and started crying right away she is a real animal lover
549905 somebody must have taken him there i honestly dont think he walked there
549906 her first words were she was very happy to see very nice people she was ecstatic
549907 the retreat at the parliament building will give the leaders the opportunity to have unstructured talks in an informal atmosphere
549908 saarc declarations are divine but the devil is in the detail
549909 we need collective action to wipe out terrorism in the region

549913 in addition to the handouts each student will get to spend priceless time with local experienced emergency personnel who will help them understand the importance of safety and being prepared for an emergency
549914 i pledge allegiance to my flag and the republic for which it stands one nation indivisible with liberty and justice for all
549915 the deal was most of the aircraft spaces in beijing were already taken by chinese government officials plus government officials from other countries
549916 we knew there was a need for parking for any corporate officials who wanted to attend
549917 the head of the airport there was happy to work with us
549918 he wants to let corporate leaders know about tianjin and the newly expanded airport
549919 in china theres only three main airlines and theyre owned by the government theres no hangars for private jets no one trained to maintain them and no direct flights
549920 its a super super nice museum and all theyve got in there is a small plaque describing the explosion
549921 i was thinking that museum would probably be the perfect place for that statue
549922 maybe the statue is something we need to look at and if nothing else to protect it in our artifacts area until it can be decided what to do
549923 might be a way to find a place for it
549924 something that could be part of the museum but not with that sculpture
549925 the arsenal is a part of wilmingtons history as much as joliets
549926 were heroes as much as the servicemen who died in the war
549927 we might have had a couple of defendants whose cases could be reviewed and even if the court allowed them a reduction in sentence they would still remain in prison because of the time they have left to serve under the mandatory minimums
549928 from a police officers prospective there are stiffer sentences and the cases are also adjudicated faster in federal courts
549929 its bad enough when you hit a dog or a deer but hitting a horse thats the fear i think everybody is holding their breath hoping wont happen
549930 i have a hunch that someplace here its ultimately going to happen if we get enough horses running loose
549931 thats the reality of whats eventually going to happen with these quote unquote back to nature horses if a minivan with a family hits one of those horses its going to kill a bunch of the family
549932 id rather hit a horse in a delta 88 than a little prius
549933 im taking in strange horses with no shots no blood work no nothing and hoping i find the owners or an outlet for them
549934 ive also heard from my compadres out in the western states that theyre seeing more of it there on the wide open prairies
549935 all during the winter grain prices were very high and hay was in very short supply
549936 horses are often a luxury that become harder and harder to maintain
549937 that show a very significant rise in complaints about the mistreatment of horses
549938 but they have absolutely no idea what pain and suffering theyre going to cause
549939 it was brought up to me by a well known trainer that we have these horses that are just factious theyre not dependable theyre not rideable
549940 it struck me as odd theyd put a big iron gate up it made you wonder whats in there
549941 they the fbi should have waited until after 1 30 p m
549942 its not unusual for people to jump a place in line at a four way stop and not to wait their turn or to push that yellow line before the bar comes down on the tracks
549943 were looking for synergies for the two companies to become more than the two parts
549944 for us from a production risk standpoint it expands our drawing area it allows us to spread our overhead over additional volume

549971 i didnt decide to run for president to start a national crusade for the political reforms i believed in or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism in truth i wanted to be president because it had become my ambition to be president in truth id had the ambition for a long time
549972 i had it going today was able to mix in my fastball with changeups
549973 sometimes you have to say its one of those days you hate to trivialize it because there are things you can control when youre up there
549974 when you look back on it you say there are things you could have done better
549975 mussina got the fastball in the spots he needed to
549976 we just couldnt get much going he knows what hes doing out there and after we did solve him they just kept addding on runs

549980 i dont know if i would have wanted to be out there on dry tires that were nine years old but the rain tires held up very well
549981 for the first time for these guys to have a race in the rain we actually got a race in that was a good thing it felt really slow and the car was slipping around getting up to speed there when we first put the wets on i thought im real trouble here because ive just got no grip obviously i had no grip better than everyone else because we did pretty well it was treacherous it was tricky but i think all the drivers kept of the race track for the most part and we got a race in which is important i think to nascars credit for not running rain races very often that they did a pretty good job

549986 well make every effort to keep the show unaffected by current frigid political settings without pretending that our two countries are tightly knit as either case may strip this dialogue of its freshness and appeal
549987 this exhibit is a valuable step in showing members of each others larger communities how we truly think and feel
