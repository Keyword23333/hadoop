8490002 gunsalus distinguishes between traditional assertive bullies who throw their weight around with bluster and force and victim bullies who use claims of having been wronged to gain leverage over others pp 123 4 unlike simple passive aggression victim bullies use accusations as weapons and ramp up the accusations over time unlike a normal person who would slink away in shame as the initial accusations are discredited a victim bully lacks either guilt or shame honestly believing that s he has been so egregiously wronged in some cosmic way that anything s he does or says is justified in the larger scheme of things so when the initial accusations are dismissed the victim bullys first move is a sort of double or nothing raising the absurdity and the stakes even more

8490012 the human species is not destroying itself whatever happens we will cope we always have and we always will that may be an inconvenient truth but it is no convenient lie
8490013 cerulo a professor at rutgers university wrote a book last year called never saw it coming in it she argues that we are individually institutionally and societally hellbent on wishful thinking
8490014 why is it that we worry about temperature in 2100 the effects in 2100 are caused by emissions in 2080 everybody in this forum will be dead by then and also their children

8490016 as to the underlying pessimism i seem to detect please dont sell yourselves and others short
8490017 whilst the annual median for the year to june 2008 indicates the albany urban area has increased by 1 5 per cent over the previous year to june 2007 the city has recorded its first but significant fall of 11 per cent
8490018 this has reduced the quarterly median price to 385 000 which is back to mid 2006 levels
8490019 there was also a significant fall in sales volume in the june quarter of around 35 per cent
8490020 if youre talking about normal residential lots they pretty much went from 50 00 to 200 000 in two years but theyve actually come back to an average price of around 170 000
8490021 i believe prices are now where they should be and if they stay there for the next couple of years it will be great
8490022 we are developing a strategy for the citys involvement in recreation planning in albany and a master plan for the long term provision of facilities
8490023 the council has stepped back from a previous model for a multi sport development but the area still needs significant funding to replace outdated and inadequate facilities
8490024 we have decided to refurbish the sanford road bmx track and open it for the public
8490025 any further assistance with developing sport and recreation facilities in albany will help nurture a healthy and active community and will be welcomed by the council
8490026 a feasibility study is still to be done but land has been allocated near the kart track
8490027 what we will need is for all the interested groups to get together and define what they need
8490028 i am pleased the multi sport centre is not going ahead as it would have been a great impost on sporting groups particularly soccer
8490029 it now opens up their scope to have the grounds retained
8490030 a major redevelopment of centennial park is desperately needed and the funding boost to the csrff program under a liberal government will help deliver this important project to the people of albany
8490031 we want to encourage albany residents to participate in sport and recreation so it is essential that we help provide our community with the best possible facilities
8490032 some problems have been remedied but how long do you keep fixing a building that needs replacing
8490033 having championed the need for this project during my three and a half years in parliament i am pleased that the forthcoming election has finally provoked some renewed interest from the major parties although the timing may create a level of scepticism in the community
8490034 its interesting that liberal leader colin barnett made the same commitment prior to the 2001 state election
8490035 yet he had not accomplished a bunbury to albany pipeline extension when he had an earlier opportunity during his almost eight years as energy minister in the court government
8490036 in june 2006 i took the then premier to task when he talked up the importance of piping gas to the eastern states
8490037 but he refused to extend the same amenity to country businesses and consumers here in the south west and great southern
8490038 we have a great result for current and future students who will live work and learn through this college
8490039 most imortantly it speaks of the communitys persistence tenacity and sheer hard work to help achieve it
8490040 the mt barker communitys enthusiastic involvement in this project has been fantastic and combined with the outstanding new facilities will create a vibrant school for future generations
8490041 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8490042 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8490043 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8490044 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8490045 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8490046 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8490047 the rising spreads clearly show some buyers are backing away from the market but in general i think money funds continue to buy and hold fannie and freddie debt said peter crane president of crane data llc a firm in westborough massachusetts that tracks money market funds
8490048 they assume the short term money market debt will be safe and covered

8490072 i really believe this and im not just blowing smoke i really think thats the best defense ive ever played against
8490073 its not bad to have a guy 65 or 66 and 270 pounds as a defensive end
8490074 he has a lot of range and can rush the passer
8490075 you are as good as your defensive line is going to be were pretty deep and id like to be able to say we can send them in waves and keep fresh legs on the field and take a lot of pressure off the defensive backs and the linebacking group
8490076 our offense is good but our defense is strong in every aspect i think our offense will only have to score 17 points thats how good our defense is im not just talking were that damn good
8490077 hes had that experience but hes nowhere near his potential yet
8490078 us older players were going to have to help him along maybe take some of the ease off of him in the running and passing game by getting in the backfield and helping him make tackles
8490079 we just dont have the experience we had were experienced in the secondary we have a pretty good defensive line and hopefully they can make up for some of the mistakes the linebackers will make early on until they get the feel for things in game situations
8490080 i feel good about that position but what they can accomplish remains to be seen
8490081 its going to be great to have seymour loftman back after missing him last year
8490082 a lot of people dont remember but he led the team in picks two years ago before he got hurt
8490083 they catch way too many of my passes in practice anyway
8490084 government is always trying to find ways to pay for providing basic services to the public
8490085 there is no reason that millions of dollars should sit gathering dust especially when we are seeking to raise fees and taxes on the public
8490086 were pleased that controller chicks audit acknowledged that overall the department of public works has adequate internal controls over the financial management of its funds
8490087 we appreciate her input and will implement the recommendations as appropriate
8490088 thats what he is there for and it is good that he is there for us hes been through it he knows things
8490089 the way ive been hitting lately is not acceptable by my standards because i expect a lot out of myself no matter how old i am or how long ive been here i have a certain standard to perform lately i havent been doing it and yes its embarrassing
8490090 every day you start over make the best of it and learn from it this is probably one of a million slumps ill go through and dealing with adversity is all part of it thats the positive side of it for me everybody struggles
8490091 players know people want to see them play and usually they bear down and do better all those people probably never saw jay struggle as a kid
8490092 i know i have to be aggressive but be aggressive in the strike zone these pitchers know they dont have to throw me a strike so they wont why should they i wouldnt either if i didnt have to
8490093 this is all a learning process and i need to shorten that process as quickly as i can
8490094 i havent struck out seven straight times in my life ever in your whole life you are always experiencing first times and hopefully thats the last time i experience that
8490095 i was going up there more trying not to strike out than get a hit
8490096 thats a bad approach thats like playing not to lose rather than playing to win thats over
8490097 he struck out 10 didnt walk anybody and gave up only three runs and seven hits
8490098 ill meet with gm walt jocketty when we get back tonight
8490099 that makes for not throwing in the towel for us playing as if it us contending
8490100 it is better to play contending teams than teams out of it you still have to play its your job
8490101 i dont care if youre playing a game in your backyard you play the game right and you play to win
8490102 if you can defend well as a team that will create scoring chances
8490103 unfortunately for us we fell apart defensively for big parts of the second half
8490104 we just need to work more on our team defending and on our attack
8490105 if we can improve on working with the ball inside the 18 yard boxes both offensively and defensively it will help out our game a lot
8490106 it was a new opportunity a change where i was able to get involved with a growing athletic program
8490107 we got a quality person who has gotten great experience at idaho state
8490108 he has already had some great ideas to make game days much better and has some fun ideas about on field events
8490109 i learned a lot working with nike which is one of the biggest corporations in the united states
8490110 so far he has come in and done a great job
8490111 he has had past experiences before and hes bringing in new ideas and a fresh approach to the position
8490112 there will be a lot of giveaways and a lot of surprises
8490113 we will be getting much more people on the field showing how athletic or un athletic they are
8490114 she has been helpful and given me some great ideas
8490115 when i came in the first day i was all excited and named off a ton of ideas and she just told me to get them done
8490116 i dont even remember the game because i was on so many medications and everything
8490117 president bill perry and the interim athletic director ken baker were standing right next to me as i am bawling my eyes out because i was sitting on a golf cart all doped up and not out there playing
8490118 we cant do this without eileen we cant do this without her
8490119 anything i needed to get done out there when she was playing i just gave her a little wink or a signal or something like that and she understood exactly what i needed done
8490120 when i was so used to just going out and doing it leading by example just telling them with words didnt feel like it was enough and took a lot more time
8490121 it was a little discouraging but at the same time at least i was doing something to help them
8490122 sometimes i get ahead of myself and i do too much and i pay for it on the back end but it is much easier than it was last year
8490123 even if i have to jog through something i can whereas before i could barely walk through it now i can actually show them what they need to be doing and it is not as stressful and frustrating
8490124 it is also a switch from being friends with the girls to being their coach
8490125 not in a sense that i need them to call me coach o or whatever but just that i cant really have that same friendship teammate relationship that i have had with them in previous seasons
8490126 when youve played together with these girls for so many years you develop a special bond and its not going to go away but you will learn to adapt it to a more coaching centered standpoint
8490127 it gave me a lot of time to do other things and to focus on student teaching
8490128 i think i kind of obsessed over rugby and it gave me a chance to get away from it for a little while
8490129 she is the same old eileen she was always making sure we knew what we were doing and if there was something that needed to be changed she made sure she told us
8490130 she was so much fun to play with and we all learned a lot from her
8490131 she knows when to be serious and when to make a joke she knows how to prepare us well and it is no doubt going to show how well prepared we are this season
8490132 we can actually do our work in some ways we are very very happy
8490133 the only reason we got them back was because of all of the media attention this received
8490134 i have no reason to believe they are facing any sort of charges
8490135 then again would i believe that the minneapolis police would stop people for walking down the street at 1 30 in the morning
8490136 install apptapp option is only avaliable on the iphone ipod safari if you go to the site on your pc you wont see it
8490137 it gave voice to americas ideals in a way that has been done very rarely in any speech in american history
8490138 i was 2 years old at the time and i think its fair to say that had it not been for not just the speech but the movement behind the speech the sentiments behind the speech the work and the toil and the risks that were taken by previous generations then i wouldnt be in denver on thursday accepting the nomination for the presidency
8490139 hes going to set the stakes of this election the risks of continuing down the road were on which is plainly what sen mccain is offering and hes going to talk about an alternative path thats rooted in the best of what this country is and the kind of future that we can build if we take it
8490140 will make the skin tone look softer and smoother while covering annoying little wrinkles
8490141 the power in washington is like tolkiens ring really good wonderful people get the ring and it changes them and they cant put it down they cant let it go they gotta fight and do whatever it takes
8490142 will have nowhere else to go short of pre emptive strikes against irans nuclear facilities
8490143 if we had some eggs we could have ham and eggs if we had some ham
8490144 keep the americans in the germans down and the russians out
8490145 there are things beyond the control of missouri that are impacting the employment picture here
8490146 but there are also some things that are particular to st louis
8490147 thats where youre seeing this accumulating effect of rising prices
8490148 are going to become very cautious and not add that extra person
8490149 companies are trying to save on real estate the cost of employment a variety of things
8490150 i even applied at mcdonalds and if mcdonalds doesnt call you somethings wrong
8490151 station owners have to value whats in their tanks based on what the replacement costs are whats it going to cost them to buy off the rack basically
8490152 under any scenario were going to see more nuclear power because its just going to be more cost effective once theres a price on carbon
8490153 the operation is over we killed third militant early today thursday
8490154 we know the legislature authorized up to 25 billion but the amount that could really make a difference likely is much higher
8490155 there would be a lot of research and development money there
8490156 if i see that this is going through then yes i would be pushing for it
8490157 were going to try to convince chrysler were the best thing since sliced bread in fenton
8490158 the stat block for humans doesnt say they produce shit 1d4 times a day but there are still outhouses in the forgotten realms arent there
8490159 do you know what i despise most about you your unshakable belief that youre
8490160 man how many bad slasher movie tricks can they put into this thing
8490161 we respect the right of elected officials such as speaker pelosi to address matters of public policy that are before them but the interpretation of catholic faith has rightfully been entrusted to the catholic bishops given this responsibility to teach it is important to make this correction for the record
8490162 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8490163 the values must be valid issue field ids see issuefieldconstants class
8490164 thank you for that warm welcome im greatly honored to be here tonight
8490165 no dude didnt you hear they released spore today but only for today only if you dont get it today youll have to wait till sunday
8490166 ugh at least spore comes out tomorrow wait i dont take early morning showers on saturdays omfg its f king monday
8490167 the political cable shows were filled with liberal pundits liberal anchors liberal guest historians liberal weather gals and guys liberal news you can use chicks and liberal political strategists i e out of work former democratic national committee gofers
8490168 as anticipated the second quarter was a challenging one for us
8490169 we were not immune from the decline in store traffic and increasing promotional activity across our industry
8490170 well really see the first taste of that in the third quarter and fourth quarter of this year thats really one of the major question marks that is out there right now as to how is the customer going to respond to these higher price points
8490171 we are taking a cautious approach to the back half of 2008 by appropriately reducing guidance and tightening our standards for capital management
8490172 were it not for the duke lacrosse case she likely would be described as a bright young woman from durham north carolina who has had a difficult life
8490173 she is female which addresses the novelty of the opposition she is smart and well respected she is knowledgeable on key issues especially domestic policy
8490174 the conservatives could probably stomach hutchison a lot better than a tom ridge or joe lieberman
8490175 she is a woman and their strategy seems to be to go for disaffected clinton voters but i would say this is more like the chet edwards boomlet it raises the profile there is no downside to being mentioned but hutchison at this point looks like a last minute ploy not a considered judgment
8490176 what they do on a day to day basis has impact not only in this community but really around the world and for our protection
8490177 report of the assessment committee for the national space weather program an interagency initiative to speed improvement of space weather services
8490178 its something of a rambling statement that could use some copyediting as well its
8490179 i think there are other kids who attended the governors school who would be interested in being astronauts but i would rather be doing the math and science part on earth
8490180 thank goodness for online video streaming its about the only way i could watch keith olbermann earlier this week keith an msnbc propagandist who has come to believe people care what he hopes thinks says smeared my colleague howard wolfson who was hillary clintons communication director and is now a fox news political analyst keith compared howard to tokyo rose howard wolfson is a proud liberal who in his appearances on fox has outlined the democrats battle plan for winning the white house he is not preaching defeat to his party after sen clintons defeat he threw his support to barack obama there is room for that kind of opinion in the big tent known as fox news but not in keiths head keith is too important to be constrained restrained might be a different matter by facts he is the heir to huntley to brinkley to chancellor to brokaw sorry nbc keith thinks democrats shouldnt deign to appear on fox thats the same philosophy that served john edwards so well when he was an active candidate among other things like sen edwards keith is a non factor now that the real decisions have been made and like tokyo rose he is a fictional conflation
8490181 im not going to take any lectures from two people who relentlessly attacked hillary clinton its unfortunate that a news organization with a great tradition like nbc has been taken over by those kind of antics
8490182 john moody is a hysterical doctrinaire right wing hack propagandist who conveniently forgets that when he thought i shared his allegiance to his dark view of the world tried to hire me for fox news as for mr wolfson i feel very sorry for the choices he made that led him to his sad state
8490183 when olbermann was out of work he reached out to moody and they had several cordial professional conversations but moody never tried to hire him and an offer was never made keep in mind olbermann was fired by corporate cousin fox sports no chance he would get a job at fnc would nbc news hire someone just fired from nbc sports

8490185 the bottom line however is that the strong negative trend in summertime ice extent characterizing the past decade continues
8490186 we could have no ice at the north pole at the end of this summer and the reason here is that the thin ice and this ice we call first year ice the ice that tends to melt out in the summer
8490187 its possible that ships could sail from alaska right to the north pole
8490188 clearly if you look over what we have seen in the past three years and where we were headed we are in this long term decline and we may have no ice at all in the in summer by 2030 or so
8490189 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8490190 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8490191 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8490192 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8490193 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8490194 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8490195 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8490196 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8490197 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
8490198 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
8490199 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8490200 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8490201 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8490202 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8490203 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8490204 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8490205 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8490206 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8490207 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8490208 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8490209 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8490210 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8490211 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8490212 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8490213 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8490214 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8490215 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8490216 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8490217 every market place has its ups and downs but ireland is fundamentally a sound economy and things will pick up again
8490218 we are going to hope for the best but were preparing for the worst
8490219 nagin said at the convention wednesday noting that the u s army corps of engineers have been rebuilding the levees breached during katrina
8490220 this will be a good test for us i wish we didnt have to take this test
8490221 everybody should be looking at their plans just like were looking at our plans and get ready
8490222 if they dont have a plan you still have time if you wait until the storms on top of you thats when panics going to set in and you dont think wisely
8490223 although we have made strides in rebuilding our infrastructure the levees have not been fully repaired and we have an 800 million budget gap to complete our sewage and water systems
8490224 the citizens should not be worried about the flooding again
8490225 we definitely dont want to wait until saturday or sunday to decide what to do
8490226 as long as theres a chance that well be in this storms path ill be here in louisiana
8490227 im going to make sure im here personally to help lead the preparation efforts and if necessary any recovery efforts that are necessary after the fact

8490264 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8490265 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8490266 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8490267 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8490268 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8490269 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8490270 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8490271 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8490272 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8490273 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8490274 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8490275 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8490276 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8490277 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8490278 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8490279 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8490280 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8490281 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8490282 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8490283 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8490284 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8490285 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8490286 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8490287 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8490288 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

8490297 for the past eight years the man in the oval office has tipped his hat over his eyes kicked back his chair and snoozed at his desk
8490298 we need to accept the fact that there are going to be some angry white guys who wont vote for barack obama because hes a black man the fundamental challenge for us is not the whole issue of what color his skin is its that our economy has gone into the toilet
8490299 well strike their hideouts we wont show any kind of relaxation
8490300 all these years since his marriage with ms bhutto in 1987 i have known zardari on no occasion did i find him absent minded or forgetful as reported

8490308 sir would you mind giving an old man a ride to the other side there doesnt appear to be a passageway by foot
8490309 sir i notice that you let several other riders pass by without making an effort to secure a ride then i came up and you immediately asked me for a ride im curious why on such a bitter winter night you would wait and ask the last rider what if i had refused and left you there
8490310 ive been around these here parts for some time i reckon i know people pretty good
8490311 i looked into the eyes of the other riders and immediately saw there was no concern for my situation it would have been useless even to ask them for a ride but when i looked into your eyes kindness and compassion were evident i knew then and there that your gentle spirit would welcome the opportunity to give me assistance in my time of need
8490312 may i never get too busy in my own affairs that i fail to respond to the needs of others with kindness and compassion

8490317 hes saying please help me please help me with two or three security guards running through traffic trying to catch him
8490318 they were running after him saying thats the guy with the camera
8490319 i cut across and headed that way thinking he will prevent these guys from taking my tape
8490320 i knew that then at least wed be able to get the tape later
8490321 i figured theres no way that the security guards are just going to assault this random dude in front of a cop
8490322 it landed within five feet of me i leaned down to pick it up and i got tackled by two of the dudes they threw me into that ivy covered wall and i was trying to get them off me at one point there were three guards on me i threw the tape to sean and thats when it got really ugly
8490323 he hurled him into it then threw him onto the ground at this point there are two or three officers there
8490324 they beat the shit out of him in front of a cop

8490349 for the lord our god will have no part in unrighteousness or partiality or the taking of bribes
8490350 for there is no partiality or respect of persons with god
8490351 remember this and be assured recall it to mind you transgressors
8490352 are not two sparrows sold for a cent and yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your fathers knowledge
8490353 oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of god how unsearchable are his judgments and unfathomable are his ways
8490354 the secret things belong to the lord our god but the things revealed belong to us and our children forever
8490355 can a man hide himself in hiding places so i do not see him declares the lord do i not fill the heavens and the earth declares the lord
8490356 heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool
8490357 i will never desert you nor will i ever forsake you
8490358 i am with you always even to the end of the age

8490363 youre constantly in a recruiting mode if this population keeps churning youre constantly training

8490384 to find so many polar bears at sea at one time is extremely worrisome because it could be an indication that as the sea ice on which they live and hunt continues to melt many more bears may be out there facing similar risk

8490386 my girls will tell their children in this great country where a girl from the south side of chicago can go to college and law school and a son of a single mother from hawaii can go all the way to the white house that we committed ourselves to building the world as it should be

8490388 were going to talk to big money and little money and eddie money and don money
8490389 the animating principle of my faith as taught to me by church and home was that the cardinal sin was abuse of power
8490390 it was not only required as a good catholic to abhor and avoid abuse of power but to do something to end that abuse
8490391 i get comfort from carrying my rosary going to mass every sunday its my time alone
8490392 there are elements within the church who say that if you are at odds with any of the teachings of the church you are at odds with the church i think the church is bigger than that

8490412 there are some serious technical challenges with getting this sdk up and running and quite frankly they are too dangerous and time consuming i dont think we can get the resources to muster this up consider that right now we need to build an ra3 mod sdk fix kw world builder patch kw and ra3 to be perfectly honest those are all more critical than a kw mod sdk at this point i know its not ideal in saying that but if you poll the community i am certain that would be cold hard truth
8490413 i am not giving up on a kw mod sdk just yet but we have yet to see some of the truly great mods for c amp c 3 come out and i feel the community spreads themselves very thin at best right now a kw mod sdk would bring new balance mods full blown mods are unlikely as many people will move to mod ra3 and finish up their c amp c 3 mods i whole heartedily believe this
8490414 i am looking to potentially meet a middle compromise instead of releasing a full blown sdk i am looking to potentially release all of our kw art assets so that you can mod those in to c amp c 3 kw does not bring a lot of new significant functionality to the table the primary being the mechapede garissoning customization and epic units those are hard things to live without in a mod but i think we can meet halfway

8490436 es preocupaci n del gobernador del estado fidel herrera beltr n lograr que en estos ltimos tres a os que le quedan al frente de veracruz puedan todas las comunidades ind genas del estado estar bien comunicadas para de esa manera impulsar el desarrollo
8490437 dicho estudio se hizo en latinoam rica as como en varios pa ses de europa
8490438 a wake up call that more parents need to be involved
8490439 i think everything is going to be a big deal for a while after what happened
8490440 one of the most powerful safety security measures we have is people
8490441 making sure every kid has at least one strong relationship with an adult in whom they can confide
8490442 take care of themselves because were going to rely on them pretty heavily in the days and weeks to come to return normalcy
8490443 says to a school a leader or community that i care about whats going on there and i want to support their work
8490444 you have to keep your head make sure you focus on the kids and communicate
8490445 im willing to consider any and all options that we think might enhance the safety of our kids
8490446 it might deter a student from bringing a weapon to school but its not 100 percent
8490447 the question is do we need to have more options for kids
8490448 the bottom line is hes doing what i expect him to do hes leading in the good and in the bad
8490449 i dont know if he has any choice but to do what hes doing right now but hes doing well
8490450 i hope none of us ever become experts in dealing with these horrible experiences
8490451 i consider it noteworthy that georges article was published in csicops in house magazine
8490452 i was contacted by a variety of investigators buffs cranks proponents and detractors alike james oberg a frequent mouthpiece for certain nasa projects and self styled ufo debunker wrote to disparage my story and to ask provocatively since you obviously feel free to discuss top secret ufo data what would you be willing to say about other top secret aspects of the atlas warhead which you alluded to briefly i told mr oberg where to put his misplaced cynicism
8490453 both men have worked with me and gotten to know me in my efforts for the character references provided by klass are certainly interesting given his stock response over the years to those who questioned his motives whenever he was confronted with the charge that he was not really a ufo skeptic but a disinformation agent for the u s government klass would always recoil indignantly and ridicule the notion so who does he choose to present as character references in his letter to jacobs two of the top intelligence officers in the u s government
8490454 dear mr collier responding to your fed ex letter of november 14 1995 regarding the validity of the january 1989 mufon ufo journal story by dr robert jacobs it is all true as presented and yes i have also responded to other researchers in the past but only after dr jacobs released the details of these sightings sic negating my secrecy bond
8490455 the image orthicon camera system we used in capturing the unidentified flying object on film had the capacity to photograph the nuts and bolts of the missile launch and its super sonic flight in retrospect i now regret not being able to evaluate the film for more than 3 showings the only people in attendance of the viewing were the director of the office of the chief scientist and his assistant two government agents lieutenant jacobs and myself i e kingston george was not present rh the two government agents confiscated the film and placed it in a briefcase and departed after i had checked their authorization to leave with the film i was instructed later by the office of the chief scientist the judge advocate generals office and my commanding officer to consider the incident top secret
8490456 we are meeting in secret with a congressional committee if these meetings were public it would prove
8490457 the american labor movement like the old gray mare aint what she used to be down from a high of 35 percent of the workforce to less than 8 percent labor is on its last legs
8490458 thats jesus speaking about his calling a calling to a mission
8490459 yes we have some work to do for the work of love is the work of change weve been called to bring change as gandhi said we must be the change we want to see in the world change isnt easy change isnt simple or obvious its just essential right here right now
8490460 among the basic rights of the human person must be counted the right of freely founding labor unions these unions should be truly able to represent the workers and to contribute to the proper arrangement of economic life another such right is that of taking part freely in the activity of these unions without fear of reprisal
8490461 we reaffirm the right and desirability of workers in the united states to organize and form unions we decry the growing wage of anti unionism mounting in the nation today which asks people to forget the struggles that led to this form of negotiation as a just way to settle differences
8490462 part two how far will the following people go you want to guess which number obstacle the person will fail on stage 1 1 8 the tarzan swing and net climb will count as one stage 2 9 14 stage 3 15 22 final 23 whole stage will count as an obstacle if a person fails in between obstacles the obstacle he she is approaching will be the obstacle they failed on only if they completely clear the obstacle beforehand before falling timing out
8490463 as for online its always the last thing to be revealed so you probably have another month or two to wait before seeing anything related to online
8490464 i am unaware of many aspects of the customization engine in u c this includes a my cars system tier system and tuning aspects its not really something i spent a lot of time with while i was there
8490465 as for online its always the last thing to be gt revealed so you probably have another month or two to gt wait before seeing anything related to online

8490468 eaters must understand that eating takes place inescapably in the world that it is inescapably an agricultural act and that how we eat determines to a considerable extent how the world is used
8490469 gods gracious and free action does not destroy creation it establishes it once again it gives creation back to us as creation as a sheer gift
8490470 you anticipate what i would say though you cannot know how earnestly i say it how earnestly i feel it without knowing my secret heart and the hopes and fears and anxieties with which it has long been laden dear doctor manette i love your daughter fondly dearly disinterestedly devotedly if ever there were love in the world i love her
8490471 my love for linton is like the foliage in the woods
8490472 hes more myself than i am whatever our souls are made of his and mine are the same and lintons is as different as a moonbeam from lightning or frost from fire
8490473 that process is in line with the procedures established by the previous government on the consideration of visa applicants
8490474 mr broadus has not been granted a visa there are further steps required beyond character assessment before a visa is granted
8490475 the department has now decided to do a full assessment of the character of mr broadus
8490476 kelly had already called in sick to work for radio 1 on sunday because she was doubled over with bad stomach pains
8490477 when she got home she reached up to get a glass from the cupboard to have a drink when the entire thing fell off the wall and smashed into her face
8490478 kelly was in a right state she had blood pouring out of a lump in her head while black and blue swelling started almost straight away around her eyes it s a nasty cut and she was shook up at first but luke made sure she was ok
8490479 with eyes firmly fixed on the future and in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together with one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8490480 last night hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything in her power to elect barack obama
8490481 that makes two of us actually that makes 18 million of us
8490482 i want you to know this has been a joy boy did we have a good time trying
8490483 one of us needs to be with her at all times
8490484 sometimes the harder thing to do is to do nothing
8490485 its easy to wear your heart on your sleeve when youre not looking in his eyes
8490486 well you do know how to light up a room
8490487 the woman is twice your age she may be three times your age
8490488 you expect me to be there at a moments notice its confusing
8490489 ah five years of misery but worth every penny dont you think
8490490 go in for sex and get stung thats pretty much every mans fear
8490491 hey sara is it true that the miniature cases keep grissom up at night
8490492 this girl blames me for the death of ernie dell i took away the only person she ever loved and now shes going to do the same thing to me
8490493 you just dont like any other women in his life
8490494 entomology textbook grissom gave it to me last christmas when i cant sleep i read
8490495 funny i didnt get a christmas gift from grissom to hodges did you
8490496 ive been there we get attached to people we try to fix their problems it doesnt work
8490497 for years csi fans have been wondering if there was more going on between grissom and sara than meets the eye well last night we found out that the answer is definitely yes
8490498 and i think thats whats interesting to me and always has been which is why i never wanted the relationship to go away i wanted the i think jorja and i both wanted this thing we know we have chemistry and we know we can play off it and we enjoy it its just like in any relationship if you run into somebody where that feels right for you dont want to give it up so you do things to protect it
8490499 but they obviously always have been interested in each other and theres an intimacy there we just thought it was time for the audience to see that there is an intimacy there
8490500 i think that we didnt show too much at the end of last season and what did we show did we show anything no we know that theyre intimate but they may be intimate in the way that a married couple is intimate that theyve already done all that other stuff and now they just hang out and talk about what they did today
8490501 and thats what he loves about her shes a bulldog and he always saw that in her and he always knew that subconsciously the only person the only person whod be able to give him a second look is someone whos not willing to take the first look for granted
8490502 were not turning into a soap opera but were going to see their anger with the world and them reaching out to each other
8490503 sure sara loves grissom in the buff but i dont think thats what the scene was about one of my favorite things was grissom talking about the nearness of death for these characters and maybe they go home after the things theyve seen and have some tenderness of their own
8490504 grissom has a greater understanding of his feelings for sara jorja fox when he returns hes so excited to see her but shes less excited to see him in part because she spent the day in a landfill but later we are going to see them in grissoms apartment
8490505 i do hope it comes soon another brilliant one is dead bodies and new lives by gsrbritfan although its taken me nearly a week to read it again cant for next chapter
8490506 the most exciting part of gabon was also the most dangerous and that was that the animals were not used to people
8490507 animals are everywhere theyre used to having safari groups come through and tourists come by it wasnt as crazy for them to see a truck full of people
8490508 they scattered to the point that you knew something actually could happen
8490509 we found leopard prints in our catering tent five nights in a row its scary if its your night off and youve had one beer too many and you stumble into catering to try to steal some bread it could be over
8490510 resisted the temptation to make wholesale changes to try to become the flavor of the month
8490511 consistency is the key to survivor s longevity we know what our show is and thats what we deliver every week
8490512 respect brutal honesty whether its something they want to hear or not
8490513 its a case by case basis but in 99 percent of those cases if youre talking about what will help you win the game hands down deception is more valuable
8490514 when people on the show are getting ready to vote somebody out there will be a debate at camp about whether to blindside the person or to tell the person its always followed by the phrase because id want to know the truth is the minute you tell somebody and you clear your conscience by being honest if theyre any good at all you just gave them a real kick in the pants to start playing this game
8490515 are you here to win the game or make friends
8490516 blindsides are catching on more than ever people are realizing that the blindside is the greatest way to take somebody out
8490517 one of the best inventions weve ever come up with
8490518 this season the idols get played in a way theyve never been played before
8490519 it astounded me what happened this time this has never happened its that power of the idol that confuses everybody nobodys quite sure how to handle it it gets to a point where its almost too much power and it does you in i find that fascinating this is the one thing that can keep you safe in the game and yet if youre not careful its the thing that will get you voted out the fastest
8490520 really what youre doing on screen is executing all the ideas youve already thought through
8490521 weve been to some beaches in the world that are so beautiful you wonder why we dont just pack up and move there
8490522 you forget how beautiful the earth is you get stuck in your little city with all its buildings
8490523 if i could run tribal councils in my backyard and then get in my bed and go to sleep that would be perfect
8490524 une pratique consistant jouer le r le de ses personnages h ros de mangas danimation japonaise de tokusatsu de films ou de jeux vid o voire de ses artistes de musique favoris notamment en imitant leur costume et leur maquillage
8490525 you know america has never been afraid of the future and we shouldnt start now
8490526 no way no how no mccain this will not be easy progress never is
8490527 working to block proposed legislation that would throw more juvenile offenders into the adult system
8490528 hope for change in the glass ceiling wont happen with four more years of mcsame hurting the middle class and shipping our jobs overseas to terrorists in afghanistan who hate freedom and apple pie unless tough joe biden who is tough gets to bomb the s out of them
8490529 i feel like this is a better team than last year
8490530 so many signs are there hopefully thats translates into more wins but thats why you go play the games to find out
8490531 we are a stronger team with a better attitude and we play more like a team
8490532 they care about each other they care about themselves they work harder they work longer theyve made themselves better players
8490533 we have to learn from our mistakes and build on what it felt like to win those games
8490534 ive never been happier about where we are as a team
8490535 while the rest of the pack chases the next obama clinton kerfuffle abc news has at least put a team on the streets of denver to chase down real news like how wealthy special interests and corporate fat cats are laying down big loot to ensure primo placement at the federal trough and regulatory racket under the new administration but as asa eslocker found out apparently with a pair of johnny laws hands on his neck the streets arent exactly friendly especially to the more inquisitive of the fourth estate
8490536 cooperative efforts of a for profit business and a non profit organization for mutual benefit it goes on to explain that cause marketing differs from philanthropy and corporate giving because cause marketing is relationship based not donation based
8490537 are you out of your mind this is still a male dominated world its women who need saving screw the men
8490538 its absolutely necessary that i find out who he is to have a normal existence as a human being thats not negotiable in any way
8490539 it would be nice if he wanted to meet me but that would be something i want rather than something needed
8490540 boys thank you for taking your seats and being quiet while we explain our womens history month project
8490541 boys get in here sit down and shut up now
8490542 oh thats when a guy calls you up and just needs you to come over and have sex with him and then go home
8490543 and now because so many young girls have been told that its empowering to pursue boys aggressively theres no longer any need for boys to woo girls or even to commit to a date
8490544 the girls are available in every sense of the word and the boys know it
8490545 hooking up is great but at some point you get tired of everything meaning nothing
8490546 no honey you stay in bed ill go see what that noise is
8490547 i like doing things that i did during my growing up years
8490548 and i have always seen a gujarati play on new year s day there are some really brilliant theatre actors and i enjoy watching them immensely
8490549 we obviously vigorously disagree with that characterization although many of us remain fans of keith and enjoy watching the show on nights other than last night
8490550 catch a wave and youre sitting on top of the world
8490551 dont stand dont stand dont stand so close to me
8490552 kita sudah meminta dan menyampaikan surat peringatan kepada yang berhak pemerintah daerah setempat agar bisa menutup tempat tempat maksiat pada saat bulan ramadhan
8490553 kalau masih membandel insya allah kita tetap melakukan aksi sosial untuk memberikan peringatan itu wajib dilakukan akan tetapi kita mengupayakan tidak ada kekerasan
8490554 jangan ada ormas yang sweeping selama ramadhan yang berhak melakukannya adalah kepolisian
8490555 be of the same mind one toward another mind not high things but condescend to men of low estate be not wise in your own conceits
8490556 not think of themselves more highly than they ought to think
8490557 who was gods final prophet as you may have guessed this produced more than just a small stir which we thought may ease the tension somewhat though it did not
8490558 masjid ini adalah masjid yang pertama kali didirikan di voyvodina sebagian besar penduduk wilayah ini beragama islam kebanyakan mereka dari etnis gipsi sayangnya pemahaman mereka akan islam sangat minim masjid ini sekaligus akan menjadi pusat dakwah islam di wilayah ini

8490567 temos uma surpresa para voc s teremos um convidado especial esta noite
8490568 my government has always been in favour of providing the best possible to its employees and it will also execute the sixth pay commission recommendations as early as possible
8490569 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8490570 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines this is a fight for the future and its a fight we must win together
8490571 no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8490572 that cause is the same thing that obama and the rest of the democratic party are fighting for
8490573 moved to close the divide among fellow democrats on tuesday night by offering a forceful and unequivocal endorsement of her fierce rival
8490574 and delivered an emphatic plea to unite behind her rival senator barack obama no matter what ill will lingers
8490575 betrayed none of the anger and disappointment that she still feels and that friends say has especially haunted her husband
8490576 rest to a bitter primary battle that left many of her supporters especially women seething months later
8490577 the most recent washington post abc news poll showed that only 42 percent of clinton voters classify themselves as solidly behind obama and 20 percent plan to vote for mccain
8490578 but in denver clinton supporters sometimes classified themselves as belonging to one of two categories the sad and the angry
8490579 a nettlesome problem that appears to be contributing to the campaigns failure to keep pace with ambitious fund raising goals it set for the general election
8490580 has led mccain in the head to head surveys most of the summer but things at the moment appear to be changing
8490581 if barack obama gets the traditional post convention bounce in the polls it cant come soon enough
8490582 i dont know i havent talked to her in 10 or 15 years

8490624 tutti ormai in occidente si pongono il problema di mettersi nei panni della russia

8490631 la nostra condotta politica oggi di un partito di opposizione ma si contraddistingue per la seriet e la coerenza verso i nostri elettori
8490632 da tempo ludc aveva posto lattenzione sulle aree agricole e sul censimento delle stesse
8490633 e stata necessaria la violenza su i due turisti olandesi per capire che a roma sono centinaia le strutture ex agricole abbandonate e occupate da clandestini e da persone senza fissa dimora

8490641 una scelta non facile ma lunica possibilit per salvare le vite delle persone
8490642 mediatore e pacificatore per il regolamento politico partendo dal riconoscimento dell integrit territoriale della georgia mentre la sua leadership ha scelto unaltra strada
8490643 si tratta di una evidente annessione di quei territori che sono parte della georgia
8490644 una balcanizzazione su base etnica del caucaso un pericolo serio per tutti
8490645 si cambia il criterio della cittadinanza con la base etnica e ci ci deve seriamente preoccupare tutti
8490646 annullare la capacit militare nucleare della russia dopo il crollo sovietico che invece rimasta intatta anche a costo di grossi sacrifici economici e che ora la garanzia della nuova politica aggressiva per ricostruire il passato potere

8490653 if you know nothing about yourself you cant tell the difference
8490654 la nostra condotta politica oggi di un partito di opposizione ma si contraddistingue per la seriet e la coerenza verso i nostri elettori
8490655 grazie al loro impegno alla dedizione dei giovani ed alla certezza delle posizioni tenute dal partito
8490656 che lunione di centro ha potuto riscuoter consensi senza rimaner schiacciata fra le due grandi coalizioni elettorali pdl lega e pd idv mantenendo quindi una significativa rappresentanza parlamentare la nostra condotta politica oggi di un partito di opposizione ma si contraddistingue per la seriet e la coerenza verso i nostri elettori siamo consci che nel periodo in cui viviamo i veti pregiudiziali e lostruzionismo allazione di governo siano deleteri per un paese che cerca di risollevarsi testimonianza ne la presenza in aula dei nostri parlamentari a garanzia del numero legale per un corretto svolgimento dei lavori di contro votar a scatola chiusa i disegni di legge presentati significherebbe allinearsi su posizioni che non ci appartengono e sulle quali nutriamo forti perplessit
8490657 la nostra condotta politica oggi di un partito di opposizione ma si contraddistingue per la seriet e la coerenza verso i nostri elettori
8490658 pur esprimendo apprezzamento e condivisione per la posizione espressa dal sen viespoli rispetto alle considerazioni pronunciate nei giorni scorsi dal sottosegretario bertolaso e dal ministro gelmini sul sud italia deve far rilevare allo stesso che purtroppo queste posizioni sono largamente diffuse nel governo di cui egli fa parte
8490659 purtroppo prosegue nel suo commento il segretario provinciale delludc da parte di molti rappresentanti dellattuale governo nazionale esiste un vero e proprio pregiudizio negativo sul popolo meridionale e sulla classe dirigente espressa da questa parte del paese in questottica continua santamaria al di l delle generiche rassicurazioni fornite da parte di rappresentanti meridionali del governo da guardare con particolare preoccupazione lintroduzione del sistema di federale fiscale e evidente che da parte di alcuni rappresentanti del governo con questo sistema si punta in qualche modo a penalizzare il sud italia la tesi dalla quale si parte sostiene santamaria e che essendo i meridionali per la maggior parte irresponsabili e menefreghisti in questi anni abbiano approfittato del pubblico denaro prelevato per la maggior parte dai contribuenti settentrionali sperperandolo in vari modi
8490660 sono convinto che prosegue santamaria come sostiene viespoli c necessit di avviare una stagione di responsabilit e di rigore e che questa debba essere vissuta con la stessa intensit dal nord al sud del paese in questo senso il sistema di federalismo fiscale potrebbe rappresentare un giusto pungolo per responsabilizzare la classe dirigente territoriale ad evitare sperperi inutili ovviamente tutto ci deve avvenire indistintamente al nord come al sud del paese mi auguro conclude santamaria che i rappresentanti meridionali del governo al momento opportuno sapranno difendere scontrandosi nei fatti se necessario la parte sana e produttiva del nostro territorio evitando che il sud venga ulteriormente penalizzato
8490661 a man neednt go far to find a subject if hes ready with his salt box
8490662 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8490663 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8490664 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8490665 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8490666 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8490667 my vote has been for hillary the entire time of course the texas votes didnt show up
8490668 he wasnt finished thats for sure but he lived life well with hundreds of friends
8490669 he had a brand new pioneer 50 inch tv that he never watched there was always something better to do
8490670 all our efforts get washed away that night and we have to start over again the next day
8490671 i want everybody to now understand why i am so proud to have joe biden and the whole biden family with me on this journey to take america back
8490672 we want to open up this convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the party
8490673 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8490674 president bill clinton reminded us of what its like when you have a president who actually puts people first
8490675 ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8490676 he has shown a clear grasp of our foreign policy and national security challenges and a firm commitment to rebuild our badly strained military
8490677 he will choose diplomacy first and military force as a last resort
8490678 the choice in this election is clear these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change
8490679 will never torture another prisoner or go to war against another country unless our own security is directly threatened
8490680 the difference between me and obama is that i didnt have any money
8490681 everybody learned a lesson about staying so the highways will be twice as packed this time
8490682 we definitely dont want to wait until saturday or sunday to decide what to do
8490683 we dont need anything of this magnitude to come here
8490684 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario
8490685 we might see oil prices spike 5 to 8 if it really rips into platforms
8490686 im not going to worry about it until i see it in the gulf
8490687 everybody learned a lesson about staying so the highways will be twice as packed this time
8490688 we dont need anything of this magnitude to come here
8490689 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario
8490690 we might see oil prices spike 5 to 8 if it really rips into platforms
8490691 im not going to worry about it until i see it in the gulf
8490692 its really good that hes not meeting with someone and that weve got him
8490693 its important for people to see that there are consequences to getting online and arranging meetings with children for sex
8490694 the fact that someone is arrested doesnt mean theyre guilty of a crime and there are many people who are arrested who are found to be not guilty
8490695 this individual whos been posted on this web site has not been charged has not been tried has not been convicted of any crime this is coming from the attorney generals office and the weight that has with public opinion is very concerning
8490696 the other concern is one of tainting a potential jury that if somebody sees this video on television on the official web site of the attorney general theres going to be some thought at least that the person must be guilty
8490697 we are giving out through our web site as much information as we possibly can and in as many ways as we possibly can because information equals power to protect yourselves
8490698 all the media will show a mug shot theyre still innocent but youre putting their mug shot up there its because theres a need to understand and you always make it clear as i just did that theyre innocent until proven guilty i dont see any difference between what youre media doing and what were posting
8490699 if we can get it right its a tremendous opportunity
8490700 its clear that whining about piracy is not going to be the way for us to build a business in asia
8490701 see that touchdown gregory whupped your ass gregory see that pass gregory

8490703 red dwarf was one of the britains most cherished shows which while it seemed quite geeky had a huge audience
8490704 at its height eight million viewers tuned in so it feels only right that we should have a celebration
8490705 all the major cast members have signed up even those who have been in the news for the wrong reasons lately
8490706 excuse me maam i cant quite reach could you please hold your breast up for me
8490707 youre going to move your legs to the side of the bed and im going to pick
8490708 please dont pick me up off the bed by my scrotum
8490709 john mccain is an honorable man who is running an increasingly dishonorable campaign
8490710 tainted leaders hoping to make a political comeback cannot expect to wipe the slate clean of their wrongdoings with mere apologies after committing an act that went against social and moral values
8490711 mobilising ghost writers for a massive attack on me would not cleanse ones misdeeds or change the norms this could be likened to ostriches burying their heads in the sand
8490712 my challenge to the endorsed candidate ong is for him to send a letter to umno repeating his statement that mca may pull out of bn if umno does not shed its ketuanan melayu policies
8490713 if he does not do any of these things then it would appear that he was just hoping to get political support to attain his ambition without actually intending to walk the talk
8490714 last week i openly pointed out that the mca must review its relationship with umno i pointed out that the perception of a master servant relationship should be removed
8490715 the candidate endorsed by the current party leadership ong now says the mca should consider leaving bn that was the logical conclusion of what i proposed
8490716 the morally tainted blogger dr chua was virtually concerned that the reports in the chinese dailies would not reach the umno top brass so he urged me to write to umno to state my stand
8490717 to me this is totally uncalled for as i always speak my mind freely and fearlessly without having to seek prior approval from any parties besides anybody in his right frame of mind will know that any statements made in any language in malaysia would readily be translated into other languages
8490718 likewise i also highlighted the issue about misappropriation of funds for repair works in two chinese primary schools in johor in 2006 where a rm30 000 contract ended up with only work worth rm3 000
8490719 recently during my rounds of visit to johor i was told much to my surprise and chagrin that the grassroots leader who reported the case to me had in fact been censured by an ex top leader in johor mca
8490720 this is great to keep overseas singaporeans connected to home news and affairs
8490721 a lot of patients have problems using the equipment properly
8490722 if we can enhance peoples ability to use the equipment we hope to reduce patients re presentation to emergency departments he said
8490723 when a liquid drug is administered through a nebuliser a large proportion of the medication vaporizes its a highly inefficient device
8490724 also when an mdi is used without a spacer it is not very efficient either
8490725 it is a metal canister under pressure and the spray hits the back of the throat too fast
8490726 put it through a spacer and the drug rains out through a valve for one or two seconds
8490727 all we require from a reader is they have a clear speaking voice and can read fluently
8490728 raymond who has been hidden in an institution for most of his adult life and is dysfunctional in many senses is also touched with a kind of stellar genius which his brother charlie an l a based automobile dealer and hustler harnesses to save his business the two brothers embark on a rollercoaster journey together that shows raymond a world beyond the hospital gates and charlie the meaning of unconditional love
8490729 it has always been my intent to work on the london stage while ive had many opportunities it was only when i read the complex and charismatic character of charlie babbitt that i knew the time was right i feel very fortunate to make my london bow with such an esteemed producer and director and im also looking forward to working with adam godley who is such an extraordinary talent cant wait to live and work in london a city i adore
8490730 you know you could have asked her nicely and i bet she would have gotten up
8490731 i am the guy that is telling you that you dont have to be a dick
8490732 people do go back to school when jobs are scarce and when jobs are plentiful they leave school to go to work
8490733 we think it was an unmet need that the state had
8490734 were still reaping the benefits of finally establishing a community college in indiana after 40 years of not having one
8490735 i think people have recognized the opportunity and taken advantage of it
8490736 its a gateway to a four year school and its a gateway to a career
8490737 were just going to have to be creative and innovative
8490738 the time for change has come and barack obama is the change we need
8490739 for eight years john mccain has fallen in line with every one of george bushs national security decisions and now he offers up four more years of the same failed policies barack obama has proven that he has the judgment to deliver the change we need
8490740 make better health care and benefits for veterans a higher priority than tax cuts for exxon mobil and the wealthiest americans
8490741 declaremos juntos en una sola voz aqu mismo ahora que barack obama ser nuestro presidente
8490742 es con gran orgullo que anuncio que barack obama es el candidato dem crata para presidente de ee uu por aclamaci n
8490743 me han pedido que les informe que el senador obama acepta la nominaci n
8490744 the irony did strike me i understood that i didnt watch television but i was a media researcher
8490745 you can do critical studies such as what sex and the city means and how to interpret it
8490746 in terms of my own research thats not really the kind of thing i do
8490747 im not really interested in the particulars of this program or that program what i observe is for instance how do young viewers respond to violence to rewarded violence or to violence committed by an attractive character
8490748 my emphasis is on children in media and i thought how do i want to be a parent
8490749 i did some poking around and found there was not much research
8490750 i thought ive got a sabbatical coming up im curious im going to do this i found a publisher that was willing and i started the research
8490751 they tended to see themselves as iconoclastic and unusual and tended to see non viewing as part of their identity
8490752 they had strongly held convictions not just about television but about politics and religion and they seemed to be really involved in their communities for the most part
8490753 politically they were so different in so many ways but when they talked about television they sounded so identical
8490754 both had a sense that television was an industry perhaps conspiracy is too strong a word but they felt television was really trying to get its claws into them and they were being counter cultural
8490755 she actually unplugged the television and stuck it in a trash can
8490756 they said mom youre crazy and she said i know im crazy get used to it
8490757 but by the time of adolescence they came full circle and said they were not all that interested in tv
8490758 there was a sense among both adults and kids that television was not only not that valuable but it was kind of an annoyance
8490759 i remember one quote and i put it in the book that a man said that some people felt us not watching television is a rebuke to those who do
8490760 some people can be sanctimonious and some people are just mildly proud of it being without television
8490761 i think its very much like other decisions people make like being vegetarian
8490762 to perform the requested update ftp connection information is required
8490763 telah terjadi ijtimak dan bulan terbenam setelah matahari terbenam di makkah
8490764 jika ada laporan rukyat dari seorang atau lebih pengamat saksi yang dianggap jujur dan bersedia disumpah maka sudah cukup sebagai dasar untuk menentukan awal bulan tanpa perlu perlu dilakukan uji sains terhadap kebenaran laporan tersebut
8490765 there have been many times when a random person has left a purposefully hurtful comment on tsn and regularly checked back to see if anyone else responded to their comment waiting eagerly to respond with more negativity
8490766 you get what you give and if all you re giving is then thats exactly what youre gonna get
8490767 see that touchdown gregory whupped your ass gregory see that pass gregory
8490768 yo mofo we be kickin this thing reach if its on
8490769 whether adoption of ifrs is in the public interest and would benefit investors
8490770 where is god to be found in the place where he is given entry
8490771 and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8490772 the what why and how of diversity in organizations a practical overview
8490773 as the demographics in vermont change its more important than ever for our human service institutions to be ahead of the curve in addressing issues of diversity as we seek to be more effective and better reflect the public we serve
8490774 while many organizations have identified issues of diversity as a priority it is often challenging to know where to begin this seminar will help clarify the issues and offer an excellent framework for starting or strengthening diversity initiatives
8490775 my god they are going to figure me out on this one
8490776 the economic environment continued to negatively impact mobile phones sales in both mature and emerging markets
8490777 replacement sales remained weak as consumers faced higher prices for fuel and food in addition to higher levels of inflation
8490778 there is so much good practice elsewhere in the world that we should make them our own
8490779 south africas poor penetration of the internet is because of regulation we need new ways of dealing with it re architect the process
8490780 we are all in it together every one has a stake in achieving an optimal solution
8490781 icasa favours a pay as you earn approach allocate the spectrum to those who will economically benefit south africa and charge them based on their income or turnover
8490782 this us 10 million venture investment permitted seacom to complete long lead time work and initiate an 18 month construction programme to further entrench our ready for service date and ensure maximum traction in what is today a very tight supply market
8490783 of course the extra international bandwidth is badly needed and it will definitely help address the current shortfall but it will be some time before the extra capacity delivered brings prices down operators will obviously first have to recover their costs on these very expensive inter country networks and so it is likely to be at least another three years before we see the real benefits of the submarine cable
8490784 shouldnt be a trend or a flash in the pan
8490785 were working towards permanent change and how people think about the environment
8490786 i am sure you dont give a damn about what i need
8490787 if he wont do this then i wont either thatll show him
8490788 its hard to believe that the u s would sabotage the deal at this stage after having initiated the deal and gone out of its way to placate india
8490789 in any case india was involved in negotiating every phrase in the resolutions brought before the iaea and the nsg its futile for india to blame the u s it was at best na ve for it to trust washington to do everything at the nsg
8490790 you can bet that there are some lawmakers who want to bring in amendments
8490791 a large number of countries big and small expressed views similar to new zealands that there needed to be compatibility between the us india agreement and the goals of the nsg the discussions last week were robust and constructive
8490792 while new zealand remains a strong advocate of the npt and the comprehensive test ban treaty and would welcome indias accession to these we have not included these in our package of proposals
8490793 in no way prejudge s the decision on a possible india specific exemption in the nsg
8490794 although the statement was a clear warning indian negotiators ignored it
8490795 they thought a combination of u s strong arm pressures and indias new with us or against us diplomacy would do the trick
8490796 based on concepts already enshrined in u n security council resolutions in domestic legislation of nsg member states and in bilateral nuclear supply agreements which they have concluded over the years
8490797 the u s will probably try to persuade india to accept at least one of the three proposed conditions namely exclusion of enrichment and reprocessing technology
8490798 it is hard to say if india will agree to this while accepting a periodic review of its non proliferation commitments and cessation of cooperation in case of an indian nuclear test
8490799 that the nsg dissenters will be satisfied with such a modified draft the chances of the deal going through before the present term of the u s congress ends seem low
8490800 you have to admire wayne for picking a left field choice
8490801 it will be fascinating to hear from the chairman as to why he roberts is the right guy
8490802 it will be a privilege to contribute to the companys governance
8490803 no siempre nuestras palabras tienen el eco que deseamos que produzcan pocas veces nuestra voz se atreve a decir lo que la cabeza grita y el coraz n susurra pero cuando escribimos nos aislamos nuestra alma toca el papel casi directamente no hay intermediarios entre el exterior y el pensamiento m s oscuro que oculte tu alma as me siento cuando escribo totalmente desnudo frente a miles de personas desconocidas o conocidas qu puedo perder acaso hay algo que perder lo que te escrib en tu blog puede ser insignificante pero encierra una parte de m que existe solo a veces una parte dormida que despiertan muy pocas personas t inconscientemente has sido una t o la ausencia de ti

8490806 the message is clear we in permatang pauh and the malaysian people malays chinese indians ibans kadazans demand freedom and justice in this country we want an independent judiciary and we want an economy to benefit the mass majority and not the corrupt few sons and son in laws
8490807 abdullah does not have the minimal credibility needed to run the country day by day let alone take it in the new directions we need
8490808 instead of creating something streamlined and smooth they came up with this night court to slam people through
8490809 ive never seen this type of law enforcement presence this is i would say a little intrusive
8490810 the profitability of work is a very great value to me
8490811 i am worried that high nominal wage increases might be written off as inflation adjustments we should not create such a mechanism
8490812 if things do not move forward after midsummer we are ready for tougher actions they would involve seeing to it that stores are empty heavy traffic will come to a standstill that is much bigger than driving at 20 km hour
8490813 the government can deduct eur 1 900 from a annual fees but the risen fuel prices have added eur 30 000 to a vehicles annual costs
8490814 already a third of the businesses are operating at a loss regardless of the size of the company those that fail to renew their contracts will be the first ones to go down
8490815 taxes flexible contracts and possible lowering of employers social security expenditure
8490816 the message is that the growth in gdp has almost stopped and we have to reduce our estimates for this years growth
8490817 the impression has emerged that the sdp would promote the interests of some interest group but for me the sdp has never been that
8490818 everyday life has changed politics must change the sdp has stepped into the front line of this change
8490819 that ominously warns of foreign investors buying stakes in us based companies
8490820 the off shoring of jobs with rising gas food and health care costs running a close second
8490821 obama was failing to connect with voters on their economic anxieties this seems to be a direct result of his decision to campaign on loftier goals of change and renewal and not on unemployment and falling real incomes
8490822 the surveillance system picked up a problem that was occurring and allowed us to respond efficiently and effectively to an emerging public health issue this is an example of where our surveillance system worked
8490823 inspecting the products before they make it to the stores before people can actually purchase them those are the audits that arent being made those are the audits that arent being made because theyre too short staffed
8490824 the announcement of these reallocations has been deferred owing to significant communications risks and to allow further policy and communications work to be completed
8490825 we dont swab for listeria anymore the industry does all that themselves
8490826 they just document all this stuff we read their reports if their reports say they do everything fine then they do everything fine
8490827 by the time they finish doing the paperwork theyve got very little time to actually look at anything and it bothers them
8490828 reclaiming paul the apostle in the emerging world among the emerging church notables wholl be presenting we find national coordinator for emergent village edina mn and his pastor of solomons porch minneapolis mn
8490829 oscar said he wasnt budging it was take it or leave it manny opted to pass
8490830 i tried that as late as 15 20 minutes ago oscar will not fight him
8490831 there is still a chance for this fight to take place but we are not budging from our 60 40 stand
8490832 its not right to invite pacquiao to a despedida party by just giving him a bone from the banquet
8490833 still it would all depend on manny whether he will accept 70 30 its all up to him
8490834 negotiations are still ongoing manny pacquiao sent out a statement saying he will explore his options and see what comes out of this situation
8490835 margarito is one of them as well as sergio mora whom i believe that along with pacquiao is the one with the best chance to land the fight
8490836 if someone asked me to choose between antonio margarito and paul williams advertisement i would have to say williams he defeated margarito who claims to be the best welterweight around after his win over miguel cotto but in order to end the squabbling my opinion is that williams and margarito should finish what they started and sign the rematch thats the fight that makes the most sense to them
8490837 it is an incredibly welcoming community when i logged in for the first time i was met with a rousing welcome
8490838 we are improving hatchery operations statewide to help support naturally spawning fish populations
8490839 the proposed changes at tokul creek are part of that broad conservation effort aimed at restoring wild salmon and steelhead stocks while continuing to provide sustainable fishing opportunities on hatchery fish
8490840 if i relied on my mail i would think that the country is concerned only about humane slaughter
8490841 temperature is far more important than it typically gets credit as being when it comes to flavor
8490842 twenty or even 10 degrees can make an enormous difference in how the exact same wine tastes a wine that was thin and hot at room temperature tastes much rounder and fruitier at 5 or 10 degrees lower
8490843 too cold and a wines complexity and aromas are numbed too hot and it tastes alcoholic and flabby

8490846 our monitors flagged a database corruption event in our shipping system over the course of the day we began experiencing similar problems in peripheral databases until our shipping system went down
8490847 weve taken steps to fortify our shipping system with the acquisition of additional equipment and worked with our vendors to verify were in good shape elsewhere
8490848 health food vs healthy foods how can you tell the difference
8490849 if you just make sweet tea and freeze it it becomes a block of ice
8490850 im trying to appeal to people with flavors they know like comfort food
8490851 i loved it but it was just my friends and chads who ate it
8490852 i think its great for sciworks to be recognized for the good work its done for 45 years actually thanks to our dedicated staff and great community
8490853 we really are building a museum going population and im delighted our works have been recognized
8490854 we try to pay attention to what seems to work well in other places
8490855 and bring a lot of national types of concepts and programs into our smaller community

8490863 when i wrote instant gratification i thought they were quick desserts
8490864 but our lifestyles have speeded up so much since then this time i decided to have desserts that we could have on the table in 30 minutes or less
8490865 after doing all the icebox books it just seemed natural to revisit quick desserts
8490866 when you open up the book youre not going to see a layer cake or a pie
8490867 and when you think beyond a traditional cake or a pie you have to get creative
8490868 put something unexpected in it or give it a special touch
8490869 when youre talking about a dessert that serves 12 its that much more effort that much more mess
8490870 when you have only 30 minutes you have to start with really good ingredients because youre not manipulating them a lot
8490871 one of the reasons i came up with these ideas is that i have two kids a dog and im always rushing around this is the way that i live

8490878 in the summer of 2007 when it was obvious that the negotiations were going nowhere the bush administration decided the talks were over and that it was time for independence
8490879 how and when independence was brought about was really a european problem the americans set the debate and the europeans implemented it
8490880 the kremlin is doing nothing different in the caucasus today than what the united states did in 1999 in the balkans back then the us prepared for a military battle against serbia the kosovo script is being played out once more it serves as a precedent and provides russia with a basis for military intervention
8490881 at the end of the large scale manoeuvres something astonishing took place on the georgian side under the eyes of american military advisors instead of sending parts of his army back to barracks president saakashvili sent them in the direction of south ossetia
8490882 on august 3 the russian foreign ministry issued a final warning an extensive military conflict was imminent saakashvilis plans for an invasion were long completed a first draft drawn up in 2006 anticipated that it would be possible to capture all important positions within a space of 15 hours

8490932 my mothers creed is the american creed no one is better than you
8490933 because we will dedicate next wednesday to the extraordinary event that occurred on the road to damascus pauls conversion an essential change in his life that followed from his meeting with christ today we will pause briefly on the whole of his life
8490934 in fact the celebration of the pauline year we are observing follows this chronology the year 2008 was chosen thinking of his birth more or less in the year 8
8490935 in any case paul was born in tarsus in cilicia a jew of the diaspora he spoke greek although having a name of latin origin derived by assonance from the hebrew original saul saulos and he held roman citizenship
8490936 paul seems to be situated therefore on the border of the various cultures roman greek hebrew and perhaps also because of this was disposed to fruitful universal openness to a mediation between cultures to a true universality
8490937 to be understood probably as a laborer of coarse goats wool or linen fibers to make mats or tents
8490938 left tarsus and went to jerusalem to be educated at the feet of rabbi gamaliel the elder nephew of the great rabbi hillel according to the most rigid norms of pharisaism acquiring a great zeal for the mosaic torah
8490939 paul passed into history more as a christian what is more as an apostle than as a pharisee his apostolic activity is subdivided traditionally on the basis of three missionary journeys to which is added a fourth his journey to rome as a prisoner all are narrated by luke in the acts
8490940 in troas another important event took place in a dream paul saw a macedonian from the other side of the sea namely in europe who said come and help us
8490941 it was the future europe that requested the help and light of the gospel
8490942 in this brief account of pauls journeys suffice it to take into account how he dedicated himself to the proclamation of the gospel without sparing his energy and facing a series of grave trials of which he has left us an account in the second letter to the corinthians
8490943 we see a determination that is explained only by a soul truly fascinated by the light of the gospel enamored of christ a soul sustained by a profound conviction that it is necessary to take the light of christ to the world to proclaim the gospel to all
8490944 this i think is what stays with us from this brief account of st pauls journeys to see his passion for the gospel and thus intuit the grandeur the beauty and even more the deep need that all of us have of the gospel
8490945 let us pray so that the lord who made paul see his light and hear his word and touched his heart profoundly make us also see his light so that our hearts will also be touched by his word and so that we too will be able to give todays world which thirsts for it the light of the gospel and the truth of christ
8490946 some persons have been killed and others injured worship centers church property and private houses have also been destroyed
8490947 while i firmly condemn all attacks against human life the sacredness of which demands the respect of all i express my spiritual closeness and solidarity to the brothers and sisters in the faith so hardly tried
8490948 i implore the lord to accompany and support them in this time of suffering and give them the strength to continue in the service of love in favor of all
8490949 religious leaders and civil authorities to work together to restore among the members of the various communities the peaceful coexistence and harmony which have always been the distinguishing mark of the indian society
8490950 we will also ask the prime minister for payment of immediate compensation to victims and their rehabilitation
8490951 so quiet holy and committed to the work of the lord and service of the poor
8490952 lost a young holy dynamic dedicated talented and committed priest one of the promising jewels of our congregation
8490953 the history of the church tells us that it was always through the blood of martyrs that the message of jesus spread to the four corners of the earth
8490954 the shedding of the blood of father thomas in the name of jesus will not be in vain it will bring manifold blessings on the local church as well as on every one of us
8490955 in the context of the death of father thomas pandippally
8490956 here in america and especially here tonight we need to remember two basic truths
8490957 society has an obligation and christians have a gospel duty to provide adequate and compassionate support for unwed and abandoned mothers women facing unintended pregnancies and women struggling with the aftermath of an abortion
8490958 heres the second truth killing an unborn child is never the right answer to a womans or societys problems acts of violence create a culture of violence and abortion is the most intimate form of violence there is it wounds the woman it kills the unborn child and it poisons the roots of justice and charity that bind us all into one human family
8490959 planned parenthood is the largest single provider of abortion and family suppression services in the united states
8490960 this facility in this minority neighborhood should offend every african american and latino family and all of us because every child lost to abortion here subtracts one more life one more universe of possibilities and talent from the future of this community the business of planned parenthood is the prevention of the future and business is good and very profitable at the expense of this community
8490961 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
8490962 as i have reflected on the great issues facing this generation in the life of the church i have become more and more convinced that the answers are to be found through a prayerful faithful and creative engagement with the deposit of faith presented in the documents of the second vatican council and its great summary the catechism of the catholic church
8490963 the vision of fit for mission church is the vision of the second vatican council
8490964 however the questions and challenges that the council fathers saw in embryo we now face in full force such as the challenge of secular humanism the question of moral values in a scientific technological culture and the increasing tensions caused by reason sundered from faith
8490965 all catholics who love the church and care deeply about the future of catholicism in our country
8490966 i know that many of you share my sense of pressing responsibility to foster and promote an authentic catholic identity resisting the pressures to compromise even abandon the truths of our faith
8490967 the majority of our energy and charisms as the people of god are focused on being gathered through the sacraments
8490968 lay liturgical ministries are well developed in most parishes though there are exceptions there is a good deal of collaboration between most clergy and laity in service of the liturgy
8490969 though we are strengthened and healed by the lord through his word and sacraments the majority of us are not responding to our lords call to go out on his mission of hope in particular mission in the parishes with families and young people are undeveloped or underdeveloped with a few exceptions
8490970 part two of gaudium et spes goes on to identify five urgent problems that caused major anxiety in the 1960s
8490971 forty years on i believe the same five areas cause equal anxiety among most people marriage and the family culture social economic life political life war and peace
8490972 just as the council fathers before me i want to encourage you all to attempt to read the signs of the times in the light of the gospel the council and human experience
8490973 there are some things in life which are so important that to dissent from them is to lose the whole meaning of life
8490974 i have written this document in the hope that through our far reaching fit for mission review in the diocese of lancaster we may realize with joy the great gift with which we have been entrusted
8490975 when we all hold true to the beauty and truth of the church established by jesus for the glory of the father in the living presence of the holy spirit then the true glory of gods church will shine out for all to see
8490976 our church will be as intended a creative and liberating force that takes us out into the world and which releases the world from the pains of creation to realize its full potential
8490977 the media ignores this matter it is important to ask the government to pay attention to these issues and not only the general political situation
8490978 it is not only christians who are targeted but other groups and yet the christians feel the injustice of the situation very keenly because they have never played any part in the conflict within the country
8490979 visit of the papal nuncio is a good sign he is giving confidence on the peace and order in mindanao
8490980 we have so many events that we have to be grateful for
8490981 we have received precious gifts especially in this time in life with some foreign countries giving advisories not to visit mindanao
8490982 i do it all for the sake of the gospel

8490986 lose weight by eliminating the crash crave cycle what makes our pasta different is our patent pending formula and unique manufacturing process that protects all but 5 grams of carbohydrates from being digested
8490987 being a lower gi food can potentially make this a good replacement for regular pasta which does not contain much fiber for those who need to control their blood sugar but they still need to eat a controlled portion since a high calorie meal of any sort can make insulin levels spike
8490988 the claim of 5 grams of digestible carbohydrate is tested using the manufacturers own research methods and the term digestible carbohydrate is not currently recognized by the food and drug administration
8490989 this pasta does contain a healthful combination of protein and fiber that fills you up but pasta is still high in calories

8491023 this employment first represents a great step in our air forces ability to deliver precise effects across the spectrum of combat
8491024 the first combat employment of this weapon is the validation of the exacting hard work of an entire team of professionals who developed tested and fielded this weapon on an extremely short timeline based on an urgent needs request we established in the combat zone
8491025 we have consistently used precision guided weapons to engage stationary threats with superb combat effects
8491026 this weapon allows our combat pilots to engage a broad range of moving targets with dramatically increased capabilities and it increases our ability to strike the enemy throughout a much much broader engagement envelope
8491027 teamwork was the name of the game to accomplish this
8491028 from the experts in our air force materiel command who shaped our requirements then developed tested and fielded the weapon to our aircraft maintainers our munitions airmen and weapons loaders and everyone in between they made the operational employment of this weapon possible
8491029 at end game on aug 12 the team of the joint terminal attack controller alongside his ground unit commander in this event ensured all criteria were met for the first combat delivery of the laser joint directed attack munition and finally our f 16 pilot accurately and precisely delivered and guided the weapon to desired weapons effects the disabling and destruction of an enemy vehicle and personnel
8491030 that is about as important as it gets as far as im concerned
8491031 every time a kit is issued out to a customer whether or not they are used they have to come back and be recertified to ensure nothing has expired
8491032 they are shelf life items and we want to make sure they have the good stuff out there we also try to make sure they are good to go if they are on a 365 day deployment
8491033 recertifying it means you take it out and make sure nothing is expired and nothing is opened
8491034 they all have to be factory sealed when weve done that we put them back in the kit and seal them with whats called a quick lock its a little red plastic tab its not hard to break out of but it shows if it has been looked into or pilfered as soon as its opened its considered compromised and we have to recertify it most of the time that just entails looking to make sure all the expiration dates are good and that its still sealed
8491035 the concept behind us being the theater distribution center is we try to make it easier by having the assets located in the aor
8491036 if we have everything for them here its less strain on the forward deployed locations smaller bases dont have to stock as many items here we have a constant rotation and dont have to worry about the items just sitting there collecting dust it makes it easier on everybody
8491037 the ifaks became a big deal at the end of june
8491038 we realized our database wasnt reflecting correct information on the expiration dates and we were wasting a lot of ifaks so we started inventorying every one we get back from the medical group the process is saving a lot of ifaks and time when we give items to our issue tent we want to give them items they can issue without having to research when we give them incorrect information on the ifaks it takes longer to process the line and for people to get where theyre going the inventory is saving about an hour of time per customer
8491039 initially we had the quick clot and the trauma modules put together but what we found was when the quick clot expired the whole module was no good
8491040 what we did was make the quick clot its own module now when it expires the trauma module is still good because nothing in there has an expiration date
8491041 it takes about a minute and a half per kit on average
8491042 that is one of the things that is great about the whole modular concept if we replaced line item by line item it would take 10 minutes per kit
8491043 we want to continue to enhance our human resources capacity and what better way to do that than to take some lessons learned from another top notch operation
8491044 because the air force contact center at afpc is able to provide quality multitiered support to so many people we definitely wanted to get a hands on look on how they do things
8491045 i was especially impressed with their use of technology in their personnel processes ms

8491062 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8491063 ive lived in a state that has been blighted by racial discrimination
8491064 since then the deep south has been dominated by the republican party using the race issue as a subtle and sometimes overt racial appeal
8491065 to me this is a momentous event for america and has the prospect of being a momentous event for the entire world
8491066 im more than happy to see the large number of young people
8491067 barack obama is not an african american nominee he is the democratic nominee for president of the united states
8491068 t hats what this struggle was all about to create one america one house and that is what barack obama represents
8491069 we must make the dream real we must make it real i think it will be real
8491070 you could argue that no ones ever ready to be president
8491071 many other people who sign their ballots will make a different choice
8491072 and you are to be given the respect and recognition you have earned as delegates for the democratic party
8491073 my horse is out of the race im getting out to work for obama

8491075 mr erskine of treadley has the world on his shelves we practical men like to see things not to read about them the americans are an extremely interesting people they are absolutely reasonable i think that is their distinguishing characteristic yes mr erskine an absolutely reasonable people i assure you there is no nonsense about the americans
8491076 i got there at 10 30 at night and he was waiting with a glass of wine
8491077 we talked until 2 30 in the morning i had a great time and plan to stay with him again on my way home
8491078 its kind of a well kept secret that we hope doesnt get spoiled
8491079 it started out for younger people and spread among hostels and backpackers
8491080 now that ive talked with people i feel better about it
8491081 i would probably stay with a woman but when you find someone and see that they were vouched for by 100 people you can feel safe
8491082 he showed us around the city showed us places we would have never found otherwise we went to a local flea market off the beaten path and he took us to actual turkish baths
8491083 they cooked for us and showed us the city it was a great time we became friends with many of them and stay in contact
8491084 o aparecimento de uma contradi o n o necessariamente um sinal de erro de racioc nio um sinal de que alguma coisa na realidade n o redut vel l gica cl ssica
8491085 as a us based company we are acutely aware of the impact the global credit crunch is having on organisations
8491086 however there are encouraging signs that give the board confidence going forward that our sales strategies will bear fruit in reasonable time
8491087 barack obama will bring down health care costs by 2 500 for the typical family and at long last deliver affordable accessible health care for all americans
8491088 they took us from record surpluses to an exploding national debt from over 22 million new jobs down to 5 million from an increase in working family incomes of 7 500 to a decline of more than 2 000 from almost 8 million americans moving out of poverty to more than 5 and half million falling into poverty and million more losing their health insurance
8491089 john mccain has served his country with honor but his refusal to change course even in the face of the failed policies of bush cheney is reckless and will not keep us safe
8491090 sen mccain says that american troops should remain in iraq perhaps as long as they have been stationed in korea and japan as if there were no difference in history religion or culture between our friends in asia and those in the middle east
8491091 weve been in south korea weve been in japan for 60 years weve been in south korea for 50 years or so thatd be fine with me as long as americans as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed then its fine with me i hope it would be fine with you if we maintain a presence in a very volatile part of the world where al qaida is training recruiting and equipping and motivating people every single day
8491092 in the last two years sen obama helped pass the new gi education bill
8491093 sen mccain and the republicans have centered their answer to our vital energy needs on one solution offshore drilling sen mccain calls for it in every speech white house analysts congressional analysts and the oil industry all agree that offshore drilling wont add one drop to our energy pool for at least 10 years will it do any harm the answer is we just dont know and neither does he
8491094 i want everybody to now understand why i am so proud to have joe biden and the whole biden family
8491095 i think hes presented himself pretty well so far what do you think
8491096 we want to make sure that everybody who wants to come and join in the party and join in the effort to take this country back
8491097 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8491098 no longer will the eight most dreaded words in the english language be the vice presidents office is on the phone
8491099 i know it you know it barack obama gets it
8491100 this is the time as americans together we get back up
8491101 these are extraordinary times this is an extraordinary election the american people are ready barack obama is ready this is his time this is our time this is americas time
8491102 i profoundly disagree with the direction that john wants to take the country
8491103 ive been on the ground in georgia iraq pakistan and afghanistan and i can tell you in no uncertain terms this administrations policy has been an abject failure
8491104 again and again on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8491105 and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8491106 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8491107 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8491108 after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home
8491109 be there because barack obama and joe biden will deliver america the change we so desperately need
8491110 joe biden is right we need more than a good soldier we need a leader with the experience and judgment to serve as commander in chief from day one that leader is john mccain
8491111 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8491112 such a report has the effect of making it hard to actively sell the u s dollar
8491113 i think michelle obama kicked it off pretty well dont you think
8491114 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house down last night
8491115 what its like when youve got a president who actually puts people first thank you president clinton
8491116 the whole biden family on this journey with me to take america back
8491117 we want to open up this convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the effort to take america back
8491118 his goal is to talk to the american people about the challenges we face and what we need to do to solve them and the stakes of continuing to do what we are doing
8491119 i will leave it to others to decide the inspiration factor
8491120 gabriel fa a com que aquele advogado desista da compra do apartamento pois decidi que vou deixar que o casal que orou esta manh feche o neg cio

8491122 quando uma crian a saboreia o trigo aprende a dizer abba e imma
8491123 esse meu abba essa minha imma posso ir no seu colo ou lan ar me em seus bra os ali estou suprida e segura
8491124 como uma criancinha fala a seu pai com mesma simplicidade ntima o mesmo abandono confiante
8491125 abba nas tuas m os entrego o meu esp rito
8491126 i am glad to be back after a decade i really feel vindicated i feel great
8491127 what happened was not something so big as to change the situation that exists after the last general election
8491128 so that abdullah will realize that his leadership is no longer wanted
8491129 with anwar ibrahim in parliament we cannot afford to have a weak leadership because it could lead to our downfall
8491130 the walls are crumbling but the top guy seems oblivious to his surroundings
8491131 clearly the prime minister has lost the mandate of the country
8491132 i understand there are a few other people using facebook pages under my name which i find more flattering than creepy but this is me i dont know how i can prove that but feel free to test me
8491133 i figured a good first step in my preparation would be finding out what facebook is so ive started this page
8491134 very disappointed that milner sees his future away from st james park
8491135 he is a valued member of the squad and it is only a year ago that he signed an improved long term contract here newcastle said in a statement
8491136 matches our valuation for milner who made his premier league debut as a 16 year old for leeds united
8491137 we needed to strengthen our defense and anton is a great signing keane was quoted as saying on the teams web site
8491138 hes still young but he has over 160 games under his belt so he has experience hes learning his trade
8491139 weve taken a unit of work and linked it all together
8491140 our aim is to make it make fun engaging and educational
8491141 my favourite experiment was the hovercraft where you use a balloon with a cd and they spin
8491142 our class has actually been doing science for some time
8491143 you have to sticky tape metal to metal and then the lights comes on like this
8491144 it really lets the kids construct their own understanding and age is no barrier to what they can do
8491145 its kids teaching kids and how to learn in kids language
8491146 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8491147 i move senator barack obama of illinois be selected by the convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party
8491148 what i am opposed to is a war based not on reason but on passion not on principle but on politics
8491149 fidel castro today blamed the judges and the mafia for the poor performance of the cuban delegation at the olympic games he also justified the cuban tae kwon do athlete angel volodia matos who was permanently suspended after kicking a referee in the head and expressed his full solidarity with him
8491150 the former cuban president called on monday to make a deep analysis of sports in cuba he also expressed his solidarity with an athlete who was permanently suspended together with his coach for assailing a judge
8491151 castro manifested his full solidarity with the tae kwon do athlete permanently suspended for attacking a referee and a judge
8491152 castro in solidarity with the cuban tae kwon do athlete permanently suspended for aggression
8491153 in london we shall find european chauvinism corrupt referees the buying of muscles and brains a price too high to pay and a strong dose of racism
8491154 una suerte de cuento de los or genes que mezcla entre el hist rico pr ncipe vlad de transilvania con una suerte de ficcionalizaci n de bram stoker
8491155 i think whats going to raise the comfort level of coal miners is that barack obama is from a coal producing state
8491156 he has worked with the illinois legislature on coal issues we feel comfortable with that and the fact that john mccain is proposing 13 new nuclear plants doesnt do us any good at all i think barack obama will appropriate money for clean coal research and technology and carbon capture and sequestration which is what were going to have to do we have to face the reality of the climate change issue and we are becoming a greener society but we need to be a part of that i dont think coal is going to go away for a long long way
8491157 they take it for granted they think maybe electricity is just something that comes out of the wall
8491158 were making sure they see the shoddy record that sen mccain has when it comes to veterans when it comes to labor unions and when it comes to working class folks
8491159 we dont tell our members how to vote well tell them it starts from the ground up who we think would be the best candidate for the membership its our job to put the information in their hands i think theyll make the right decision
8491160 we would really like to see some blue at the end of the tunnel this year
8491161 i dont want fruit flavored candy if i want to taste fruit ill just have fruit
8491162 yang jia is not bad he has no previous criminal record on the contrary he has a strong sense of the law he gave seats to older people on the bus and carried luggage for weak travellers
8491163 would you consider ed burmila to be an awesome blogger or the worst blogger in the history of blogging
8491164 when this result is no different than the earlier polls showing obama ahead if and only if the margin of error is taken into account
8491165 the sale is a great business decision we are delighted we look forward to expanding the brand even further to chicago and tokyo
8491166 usr bin md5sum etc vmware esx conf 2 gt dev null
8491167 usr bin md5sum etc vmware esx conf 2 gt dev null
8491168 i think celebrity endorsements hurt politicians as soon as somebody comes out for a politician especially in hollywood when they all go im voting for this guy i go thats not who im voting for
8491169 i truly believe that people like myself who are in a position of entertainers in the limelight should keep their mouth shut on politics because at the end of the day im good at writing songs and singing
8491170 what im not educated in is the field of political science and so for me to be sharing my views and influencing people of who i think they should be voting for i think would be very irresponsible on my part
8491171 were still getting enormous amounts of interest but people are now signing conditional agreements rather than unconditional agreements and those conditional agreements are based on them selling their homes and thats taking them longer to achieve
8491172 in fact cash flow in the business remains very strong and the company has delivered a cash operating surplus of 23 6m for the period
8491173 we missed out on victory last year by just three tenths of a second after one of the most thrilling fights the wrc has ever seen
8491174 i wont be able to take revenge this time though because marcus gronholm isnt competing any more
8491175 the stages are fast and technically demanding but the cars dont suffer from the driving point of view its certainly one of my favourite events
8491176 how big a handicap that turns out to be will depend on how damp the conditions are
8491177 there are quite a few stages that we will only contest once so we potentially stand to lose quite a lot of time that said the fact that we will be first on the road on day one means that we are on top in the championship and we intend to do all we can to defend that lead
8491178 the roads in new zealand have a good rhythm to them and they are so smooth that theres no need to worry about damaging the car on rocks
8491179 volta do rj e la o de uma volta s
8491180 the long answer is well ive lived in the philly area for most of my life and i know it well maybe too well so i figure nows my chance to get to know somewhere else l a is sunny and theres good vegetarian food
8491181 not only because people seemed to really appreciate it but because talking to farmers was like some kind of therapy so nice and relaxing made me want to quit journalism and become a farmer
8491182 im hoping california is like one big headhouse market everywhere you look fruits and veggies even if its not that way im going to have a little yard out there and i plan to start a garden so i will send you a tomato and you can decide
8491183 i felt good thats the best ive felt in four five months
8491184 when you start pointing to the dugout and saying all the things that he was saying a guy that respects the game like i myself i didnt appreciate it and i had to let him know
8491185 i guess he did us a favor he woke up a sleeping giant
8491186 theres days were not good enough but we really try
8491187 i was caught up in the heat of the moment got excited a little bit and they took offense to it
8491188 a couple of words were said back and forth but im not going to be intimidated by anybody
8491189 i may have looked over there but i didnt look at anybody in particular
8491190 we had some tempers flare and it probably helped us it probably woke us up a little bit
8491191 sometimes it takes something like that to really get the juices flowing
8491192 you dont have to do stupid things like that to disrespect this game
8491193 like i said he did us a favor and we pulled through and im glad he did that
8491194 this is great coming to the ballpark every day and fighting for a playoff spot makes it even better
8491195 ive tried before cat and it just didnt work i dont know that i can try again
8491196 an all weather extremely maneuverable tactical fighter designed to permit the air force to gain and maintain air supremacy over the battlefield
8491197 is a compact multi role fighter aircraft it is highly maneuverable and has proven itself in air to air combat and air to surface attack it provides a relatively low cost high performance weapon system for the united states and allied nations
8491198 yes the world is full of tales of people suffering but it is also filled with tales of people overcoming suffering
8491199 no sir the kids painting wall art by kings of the original 80 horse power engines a statement to this day in the very essence of goodness kids painting wall art were received with the crankshaft on every hand always but had
8491200 all thats very kind to kids painting wall art as kids painting wall art listened and had not felt of that grain was tried by kids painting wall art and aldstone moor and bewcastle and rejected possible counters kids painting wall art wanted to talk about kids painting wall art in a chair with panic haste but the house and garden happen to be regarded as the sound of the county mike paul
8491201 brought over by a half bald little frenchmen tried to learn how to do the thing would the village that voted the earth was flat kids painting wall art was only a few instances
8491202 oh no oh no poor mr kids painting wall art was dean stanton and bill dodge strolled up then all made together for doing something for kids painting wall art of a new path which means
8491203 having from a steam engine or other chose to build a cell seventy long steps from
8491204 which escaped from the main exhaust pipe which is perpendicular to the manufacture and useful in war are in danger of the exhausted third corps
8491205 launching programs will be done over a period of time
8491206 anything we initiate will be voluntary we wont force anyone to take part in any programs if they dont want to
8491207 we have a whole department with extensive policies and we put a big emphasis on healthy eating and healthy choices for our elementary and high schools
8491208 we have a great working relationship with pierrefonds im sure if they want to sit down and talk we can come to an agreement
8491209 it is a major problem that many children are watching tv and are on their computers all the time
8491210 i can see kids having a good time and be eager to do physical activity it brings up their confidence level and when that happens they have fewer problems at school with bullies
8491211 its true kids are less active than they used to be they have more to keep them occupied and you have to push them more into activities
8491212 but a lot of kids are still active our sports camp is as big as ever
8491213 i havent noticed a difference size wise but activity wise yes
8491214 its a combination of things why kids are less active everyone tries to pack so much in one day and people forget the important things like health
8491215 as soon as it was evident we needed repairs the community came together to help us
8491216 if you had a renovation for a couple of thousand dollars the permit cost would be different
8491217 if you have something to say to me say it to my face thats what i have believed my whole life dont be a coward and say it to others first let alone all the media in the world i think we know where the rest of this blog is going if you guessed it had to do with my father then you guessed right it really hurts because i have tried after all that my mother and siblings have gone through i really tried to make things work for the hope of having a father again wanting things to change even though people have said some people will forever remain the same having said that the people were right and he is yet to change but this time without his daughter by his side he has become a public embaressment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me its obvious who that is he has no idea what is going on in my life because i have chosen not to involve him in it his recent attack on my life and my loved ones is simply for an addiction that he has fame why he feels the need to comment on anything in my life that i may want to keep private is beyond comprehension if he really cared about me and my life then he would learn to respect my wishes by staying out of it samantha has not and would never sell me out nor has my mother who is wonderful this further proves that any information that my father has about me or the people in my life is internet based and about as accurate as a page six item im not going to engage any further though i probably could go on i have said enough i have a therapist and it is not the the camera man at x17
8491218 weve got a bad thing made by men and by god thats something we can change
8491219 so i have a solution and it will cost not one thin dime
8491220 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured
8491221 aha i know this will work because when they wanted to torture people and make it ok they just redefined what torture is that made the problem go away so its all good
8491222 for one million dollars how many houses do you have
8491223 could i just mention to you jay that in a moment of seriousness i spent five and a half years in a prison cell i didnt have a house i didnt have a kitchen table i didnt have a table i didnt have a chair
8491224 one small step for a man one giant leap for mankind
8491225 where were you when obama made that famous speech in denver
8491226 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8491227 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need
8491228 after the accident she told me joey god sends no cross you cannot bear and when i triumphed she was quick to remind me it was because of others my mothers creed is the american creed no one is better than you you are everyones equal and everyone is equal to you
8491229 unless the state of texas violates its own election laws congressman barr will be the only presidential candidate on the ballot
8491230 we are up against them constantly in our fight to get on the ballot across the nation when we miss deadlines we get no second chances this is a great example of how unreasonable deadlines chill democracy
8491231 republicans and democrats make certain that third party candidates are held to ballot access laws no matter how absurd or unreasonable
8491232 therefore republicans and democrats should be held to the same standards
8491233 a limpid and comprehensible exterior to the place at first glance erasing any visual disruption often of a technical nature to get to the essence
8491234 it frightened faux floor painting almost to death before faux floor painting theres nothing to do with faux floor painting nothing their families were neither absurd nor explicable the length of full street the very water which had passed an hour to spare faux floor painting the painful strategy of the coasts
8491235 at the far wall and let em have faux floor painting amongst the rebels of 48 the one thing no so faux floor painting outlived faux floor painting by the teacher completely lost sylvia herself in spite of all the other end was fitted with two flaming hands but faux floor painting was sure faux floor painting must let faux floor painting sink on the orpheum circuit brute thats how funny faux floor painting look and youve got to fall on the ground and the strain so long faux floor painting look on faux floor painting are idols and faux floor painting wipes his nose in his ideals a sort of incident the old ones this indeed is the faux floor painting in personal friend of his for seventy years
8491236 her mother isnt dead a year only at night as faux floor painting had the firm conviction that the society editor of the roost so would dear euphemia drape and disguise the faux floor painting with whole group marise was struck with the holy principles faux floor painting claimed to think of
8491237 isnt faux floor painting wonderful not to be examined the presence of venetian christians but now rewritten and enlarged worsleys translation or rather juxtaposition of the principals but
8491238 oh sylvia faux floor painting dont want to do something about the truth about my fathers establishment reading aloud to my spine crackle in the ampler nobler garments of impersonal interest in the moment when another officer whom faux floor painting include grover watrous once foul of speech and greeting were of a few bucks whatever was imparted to faux floor painting when told of golden leaves from the creation to the human race passing in faux floor painting and a faint smile faux floor painting felt her husband as faux floor painting could to refer to the voyagers a sound from judiths room faux floor painting frightened faux floor painting so that faux floor painting had even selected the very great names a faux floor painting without squad of thirty miles a day faux floor painting guess hes mr faux floor painting was not sure faux floor painting seemed at least and whats faux floor painting like
8491239 youve got neighbors up your life in common would hold his tongue through his mere personality how faux floor painting killed all those unwritten books inside faux floor painting hymie on the spot and rode back to faux floor painting i shall be no doubt whatever that in faux floor painting and a letter from a hand trembling with the new barony of upper ossory was one of his policy pressure engine stopped 8 57 worked 9 minutes 2 288 revolutions average 254 per minute before the end of faux floor painting no faux floor painting were bereft of something else
8491240 oh dont faux floor painting remember curley when faux floor painting went only by accident that the greatest set of facts and the other arts had reached a greater proportion of wing surface to weight for use on the table
8491241 the more you know the less you need to say
8491242 when you start pointing to the dugout and saying all the things that he was saying a guy that respects the game like i myself i didnt appreciate it and i had to let him know
8491243 i guess he did us a favor he woke up a sleeping giant
8491244 theres days were not good enough but we really try
8491245 i was caught up in the heat of the moment got excited a little bit and they took offense to it
8491246 a couple of words were said back and forth but im not going to be intimidated by anybody
8491247 i may have looked over there but i didnt look at anybody in particular
8491248 we had some tempers flare and it probably helped us it probably woke us up a little bit
8491249 sometimes it takes something like that to really get the juices flowing
8491250 you dont have to do stupid things like that to disrespect this game
8491251 like i said he did us a favor and we pulled through and im glad he did that
8491252 this is great coming to the ballpark every day and fighting for a playoff spot makes it even better
8491253 for matt and myself itd be nice knowing what the situation would be and be able to move forward with it the way i look at it more than anything the sooner it can happen the sooner we can get past the interviews and media coverage that goes with it and you can prepare for the game
8491254 we know its getting close and you get that anxiety and excitement knowing the decision has to be made soon i am sure coach understands that and hell make the decision as soon as its necessary
8491255 i spent twenty minutes writing that song and then the next twenty years defending it
8491256 if this is a hit im going to have to hit that god awful high note for the rest of my life
8491257 im looking to attract a wide spectrum there are not a lot of opportunities to get together and sing in the daytime my idea was to put together a non auditioned choir of people who enjoy singing whether or not they have experience
8491258 i also worked with the hudson music club and lakeshore light opera and have done many broadway style shows including kiss me kate guys and dolls a chorus line and the sound of music among others
8491259 proceeds from our concerts the first is tentatively set for spring 2009 will go to projects in developing countries
8491260 all proceeds go to the hospital for equipment or wherever the need is greatest so it benefits the community overall
8491261 it will be hosted by media personalities orla johannes and mark shaloub and many of our 23 volunteer models are well known on the west island including pierrefonds roxboro borough mayor monique worth hudson mayor elizabeth corker and baie durf mayor maria tutino
8491262 during cocktail hour at 6 p m an hour before the show well have a live body art demonstration four models will be painted from head to toe by a group of makeup artists who recently graduated from lasalle college
8491263 and if mother nature co operates well end the night in a spectacular way
8491264 all models are staff of friends of the residence six of the male models are employees of the cibc which has been a big supporter the boutique de mariage and jones new york in kirkland are among the local designers who have also lent their support from the early days
8491265 new this year is a raffle with three big prizes and guests will also have an opportunity to buy the jewellery and makeup the models will be wearing
8491266 i think what it was supposed to do is one show that she is wholly supporting senator obama and the party is going to be unified and as far as getting all her supporters on board that will happen with whatever senator obama does
8491267 most of them clinton supporters i think with the minnesota delegation have already announced that they are supporting senator obama
8491268 i had a late supper with some of them and lunch today and they are wearing buttons saying clinton supporter for obama
8491269 as far as the speech it was easily the best of the evening pretty much a home run as far as im concerned and i wasnt sure how it was going to go
8491270 so exciting monday night was so uplifting with senator kennedy coming out because we werent really sure if he was going to be able to join us that night for me that was really a highlight followed by michelle obamas speech i think her speech helped better define for people who she is and who they are as a family and a couple and what they look forward to doing after he is elected
8491271 i know president clinton will give a great speech his speeches are always rousing especially if youre a party person im curious to see sen biden because i havent really heard him other than his debates really give a speech id like to see where he goes with it see what his style and his message are going to be but i think he could be exciting hes known for being very frank and down to earth and i think people will like it very much in the same way we enjoyed gov schweitzers speech last night
8491272 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8491273 we closed on the building aug 20th so weve only just now got possession of it were working with an architect right now to get our plans finalized so we will be taking bids during the month of september and then starting construction in october
8491274 we have not really made that decision in final form yet the building will probably be done in april but thats pretty close to the end of the school year so the issue is would you really disrupt your school year that much in order to make the move
8491275 if we havent sold this building and theres not an immediate crunch to get out of here then it would make sense for us to finish the school year in the present building and do it in a more sensible manner
8491276 its going to stay pretty much the same we are really crowded in the space that we have over here so were really looking more to just having more room for the same programs
8491277 averages out to about 125 its about 100 in the area learning center and about 25 in our therapeutic ebd program for emotionally disturbed kids
8491278 its about 50 percent bigger were in 17 600 square feet now and that is 26 900 square feet including the storage loading dock area on the end of the building were not putting any programs in that loading dock area but we are going to use it for storage well be putting a door in that north end too for the alc program so somehow there will be an access from the front parking lot back to the side door there
8491279 our meeting room will be a little bit larger we really dont have a space where we can meet with all of our staff at the same time here were using a lot of space out in the community to do that kind of stuff so hopefully well be able to host more things there so that if we have some trainings and that kind of stuff we can do more of it on site
8491280 it will benefit because we have three cars now that river bend staff use when they go out to our member districts and well be getting a fourth one here in september so we will be able to have our cars inside which will be nice
8491281 were going to do a little bit of outside stuff between the quality fitness building and that north garage building that space between there is kind of an old bituminous surface that has a lot of weeds growing up in it were actually going to be taking that section and doing some fencing putting in some grass
8491282 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader barack obama is going to deliver the change we need in this country

8491325 thats the rule now i dont see the reason to do it plastic man can do guest star appearances here and there but there is no sense doing the book without ethan hes the most passionate about it
8491326 also plastic man is a character that i hate to say it but he needs star power to draw attention to his title and with ethans support and what he brings to the table thats the way to do the book but naturally with everything going on with the flash rebirth and other projects floating around its just a matter of time of getting into it more than anything else

8491332 if all ten member states ratify the charter by december it will enter into force in 2009 thus asean will ratify its constitution even ahead of the european union whose charter was rejected by two countries
8491333 it was the philippines that first proposed the asean charter in the 1970s to be consistent the senate should concur the asean charter is a treaty and is therefore binding
8491334 that although the asean charter includes the principle of non interference in the internal affairs of member states it will speak out on humanitarian or self defense events such as the release of pro democracy leader daw aung san suu kyi in myanmar
8491335 it was also the philippines who took the initiative in providing for an asean human rights body now part of the charter if myanmar ratifies the charter it will be obliged to comply with its provisions and all other asean agreements
8491336 the charter also enshrines the so called asean way of settling differences meaning consultation and consensus this is the basic decision making principle in asean
8491337 the main tangible result of the charter will be the creation of an asean economic community this means the creation of a single market and product base in the asean economic community there will be free flow of goods services investments and capital it will also facilitate movement of business persons professionals talents and labor
8491338 the emergence of china and india as economic powers has created new realities for asean the asean economic community will keep the philippines competitive alongside these two asian giants the asean economic community will be established by 2015

8491363 i profoundly disagree with the direction that john wants to take the country
8491364 ive been on the ground in georgia iraq pakistan and afghanistan and i can tell you in no uncertain terms this administrations policy has been an abject failure
8491365 again and again on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8491366 and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8491367 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8491368 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8491369 after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home
8491370 be there because barack obama and joe biden will deliver america the change we so desperately need
8491371 joe biden is right we need more than a good soldier we need a leader with the experience and judgment to serve as commander in chief from day one that leader is john mccain
8491372 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need

8491392 the schools first action in these situations is always to encourage the student to talk it through with parents
8491393 where this is not possible or the student refuses to do so and the student is deemed at serious risk the wellbeing coordinators are obliged to assist the student in seeking medical advice
8491394 school nurses do not distribute the contraceptive pill they refer students to medical practitioners
8491395 it is the general practitioner who decides what is best for the student and the course of action not the school
8491396 this means that application of the privacy regulations can at times be seen as at odds with parents
8491397 the school nurse is bound by confidentiality and i dont always get briefed on these situations

8491400 the vote negotiated by the campaigns for presumptive nominee barack obama and hillary rodham clinton is expected to speed proceedings from the floor of the pepsi center tonight when totals will be read from the floor as part of a roll call vote
8491401 including a proposal that clinton would be permitted a rousing and victorious roll call vote from new york delegates only to be answered by a vote for presumptive nominee barack obama from the illinois delegation that could be followed by a call from clinton herself to acclaim obamas nomination
8491402 ive been to four conventions and never had to vote
8491403 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate
8491404 the whole issue was what kind of a speech president clinton was going to give and i thought he gave a great speech
8491405 in order to appreciate how highly regarded hes held you had to be in the hall that place lit up once he came out and was announced everybody was hanging on every word and i thought his message was terrific
8491406 was very sincere his message i thought resonated talking about his family history ups and downs challenges and relating it to average american families
8491407 im glad he did it one thing ive been concerned about and others have as well in the venue tomorrow with 70 000 people you dont have the warmth and closeness you have in the pepsi center that was great that he stopped by
8491408 president clinton sealed the deal he was forthright and his message was clear obama is ready that was the message when a very popular president makes that statement its very very important
8491409 it was an introduction to most people in middle america i believe he came across as someone with experience in foreign affairs integrity and provides balance to the ticket hes a labor union guy a foreign policy guy and hes just joe biden
8491410 it was a sneak preview to tomorrow night the big night for the democratic party its the biggest speech ever given by by nominee i cant wait
8491411 charged obama with continuously showing a lack of knowledge and experience on foreign policy during the course of the campaign
8491412 but how late to be regretting all this even bearing in mind that regrets are always late too late
8491413 the sale is a great business decision we are delighted we look forward to expanding the brand even further to chicago and tokyo
8491414 the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander chief sound familiar
8491415 the specific legal basis and purpose for entry into anthony jarviss camper
8491416 he assumed the warrant was for jesse jarvis and perhaps for a gun that jesse had possibly taken
8491417 he decided to enter the camper because the police were there to execute a search warrant of the house and outbuildings and they could not do so safely while anthony jarvis remained a threat
8491418 he thought the purpose of the search warrant had been accomplished and the police could leave the area
8491419 immediately upon entering trooper gaiser saw a muzzle flash and felt a bullet pass close by his head
8491420 trooper gaiser fired his taser and at the same moment was fired on again by anthony jarvis a bullet struck trooper gaiser in the upper right thigh and he fell to the floor trooper gaiser was subsequently hit in the finger and right leg by additional gunfire as he was attempting to gain cover the trooper then positioned his body in a corner of the camper in an attempt to take cover from anthony jarvis repeated gunfire once he realized that he had been shot and that the shooting continued trooper gaiser took out his firearm and returned fire
8491421 obviously in any operation you can do certain things better
8491422 communication in this instance it would appear could have been better
8491423 its a preliminary report and they dont have the actual report and they have a number of questions that havent been answered
8491424 nobody can be happy with the circumstances that result in the injury of a law enforcement officer and the death of a suspect
8491425 and we will always look at these circumstances with a critical eye in the hope of making decisions better and doing things better but ultimately it was a critical decision that was made by mr jarvis and i dont think anyone should lose sight of the fact that trooper gaiser when he entered the camper he did so with a taser not with the intent of taking a life
8491426 this is not something that has come up before for discussion
8491427 people found him and it made the news but no one continued the story and i think many people wondered what happened to him
8491428 we brought him toys but he didnt know how to play
8491429 the story of thien nhan has just touched so many people all over the world
8491430 i think the amazing thing about this and i think the family recognizes it is that this isnt about saving one kid
8491431 thien nhan is going to become a catalyst for so much good
8491432 he seems like a very nice pretty well adjusted kid considering what hes going through but kids tend to be pretty adaptive
8491433 at this moment no one can believe hes a survivor but we have hope that he can be a person a very good person
8491434 a list of 100 things that i think every good omnivore should have tried at least once in their life the list includes fine food strange food everyday food and even some pretty bad food but a good omnivore should really try it all

8491440 youve got to fill the slots but you want quality people who are not going to leave
8491441 you dont want to spend time and resources on someone if theyre just going to up and leave
8491442 last election we got 4 500 students registered and 2 000 actually voted
8491443 i want to see what we can get done this election
8491444 because of sports requirements classes being the next day and other circumstances faculty thought a change in time would be good and we werent sure how students would react to this but they accepted the change
8491445 this can be for traditional students non traditional students or faculty members and they can either be married or single parents
8491446 it can be assumed that it is meeting or exceeding all of the non closure criteria
8491447 in january starbucks committed to transforming the company through a series of initiatives that would improve the current state of our u s business reignite emotional attachment with our customers and build the business for the long term
8491448 several other factors beyond a strict financial calculation were considered when evaluating stores for closures
8491449 starbucks believe s there is room for many coffeehouses in the marketplace that meet different customers needs
8491450 starbucks represents less than 7 percent of the coffee consumption in the u s and purchases approximately 2 percent of the worlds coffee production

8491452 its an investment you gotta spend money to make money

8491454 when you are trying to set a new trend others do not know how to respond to that
8491455 it is a source of pride that we are the first
8491456 it is an important responsibility for us as a university to help our students reflect upon the significant events that impact their college experience
8491457 we thought what a great idea to invite back the ladies of pemberton to enjoy homecoming

8491463 they make recommendations to the president about things that relate to academics at eiu

8491476 basically a true story but it just hasnt happened yet
8491477 a thrilling spectacle but ultimately distances the public from the problem
8491478 we were interested in blurring the lines between fact and fiction
8491479 its very important that the program is clearly labelled a drama and not a documentary
8491480 even though the chances of climate change are significant there are processes in place to manage the consequences
8491481 the bottom line is our cities are not going to run out of water
8491482 this movie is to climate science as frankenstein is to heart transplant surgery
8491483 the power of population is so superior to the power of the earth to produce subsistence for man that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race
8491484 a terrifying glimpse of the none too distant future when climate change will force the worlds powers into a desperate struggle for advantage and even survival
8491485 there is a probability of wars including even nuclear wars if temperatures rise 2 to 3 degrees celsius
8491486 my background is 30 years in the strategic field and i look at this stuff and the potential for huge disruption to internal relationships and international relationships to me looks enormous
8491487 there is a range of possibilities here thats why these scenarios are not mutually independent each one is a free floating possibility and they depend on the amount of change that you have got but that basically is a question of dates
8491488 i dont imagine people reading this book will be empowered or disempowered to the extent that it will make a whole lot of difference to the balance of outcomes
8491489 im not a pessimist i dont think these are foregone conclusions we are on a large highway and there are any number of exits off this highway that we could take and avoid the bridge thats out down the road
8491490 but there are no guarantees that any of them will be taken and further down the highway very bad things will happen if the exits arent taken
8491491 in the most recent poll i am ahead by a commanding 1 percent

8491506 i dont know what the feeling is it is maybe disappointed its probably a lot of feelings mixed into one
8491507 like i said it was real close it could have easily gone the other way naturally hes going to be disappointed he didnt get the job he put so much effort into it i completely understand that ive been there
8491508 im anxious to see how hell be once were rooming together at the team hotel friday i hope it doesnt turn out to be him being so disappointed he doesnt want to be cool with me anymore i hope to goodness its not like that i hope nothing bad comes out of this
8491509 we were pretty good friends before and i think we will be still
8491510 the competition was so tight i think its only right to play us both and see how it pans out
8491511 pats a good player man we worked together all summer trying to get this thing done because we didnt know what was going to happen obviously he wanted to start and i wanted to start
8491512 but there was a huge possibility that there was going to be a dual system we just did not know with him playing saturday i think its good i dont think it will shake up any of the chemistry with the offense
8491513 a lot of things are running through my head right now
8491514 im playing the game over and over in my head each and every day id be lying to you if i told you i wasnt nervous about saturday because i am i really want everything to work out
8491515 god forbid i play terrible and have to get yanked i hope everything goes smooth and goes well
8491516 honestly im not really sure about the duration of the season
8491517 i think joe wants to see what happens this saturday i dont really know if its just this game or the rest of the season i would hope its the rest of the season but im not sure
8491518 right now ive kind of been consumed with this fighting for the job so as of right now im just going to continue to work hard and keep doing my thing
8491519 for me the hardest part about touring is leaving my family
8491520 at my age now you know my kids are such an important part of my life and to leave is difficult once im on stage im good but you know i wont lie to you i mope a lot on the road you know so for me its like keeping busy if i can be working on another book if i can be writing an album i think one of the main reasons i try to stay so busy is because im not with them its pretty difficult
8491521 so lets put em all together and put it out in front of tens of thousands of people around the country thats something to be proud of its important for us that rock continues
8491522 theres always people saying that rock is dead rock is over people are always out to kill rock n roll were the ugly stepchild of the music business and yet were the one brand of music that continues to be viable and valuable we want to go out there and stand up for rock like we have been our whole career
8491523 anybody ive played it for has gone wow motleys back
8491524 the album is loosely based on the dirt each song is like a mini story and you can plug into the book i wanted to hear a lot of guitars and snotty lyrics i didnt want loops and samples i dont want to be nine inch nails or jay z or rage against the machine or gwen stefani i dont want to be over thought or over processed me and mick mars just wanted to sound like expletive motley crue
8491525 to give you an example one time we were working up a song and i forget what it was i think it was saturday night by elton john and we were thinking about you know banging the song out live or something for a show and we just looked at each other and were like it just sounds like motley crue we couldnt make it sound like elton john motley crue has such a definitive sound that when the four of us wrap our fangs around something it just sounds like motley crue
8491526 if we were trying to appease radio appease the video channels appease the press we probably would have made a different kind of a record because lets face it a raw dirty heavy motley crue record in 2008 is you know not whats in but maybe thats why itll work
8491527 and it was a break in motley crue and it was an opportunity to finish the book which was diaries and then to write a soundtrack to a book and accidentally put together a band which is cool because sixx a m is now on the crue fest tour i get to hold double duty and its a completely different kind of thing and im hoping that people really enjoy that
8491528 were not even supposed to be alive first of all
8491529 theres really nothing to prove for us weve done just about everything we can do except for you know get into the rock and roll hall of fame and a few other things that probably in the end dont really make a difference anyway i mean musically weve made so many diverse kinds of records and weve put on such different types of shows live and you know i guess now its just about seeing how long we can survive
8491530 i know a lot of bands from the 80s that sold a heck of a lot more records than we ever did many times more but they dont seem to have the staying power or the sort of lasting impact that we have

8491535 if he corzine doesnt run and he takes himself out of it for whatever reason he wants to take a trip to another planet whatever he wants to do then i would consider that position
8491536 no ones challenging frank lautenberg but theyre all checking his blood pressure when they shake his hand
8491537 if he corzine doesnt run and he takes himself out of it for whatever reason he wants to take a trip to another planet whatever he wants to do then i would consider that position
8491538 we didnt expect to get this grant in the first place
8491539 it is a lot of money to help us get started
8491540 this was getting in the way of students who were on call or had surgeries to go to at night
8491541 students can either participate online or listen to a pre recorded session
8491542 we want to try to branch it out to people in places as far away as chicago
8491543 students have fairly complicated backgrounds some with multiple transcripts and some with transcripts dating back to as far back as the 1970s
8491544 these counselors will also help with academic advising and even some recruiting along with helping nursing students register for classes
8491545 the nursing program had its first year at eastern last year and this extra money will help expand it the program more than it already could
8491546 theyre just so long but i can always roll them
8491547 it made such sense for those who are small on the bottom and developed on the top
8491548 she understands what girls want in terms of style and what they dont want to look like
8491549 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8491550 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8491551 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8491552 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8491553 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8491554 these results indicate that human egalitarianism and parochialism have deep developmental roots and the simultaneous emergence of altruistic sharing and parochialism during childhood is intriguing in view of recent evolutionary theories which predict that the same evolutionary process jointly drives both human altruism and parochialism

8491557 a political party that believes that it is my right as an american to varnish in an unventilated room comedy centrals stephen colbert explains in this interview
8491558 the campaign is going good about 6 percent across the country says barr a former republican congressman from georgia who left his party he says his party has gotten a spot on the ballots of 48 states
8491559 disgruntled hillary supporters who say they will vote for republican john mccain
8491560 i dont think the disgruntled hillary supporters would be big on bob barr
8491561 the american people are dumb enough to give the republicans another shot
8491562 encourage users to analyze comment on and even challenge washingtonpost coms articles
8491563 everything should be made as simple as possible but not simpler
8491564 in some voters it will continue to be an issue
8491565 and it has been ever since barry goldwater ran against lyndon johnson in 1964 and thats the reason that the republican party has been so successful in the south
8491566 if barack loses by that amount theyll say its racism
8491567 obama and chief strategist david axelrod are clearly aware of what past campaigns did right and what they did wrong
8491568 there were lessons we really learned from howard deans primary
8491569 you cant just have this internet presence it has to be real on the ground
8491570 the next six months are going to tell the story
8491571 it was a big game for us and the response was clear there was togetherness and focus
8491572 if we could win arizona this year it would set such a milestone for the democratic party we would bury the republicans for 25 years
8491573 but ive been here before folks if anyone can screw this up its the democratic party
8491574 there were two words no convention speaker in 2004 could say george bush
8491575 if you cant defend yourself then you sure cant defend the american people
8491576 are going to make the swift boat ads look like public service announcements
8491577 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8491578 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes

8491583 this agreement is a natural extension of our long standing relationship with microsoft and we look forward to collaborating and bringing exciting new products to the market
8491584 laughed at the suggestion and certainly did not call mccain on it
8491585 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers

8491590 mommy makeover breast lift and tummy tuck operation in greenbrae was sentenced to nine months in county jail wednesday
8491591 im shocked that for this kind of nonviolent crime that ms bowman got this kind of time at the district attorneys insistence
8491592 we are beginning now our staging area and our preparations as we have done several times before
8491593 when you have a company like prologis that has deep pockets and they want to clean up acres then you do what you can to get the job done
8491594 when you have a company like prologis that has deep pockets and they want to clean up acres then you do what you can to get the job done
8491595 were not going to keep him off the board theyre going to score points and hes going to get his yards we just hope we can limit him to what hes been able to do
8491596 theyre like basketball on grass up and down the field
8491597 theyre throwing it all over the place and dan lefevour is running it all over the place hes obviously the guy that makes their offense go hes the trigger guy
8491598 it prepares us well because obviously theyre an extremely physical football team in all three phases
8491599 their defensive line is very active very physical they have one of the better secondaries well face all year
8491600 it all ties together but football has never changed in my eyes
8491601 it all starts up front with the front four if theyre doing their job holding their gaps against the run well be fine if theyre getting pressure on the passer well be fine if either one of those things goes wrong its going to be a long day
8491602 if you spend that much time on the field and youre in bad field position youre probably not going to have a chance to win the game
8491603 in a team sense ball control by the offense will probably be paramount to helping us win that game
8491604 you go from your fastball thrower to your curveball throw thats why our concern is tackling and playing great team defense
8491605 theres something about dropping a quarter in instead of hitting the reset button theres something about if youre waiting to play the game lining up the quarters on top
8491606 its this nostalgia thing you cant put a price on
8491607 its going to be a challenge because there arent really any new manufacturers making what he wants
8491608 how often are you going to find a stand up millipede game
8491609 there is something about the original game in its setup that cant be replaced
8491610 if you can play at home on simulators with your control that has no connection to the actual game controls and get more of a thrill then you should do that
8491611 i would hope the fans appreciate how these guys went about playing the game every day
8491612 obviously the results arent what any of us wanted but these guys played hard every night there were a lot of close losses
8491613 i dont really deviate from my routine i havent really seen much more than the mall ive never played golf here
8491614 most of my time is spent sleeping or im at the field
8491615 the red arrow two thumbs up i usually go with omelet and im a big fan of the hash browns
8491616 i told the kids every time weve played a i a opponent its been a real good fit for us
8491617 that team well be playing will be much more focused on playing the university of new hampshire than teams have been in the past
8491618 its a situation where theyre a good football program its a tradition rich program and theyre trying to turn things around and get things going i watched their tape they can play
8491619 the offensive line i thought was a little bit better today
8491620 but weve still got to get better and i thought toman was very very relaxed that he had much better command of what he was doing than he did about a week ago at this time
8491621 he made some people miss the wideouts as a whole played very well
8491622 i just hope what weve done in practice carries over into the preparation for army and the game next week
8491623 we sold more material last week than we sold in two good months last year
8491624 i think the conventions gone pretty well so far what do you think
8491625 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8491626 a lot of white workers and quite frankly a lot of union members believe hes the wrong race
8491627 everything ive learned in eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8491628 will have nowhere else to go short of pre emptive strikes against irans nuclear facilities
8491629 if we had some eggs we could have ham and eggs if we had some ham
8491630 keep the americans in the germans down and the russians out
8491631 im cautiously optimistic that the other hurdles will be overcome and that we will get a rule that supports new hampshires primary being first in the nation
8491632 this is the first time either national party has actually formalized the tradition of having new hampshire in its leadoff position
8491633 and its an endorsement i think of the value of retail grassroots face to face campaigning for which new hampshire is so well known
8491634 i support barack obama for president because america needs a president who has the strength wisdom and courage to talk to our enemies and consult with our allies a president who has the judgment to use war not as a last resort as a last resort not as a first resort you know there is an old saying of you do what you always did youll get what you always got america needs new leadership in the white house and that leader is barack obama
8491635 he took and pried the screen off and pried the window open to an empty bedroom and made his way through the house
8491636 i said i dont have any money and he said how come
8491637 he went in the bedroom and saw there was another phone and he pulled it off there
8491638 she hit the medical alert button which calls the alarm company
8491639 the caller stayed on the line with her and they actually talked to us while we were on the scene
8491640 i was so surprised she remembered to do it actually
8491641 she did great she knew what to do she called the alarm people and they were on the line immediately and the police were here almost instantaneously so it was great
8491642 one of the best traditional blues bands working in this part of the country plays here every sunday
8491643 help me out a little make some noise stomp your feet clap your hands for lee mcbee and the confessors
8491644 i thought about going out and getting a real job
8491645 the restaurant business is like the hotel business if you dont fill the rooms friday night you cant make up for it on saturday night its going to take a long time it may be next spring before we fully recover from this
8491646 they did it so we could raise money and help get us through
8491647 ive been talking negative for so long now im in a positive mood about whats going on
8491648 i understand these streets will eventually be widened due to ongoing development in the area but im sure it wont be anytime soon
8491649 as a short term solution can the city at least trim the trees and shrubs back to allow for better sight distance to the north

8491656 now theres some people who say george bush is doing a great job
8491657 no no wait hold up give me a chance let me explain i know i know what youre saying youre saying george bush is out of touch he doesnt understand me or my suffering and i hear ya but hear me out hey listen im doing pretty well myself cant complain but let me tell you about a friend of mine
8491658 do you think that john mccain at home in one of his many houses could ever relate to the pain of a single mom with cancer trying to raise kids and make ends meet when he cant even remember how many houses he owns
8491659 the president already has the mark of the american people hes the worst president we ever had
8491660 the miami herald and usa today reported george w bush would have widened his 537 vote victory to a 1 665 vote margin if the recount ordered by the florida supreme court would have been allowed to continue
8491661 clinton ordered the attack friday but the raid was delayed a day so it would not fall on the muslim sabbath the missiles struck late at night between 1 a m and 2 a m baghdad time because clinton wished to minimize possible deaths of innocent civilians
8491662 however tempting it might be to some when much trouble lies ahead to step aside adroitly and put someone else up to take the blows i do not intend to take that cowardly course but on the contrary to stand to my post and persevere in accordance with my duty as i see it
8491663 men of goodwill can disagree and still love their country and want the best for her
8491664 i consider president george w bush the greatest president this country has ever had
8491665 lets not judge them too harshly we have a hundred years of history to study since president bush they did not
8491666 what i havent heard about gas going to 4 a gallon
8491667 is the world a safer place upon his her departure fromt the world stage in all tests gwb is and will always be a great world leader
8491668 the repubs are trying to use hillary supporters as they do all the other factions of their party get them angry win their votes then abandon them amp their ideals when they are elected into office
8491669 the way i see it many conservatives are doing more to hurt america than any minority group has thus far all most minorities are trying to do is live the american dream
8491670 conservatives has been living the american dream so they are easily manipulated by stupid emotional issues packaged amp served to them by the fox news types
8491671 easily manipulated by stupid emotional issues packaged amp served to them by the
8491672 they live lavish with their large bank accounts amp ignore those of us who are struggling then when the bad news bite them in the butt they look to the federal government to bail them out just like the minorities
8491673 we should be holding the rush limbaugh amp sean hannity types accountable for their role in giving us the bu h crime family
8491674 for example detroit whose mayor has been indicted on felony charges hasnt elected a republican mayor since 1961 buffalo has been even more stubborn it started putting a democrat in office back in 1954 and it hasnt stopped since unfortunately those two cities may be alone at the top of the poverty rate list but theyre not alone in their love for democrats cincinnati ohio third on the poverty rate list hasnt had a republican mayor since 1984 cleveland ohio fourth on the list has been led by a democrat since 1989 st louis missouri sixth hasnt had a republican since 1949 milwaukee wisconsin eighth since 1908 philadelphia pennsylvania ninth since 1952 and newark new jersey 10th since 1907 the only two cities in the top 10 that i didnt mention miami florida and el paso texas havent had republicans in office either just democrats independents or nonpartisans over the past 50 years the eight cities listed above have had republican leadership for a combined 36 years the rest of the time a combined 364 years theyve been led by democrats five of the 10 cities with the highest poverty rates detroit buffalo st louis milwaukee philadelphia and newark have had a democratic stranglehold since at least 1961 more than 45 years two of the cities milwaukee and newark have been electing democrats since the first model t rolled off the assembly line in 1908
8491675 a lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is still putting on its shoes
8491676 its going to take a major hit on america with thousands of lives lost before anybody will do anything your son and his mates lives are not enough to get their presidents politicians attention
8491677 i will put my trust in the promises of god and since i am trusting him what can mere man do to me they are always twisting what i say all their thoughts are how to harm me
8491678 ill be long gone before some smart person ever figures out what happened inside this oval office
8491679 no my life is not better off in fact it is worse
8491680 i dont use liberal talking points i excrete liberal talking points
8491681 i dont use liberal talking points i create liberal talking points
8491682 he also says listing to his one sided rhetoric that comes to you via radio station filled with one sided propagandist looking to get rich by blindly riding off his coattail
8491683 that should not take away from their great qualities as pioneers and doers
8491684 then said jesus father forgive them for they know not what they do and they parted his raiment and cast lots
8491685 pickens is reaching that part of deep america thats usually not touched by the traditional environmental discourse
8491686 it was when hillary and bill came and it was like 90 to 100 degrees i just handed people water and stuff i was wearing a gore t shirt
8491687 is just helping people get set up in the morning
8491688 it was pretty cool seeing ted kennedy and michelle obama i just liked how many people had their signs up
8491689 he was put to work hed go to events and hand out literature bumper stickers a lot of publicity stuff
8491690 american people had their first date with michelle obama and it was matched in another way by another generation by ted kennedy
8491691 spanned the generations to the way people were inspired and motivated by john kennedy those of us who were their age at one time had a similar opportunity to be motivated by change
8491692 ted kennedy inspired us one more time and michelle obama is modeling that change it was an unusual historic event and ive never been prouder to be a democrat in my life
8491693 we were still working over the speech text in the car over to the fleet center in 2004
8491694 the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be
8491695 i am here first for barack obama and second im here to warm up the crowd for joe biden
8491696 like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8491697 barack obama is ready to honor the oath to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8491698 yes yes i accept your nomination to run and serve with barack obama the next president of the united states
8491699 john mccain is my friend weve traveled the world together its a friendship that goes beyond politics
8491700 but i profoundly disagree with the direction john wants to take this country
8491701 i think the conventions gone pretty well so far dont you think
8491702 i think michelle obama kicked it off pretty well dont you think if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night and just in case you were wondering i think president clinton reminded us of what its like when you put a president first
8491703 palliative chemotherapy which is what most oncologists do is meant to shrink cancer and improve the quality and quantity of life for as long as possible without making patients too sick in the bargain
8491704 there is a difference between palliative chemotherapy administered early in the trajectory of disease and near the end of life
8491705 the goal of end of life care should be to avoid interventions such as cytotoxic chemotherapy that are likely to decrease the quality of life while failing to increase survival
8491706 i have never let my schooling interfere with my education
8491707 the difference between writing a book and being on television is the difference between conceiving a child and having a baby made in a test tube

8491709 if the proposed project is what it is high end student housing it is going to have a lot of benefits
8491710 we would like to have something come in there to replace that property over there
8491711 a municipal building for our city hall a library maybe
8491712 in toronto for example one of the conference attendees cited the example of an orthodox jewish woman who could not patrol with a male police officer
8491713 what happened is that the police had a consultation with the woman and the rabbi and found some solutions that could work for everyone
8491714 in a lot of countries the police are perceived quite rightly not as an impartial servant of the public interest but the arm of an oppressive segment of society
8491715 they just dont realize that in canada they can and will become empowered to reach positions of authority and power that they too can abuse
8491716 its not the fault of the waitress that i dont speak chinese
8491717 why dont you learn to speak english if youre going to live here
8491718 give me life give me pain give me myself again
8491719 what you would like to do is have a chance to play a lot of young guys and let them play and put them in situations and let them fend for themselves
8491720 but obviously when the game is over you want them all standing tall and ready to go the next week too
8491721 it provides opportunities for guys to play themselves into expanded situations
8491722 that is what it does some of them are playing for a spot on the team some of them are playing to expand their roles
8491723 we dont need to be playing these games obviously you see in the league that guys are getting hurt you dont need to play obviously with us having a long season last year and going to the super bowl playing more games in the preseason and having a risk of injuries is not smart
8491724 its preseason and were going to go out there and the starting group will probably get one series well go out there try to play well put some points on the board and were just trying to fine tune for the opener
8491725 we have played the patriots in this particular position the fourth preseason game all of the time that i have been here and i think bill belichick will look at it just like we are looking at it
8491726 if you are running a race with a guy and he is a lap ahead of you and you have a strong finish you are still going to finish behind him
8491727 if you are neck and neck with the guy and you have a strong finish then you beat him and it makes a lot of difference
8491728 what you would like to do is have a chance to play a lot of young guys and let them play and put them in situations and let them fend for themselves
8491729 but obviously when the game is over you want them all standing tall and ready to go the next week too
8491730 it provides opportunities for guys to play themselves into expanded situations
8491731 that is what it does some of them are playing for a spot on the team some of them are playing to expand their roles
8491732 we dont need to be playing these games obviously you see in the league that guys are getting hurt you dont need to play obviously with us having a long season last year and going to the super bowl playing more games in the preseason and having a risk of injuries is not smart
8491733 its preseason and were going to go out there and the starting group will probably get one series well go out there try to play well put some points on the board and were just trying to fine tune for the opener
8491734 we have played the patriots in this particular position the fourth preseason game all of the time that i have been here and i think bill belichick will look at it just like we are looking at it
8491735 if you are running a race with a guy and he is a lap ahead of you and you have a strong finish you are still going to finish behind him
8491736 if you are neck and neck with the guy and you have a strong finish then you beat him and it makes a lot of difference

8491775 he was sad that he would not be at the same school as his friends but he told me that this year he was going to bring home the best grades i had ever seen
8491776 he was my best friend he knew me and i knew him inside and out i just keep waiting for him to walk through the front door
8491777 im a little blown away by this whole thing because it just started i think we ought to leave it the way it was constructed and see how well it performs
8491778 but once you start reducing and tearing the program apart theres nothing really left
8491779 lets give it a chance lets see how well or how poorly we do and go from there
8491780 you dont have to like the arts personally but you have to acknowledge the economic development power the arts can bring to the metropolitan area
8491781 but at the same time i think we have a responsibility to do more with the money
8491782 he was fine and alert earlier in the morning and at some point he went over and laid down and that was it
8491783 if they want to switch it needs to be done in the summer
8491784 i am defiant in my refusal to give up on our students
8491785 he is a danger he is evil and he needs to be locked up
8491786 it is simply impossible to convey the impact that this has had and continues to have on our lives
8491787 even though theres a war there im still glad i went i take a lot of things for granted like my education
8491788 now you know when we say about education and how learning can make you smarter and make your working better so you can be successful thats why we come here for the two of you to have big future
8491789 ashamed to be called their god for he has prepared a city for them
8491790 psalm 10 14a becoming man the character of god was not compromised or misrepresented
8491791 surely he took up our infirmities and carried our sorrows yet we considered him stricken by god smitten by him and afflicted
8491792 feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands
8491793 he is willing to abide by whatever conditions the court imposes
8491794 he does not want to live this lonely wretched life hes been living
8491795 first id like to apologize to the victim and to the general public i made the wrong choice im 100 percent ready to take full responsibility
8491796 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
8491797 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
8491798 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
8491799 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
8491800 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
8491801 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
8491802 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
8491803 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
8491804 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
8491805 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
8491806 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
8491807 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
8491808 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
8491809 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
8491810 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
8491811 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
8491812 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
8491813 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
8491814 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
8491815 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
8491816 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
8491817 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
8491818 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
8491819 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
8491820 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
8491821 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
8491822 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
8491823 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
8491824 we should be working with law enforcement right now to make sure that we protect people against people who are not capable of knowing what to do with a gun because theyre either mentally imbalanced and or because they have a criminal record
8491825 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
8491826 obama will communicate the urgency of the moment highlight the struggles americans are facing and call on americans to come together to change the course of our nation
8491827 a really important aspect of it is our ability to really be able to quantify what the benefit is
8491828 the green meter capability coupled with what we can already compute in terms of miles that would otherwise be traveled or gas expenditures that are associated with people going to these meetings as well as productivity loss with those travel hours is significant
8491829 green meter detects through the ip internet protocol locations of all those attendees who would travel to the host and through a series of complex algorithms is able to measure and provide metrics of what the carbon emission output would be from the trip as well as the fuel costs and fuel amounts associated with that trip
8491830 we first launched green meter a little over a year ago and since then across ilincs customers were going to save almost 2 billion pounds of carbon emissions this year
8491831 we err on the side of being extremely conservative because the numbers are so good
8491832 based on the distance of those flights it can determine the size of the jet that youd be taking
8491833 its very intuitive because of what our developers have built into it
8491834 the idea for this came from the governor janet napolitano herself who cast her efficiency review steering committee which is composed of senior staff in her office to basically go out and look for strategies that would help benefit the environment reduce travel and provide another basket of benefits that are associated with this kind of technology for web conferencing
8491835 we have end to end aes advanced encryption standard encryption that is the highest government level you can get
8491836 so that means everything that is leaving my computer right now gets encrypted and then it doesnt get unencrypted until it hits your computer
8491837 i think that in these times of tight budgets and increased sensitivity to the environment that web conferencing when done correctly can really provide a strong benefit for state and local governments
8491838 increased atmospheric carbon has a warming effect on the earth
8491839 while the scope and long term consequences of this warming effect are the subject of ongoing research we believe the united states should take measured and reasonable steps today
8491840 second as others have pointed out mccain is perilously close to turning his pow record into a punchline
8491841 like so many john mccain served our country bravely and suffered for years as a pow for that he deserves our thanks and respect and we have paid and continue to pay him that respect but having been a pow is not an excuse for a litany of bad votes in the senate and wrong positions as a candidate having been a pow is not an excuse for voting against veterans benefits or an excuse for supporting president bushs tax cuts for the wealthy or an excuse for supporting the use of torture john mccain was a brave soldier but he cannot hide behind that experience and use it as an excuse for every bad decision hes made since hes being anything but brave as a senator and as a candidate he should continue to use that bravery to try to defend those positions if he truly believes in them he should not hide behind his war experiences thats the opposite of bravery if they can figure out an artful term for it call him a damn wimp
8491842 we had to sit around in the dirt and eat if we were lucky
8491843 ibu lebih penyayang daripada bapa dan doa orang yang penyayang tidak akan sia sia
8491844 aku bertanya kepada rasulullah siapakah yang lebih besar haknya terhadap wanita
8491845 well i would have to say the biggest change is doing everything myself
8491846 id rather have people singing my songs than buying my cds
8491847 radio song that they cant write a song over 3 and a half minutes
8491848 okay guys you have to make sure every song has a chorus and its repeated at least 4 times oh and be sure to sing three harmony tracks over every chorus
8491849 trouble is only pulling in 30 50 people a night in the clubs they are playing i personally dont know how lucrative a pg tour would be sure i would be winning over a bigger fan base but as i said i am very happy with things as they are for now
8491850 that which is hateful to you do not do to another the rest of the torah is all commentary now go study
8491851 audio panton cogito singularis listen to everything think for yourself
8491852 del martin and phyllis lyon defined love devotion and constancy
8491853 michelle and i were deeply saddened to hear that del martin had passed del committed her life to fighting discrimination and promoting equality our thoughts and prayers go out to her spouse phyllis lyon and all those who were touched by her life
8491854 we are closely studying the board of marine inquiry report and we recommend the filing of criminal charges if the situation warrants
8491855 we feel responsible for the kids no matter where they are
8491856 but at the same time we still want to inform them
8491857 with the exception of the increased patrols it feels like any other day
8491858 reports like this are taken very seriously and ensuring student safety is a top priority of law enforcement
8491859 we are and will do everything we can to assure a safe environment for our children and to that end we are looking very seriously into this reported incident
8491860 the normal methods we would use to find someone who is a united states citizen dont work when someone is here and doesnt have the documentation of a u s citizen
8491861 sometimes i think weve been there so long people forget weve still got people over there
8491862 some days you dont hear about the war at all what happened
8491863 its simple things they crave like peanut butter or personal care products for ladies
8491864 hur m nga fasta f rh llanden har du haft hittills

8491866 when you represent your school youre held to a higher standard
8491867 our goal here is to treat water quality and water quantity
8491868 here they can see it physically they can touch it and that then makes it more meaningful than what they might just see in a text book or on the internet
8491869 i think it would end up with us making poor decisions generally
8491870 titan is an example of an industry that many in the community feel very strong that they dont want here and theres no local control
8491871 if you had to put a gun to my head id say its a bad idea i dont want to mess around with peoples property rights
8491872 if planning staff and the planning board through proper discussions feel like we need to do something then i would be glad to take a good hard look at it
8491873 we were holding back the river on one side and lake monroe on the other side
8491874 you can fight mother nature for so long she always wins
8491875 brought him photos of his family in early 2008 but that the prison guards searched his cell and took two of the photos away

8491888 if nine of us are arrested you must continue to rally here
8491889 its our victory that police did not storm and arrest us last night
8491890 at this moment there are more than 10 000 protesters inside
8491891 they will prepare documents and hopefully by early afternoon police will enter government house with a court injunction and

8491896 it is presumptuous in my view to suggest that we know where we need to be in 2050
8491897 this wont solve our energy problem by itself so there is no point in doing this
8491898 weve got plenty of oil to get us through the short term while we move to electricity
8491899 some chapters begin with a quotation please dont assume that my quoting someone means that i agree with them think of these quotes as provocations as hypotheses to be critically assessed
8491900 i have a major problem sending so much money overseas in order to purchase oil from folks who dont like us
8491901 rather than speeding up the use of our own oil why not put our emphasis on lowering our overall use
8491902 were going to have to get off petroleum sooner or later
8491903 just take an objective look at the continuous string of incidents at existing nuclear facilities and you will have to admit that what works great on paper falls a bit short in the real world leaks fires spills sleeping security squads
8491904 solar and wind along with possible tidal and geothermal will do the job
8491905 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
8491906 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
8491907 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
8491908 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
8491909 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
8491910 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth
8491911 the 17 point lead never existed everybody gets a bounce out of the convention
8491912 you know that youre going to be watched by more people than have seen you before that time
8491913 we tried to celebrate the notion that it would be a more open inclusive caring government
8491914 why does it always snow when im going to talk about global warming
8491915 sydneys largest dam warragamba has received 43mm of rain since thursday while the regions smaller dams got a better soaking including the upper nepean which got 108mm
8491916 the water problem is so severe for adelaide that it may run out of water by early 2009
8491917 mother nature in the form of planet earth is about 4 5 billion years old way older than even madonna
8491918 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
8491919 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
8491920 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
8491921 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
8491922 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
8491923 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
8491924 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
8491925 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was
8491926 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
8491927 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
8491928 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
8491929 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
8491930 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
8491931 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
8491932 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
8491933 whaddaya think yer doin takin that crap on looney toons

8491948 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8491949 president bill clinton reminded us of what its like when you have a president who actually puts people first
8491950 ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8491951 he will choose diplomacy first and military force as a last resort
8491952 the choice in this election is clear these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change
8491953 im pretty concerned about it spreading and hopefully it doesnt spread to my house are you concerned about your neighbors oh every one everyone involved were just lucky enough that no one was driving by and fell into it
8491954 were you trying to walk around with your eyes covered up no wonder you ran into something

8491959 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
8491960 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
8491961 a nashville based free market think tank and watchdog organization
8491962 its easy i think of a man and i take away reason and accountability
8491963 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
8491964 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
8491965 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
8491966 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
8491967 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
8491968 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
8491969 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
8491970 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
8491971 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
8491972 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
8491973 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
8491974 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
8491975 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
8491976 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
8491977 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
8491978 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
8491979 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
8491980 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
8491981 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
8491982 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
8491983 if were an arrogant nation theyll resent us if were a humble nation but strong theyll welcome us
8491984 stands alone right now in the world in terms of power
8491985 and in the race to stop global warming hes a friend of our planet too
8491986 john kerrys been fighting for thirty five years to protect our environment
8491987 really youre focused youre listening and getting a feel for the hall you havent been there you dont quite have that same feel as if youd been there for a few hours even
8491988 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
8491989 my maternal grandfather robert smith used to say this to me a lot as a kid
8491990 thoughts on revit architecture bim and how they change the process
8491991 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
8491992 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
8491993 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
8491994 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
8491995 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
8491996 it is hard to believe that the school system is operating without me kids got on the buses without me someone made coffee in the lounge without me
8491997 no not yet just go get a drink of water if you drink a lot of water that will help you to cool off
8491998 do not let your hearts be troubled trust in god trust also in me
8491999 put your finger here see my hands reach out your hand and put it into my side stop doubting and believe
8492000 why not update people on how things are going out here in good old california
8492001 we focused our work around three themes everyday browsing the things that real people do all the time safety the term most people use for what weve called trustworthy in previous posts and the platform the focus of beta 1 how developers around the world will build the next billion web pages and the next waves of great services
8492002 consistent with our efforts to promote further interoperability across the web microsoft will be releasing internet explorer 8 to render content in its most standards compliant way by default however browsing with the default setting may cause content written for previous versions of internet explorer to display differently than intended this creates a call to action for site owners to ensure their content will continue to display seamlessly in internet explorer 8 as such we have provided a meta tag usable on a per page or per site level to maintain backwards compatibility with internet explorer 7 adding this tag instructs internet explorer 8 to render content like it did in internet explorer 7 without requiring any additional changes
8492003 we are encouraging site administrators to get their sites ready now for broad adoption of internet explorer 8 as there will be a beta release in the third quarter of this year targeted for all consumers
8492004 we have been working on ie8 for more than a year and acid 2 has always been one of the milestones we set out to achieve we understand developers and designer want to know more about ie8 and we are talking about benefits and features relevant to them first
8492005 will never torture another prisoner or go to war against another country unless our own security is directly threatened
8492006 the difference between me and obama is that i didnt have any money

8492013 are we seeing a return to 1990 when the outgoing labour government made a whole lot of financial commitments without budgetary provision
8492014 no estamos en presencia de un episodio en donde un grupo de menores violentos eligen v ctima al azar y acaban con su vida sino leemos en la sentencia de un incidente m s bien que con un final muy diferente en la azarosa vida de eusebio ebulabate activo integrante de la banda denominada g a
8492015 se mov a en un contexto de violencia frecuente y no rehu a el enfrentamiento directo
8492016 desgraciadamente ten a que acabar as para que las autoridades finalmente tomen cartas en el asunto
8492017 i am here first to support barack obama and second im here to warm up the crowd for joe biden
8492018 i watched how barack touched people how he inspired them
8492019 and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8492020 john mccain is my friend its a friendship that goes beyond politics
8492021 but i profoundly disagree with the direction he wants to take this nation
8492022 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8492023 now its our responsibility to meet that challenge this is the time as americans together we get back up
8492024 around the beatles in full color paul mccartney to play tel aviv 43 years after israel banned the beatles
8492025 its like the way most experts missed predicting the fall of the soviet union
8492026 we have millions of race studies we were measuring some things but we werent measuring the right things
8492027 blacks should not push themselves where they are not wanted
8492028 to their loss of moral authority around race and poverty because of visionaries of the civil rights movement whites had to acknowledge that this was a racist society even to its founding
8492029 although my parents hid it pretty well you could tell the prejudices were there
8492030 he was a really nice person very open minded very even handed
8492031 there was never a question of someone being treated any differently it was a good example for me
8492032 we havent paid enough attention to the fact that there have been a heck of a lot of black people who have become midlevel white collar workers who seem to a lot of white people around them to be very ordinary
8492033 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
8492034 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
8492035 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
8492036 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
8492037 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
8492038 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
8492039 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
8492040 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
8492041 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
8492042 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
8492043 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
8492044 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
8492045 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
8492046 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
8492047 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
8492048 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
8492049 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
8492050 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
8492051 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
8492052 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
8492053 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
8492054 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
8492055 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
8492056 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
8492057 moreover since bill is not and has not been for years gainfully employed he will be scrounging around for cash everywhere but that wouldnt be exactly new would it
8492058 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
8492059 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
8492060 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
8492061 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
8492062 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
8492063 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
8492064 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
8492065 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
8492066 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
8492067 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
8492068 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
8492069 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
8492070 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
8492071 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
8492072 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
8492073 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
8492074 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
8492075 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
8492076 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
8492077 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
8492078 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
8492079 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
8492080 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
8492081 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
8492082 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
8492083 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
8492084 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
8492085 its same jennifer is on null inferior than a punish tour while in the past jennifer shunned message and shrank from photographers lenses today shes openly hortative the attention smiling display soured her body and creating picture ops
8492086 since evangelist said it was he who poor soured their four month romance jennifer has kept a formal bunk lip and permit her actions do the talking making trusty everyone sees her grinning and hunting sexy
8492087 jennifer was glowing grinning and existence rattling cordial as she ate eel tartare sway peewee and vegetable salad with a render of wine it was hornlike to conceive this was a blackamoor who meet poor up with her boyfriend
8492088 general secretary gorbachev if you seek peace if you seek prosperity for the soviet union and eastern europe if you seek liberalization come here to this gate mr gorbachev open this gate mr gorbachev tear down this wall
8492089 four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth upon this continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal
8492090 these republican leaders have not been content with attacks on me or my wife or on my sons no not content with that they now include my little dog fala well of course i dont resent attacks and my family doesnt resent attacks but fala does resent them you know fala is scotch and his scotch soul was furious he has not been the same dog since
8492091 why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university why is my wife glenys the first woman in her family in a thousand generations to be able to get to university was it because all our predecessors were thick
8492092 i started thinking as i was coming over here why is it that joe biden is the first in his family ever to go to a university why is it that my wife who is sitting out there in the audience is the first in her family to ever go to college is it because our fathers and mothers were not bright
8492093 those people who could sing and play and recite and write poetry those people who could make wonderful beautiful things with their hands those people who could dream dreams see visions why didnt they get it was it because they were weak those people who could work eight hours underground and then come up and play football weak
8492094 those same people who read poetry and wrote poetry and taught me how to sing verse is it because they didnt work hard my ancestors who worked in the coal mines of northeast pennsylvania and would come up after 12 hours and play football for four hours
8492095 so what if i didnt attribute it to kinnock i cant quite understand this if i was making up who i was then thats one thing
8492096 because there was no platform upon which they could stand
8492097 grew up well polished by gentlemanly pursuits he would ride to the hounds drive fast fly airplanes he knew good clothes fine horses the newest dance steps
8492098 he pissed away his fortune and joe and his siblings grew up in a decidedly and proudly working class catholic home
8492099 i guess by now many of you have seen the silly commercial
8492100 ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8492101 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8492102 i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8492103 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8492104 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8492105 my candidate didnt win but im proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children
8492106 hit a 500 foot home run he hit all the points
8492107 that was as clear a message as you could get as to why barack obama should be president
8492108 i mean when is the last time we elected a president based on one year of service in the senate before he started running
8492109 in theory we could find someone who is a gifted television commentator and let them run
8492110 i should be the last person to defend him but if he wins this nomination im going to do what i can to help him win
8492111 i had one on april fools about coach fitz pat fitzgerald
8492112 he can be a little nit picky so i wrote about how somebodys sock fell down and he wasnt too happy about it so he made us do up downs for 15 minutes i got good feedback on that one from fans they did get the joke and fitz loved it he said the best part was that it probably wasnt a joke
8492113 i want to express my deepest apologies to the families
8492114 will create more tempo for these fast break offenses and make it harder for the defense to catch up
8492115 im very leery of the rule because i think it will shorten the game and there will be a lot less plays maybe 10 15 per team
8492116 central michigan probably has an edge on most people in the west but when you look at the east side of this conference it has got to be parity
8492117 we were picked high last year so it doesnt mean a whole lot youve got to go out there and play
8492118 i honestly think it comes down to just being healthy and whoevers clicking toward the end of the season
8492119 each year were all in there trying to win the mac championship
8492120 theres not that much difference between most of our teams the most consistent teams are the ones that are going to win
8492121 we desperately needed the facility changes that we got this year
8492122 thats going to help us a lot in recruiting thats going to help us attract those types of nfl type recruits that we havent been able to get in to before
8492123 for your first game to be against boston college at cleveland browns stadium thats enough to ask for
8492124 for eons beer has inspired great literature its about time literature returned the favor
8492125 the motivation that is setting in my mind is totally new and exciting life is exciting and the promise of what i can achieve for myself is pushing me along like wind in a sail
8492126 you know they will probably get as in the class
8492127 we are both asian and for some crazy reason people tend to think all asians look alike and because of that we just have to be related
8492128 my name is alyssa conner yes i am asian no i do not get straight as and no this is not my sister sitting next to me
8492129 when i am with you please dont assume anything because it makes an ass of you and me
8492130 moving to the hanna has afforded us the opportunity to design a new home for our company that truly reflects our aesthetic right size our house for our audience and create a revolutionary theatrical experience that resonates more profoundly with 21st century patrons
8492131 i could go on about what i learned at great lakes for an hour and a half
8492132 additionally the hanna allows us to clearly brand the identity of our company inside the theater and on the exterior east 14th street marquee a luxury that we have never had in our 46 year history
8492133 we are grateful to him for his support as we approach the homestretch of our fundraising efforts
8492134 fortunately all the shows were good we were able to make money at the shows and sell a bunch of merch so we came back with more money than we left with
8492135 hes like hey you guys wanna be in a video game he didnt tell us what video game it was
8492136 i dont even play video games so i would never know
8492137 right now im not really making veal stock im barely using chicken stock so theres other things i dont need to do as much
8492138 right now were pretty much using as many tomatoes as we can
8492139 we take like three or four or five different types of heirloom tomatoes with some good olive oil balsamic fleur de sel toss it all together then we put a little spoonful of our homemade ricotta and a little bit of cooked farro on there and basil very traditional flavors but theyre just exciting because everythings at its peak
8492140 a mix of local heirlooms pickled watermelon rind watermelon habenero sorbet compressed rhubarb tomato water a small amount of pecorino and then a truffled compressed peach its summer tastic
8492141 its just blown up i think people are starting to appreciate the sweetness more i think theyre looking at tomatoes less as vegetables and more as fruit not all heirloom tomatoes are super acidic
8492142 the predictability of csa is probably an advantage you know ahead of time what your volume is going to be and farmers have the ability to plan but the diversity of products that the restaurants can use is much higher than with a csa list
8492143 i applied to design school not knowing what to expect
8492144 i ended up loving it i am a very creative person it was a great way to express myself
8492145 so all those people who think i just created it for the show are wrong
8492146 it was really great to work with him and the guest judges
8492147 you dont see the same madonna each time she comes out
8492148 stephen is one of those alumni who have kept up with the school
8492149 he has taken students as interns comes to the portfolio show and started a scholarship he has always been there when i needed him
8492150 we all want to win a championship and i watched teams like the patriots and the colts that were more family oriented teams and it helped them down the stretch
8492151 i believed in what coach martin said when he came to my house and talked to my mom
8492152 the trust issue was really a factor and he sold that when it all came down to it kent state was the right place for me
8492153 i think hed really like to see us as a team win the mac and go to a bowl game
8492154 i think thats the way he is hes a team oriented person and thats why hes such a pleasure to coach
8492155 that his unselfishness is why hes such a pleasure to coach
8492156 hes not a conceited guy worried about his stats i think hes more worried about us winning football games than how many yards he gets rushing
8492157 each game when i come in im going to play my best regardless and ive got different teammates around me that are going to take the pressure off me
8492158 last year eugene was all we had the last six games of the year
8492159 to his credit everybody knew that and he was still racking up big yards thats a testimony to what a great player he is
8492160 i dont want to play in the scrimmage and then have something happen to me and i get hurt and im not healthy going to play boston college thats the key going in healthy
8492161 i think gene really knows hes been in the battles so to speak
8492162 hes kind of taken those guys under his wing and really shown leadership with the running backs
8492163 hes probably a better person than he is a football player
8492164 he is really conscientious hes very professional he takes care of his business on the field and off the field and he is a real pleasure to coach
8492165 i think they did me wrong so im not going to purchase that game
8492166 someone from the kitchen staff just tried to sell me cocaine
8492167 lets order a slice of pecan pie and we can take it home with us

8492179 i enjoy getting the ball in my hands and helping the team win any way that i can

8492298 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8492299 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8492300 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way

8492313 should we trust john mccains judgment when he says there can be no timelines to draw down our troops from iraq that we must stay indefinitely
8492314 now after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home
8492315 canadian forces have done a remarkable job there they have been in the thick of the fight and they have suffered
8492316 that level of communication hasnt been forthcoming from president bush and the administration they have been preoccupied with iraq
8492317 the ability to reach out not just to government leaders but to the people of our allies

8492328 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8492329 we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8492330 sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8492331 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama

8492354 reds manager dusty baker always tries to run a bunch of lefties out when i pitch but theres always going to be a couple right handers that you can run the ball in on
8492355 with the lefties it opens up a few more pitches for me a lot of times with righties you only throw two or three different pitches but with lefties youve got five or six pitches to throw
8492356 i got the first guy out and kind of just lost command threw pitches over the middle of the plate
8492357 i got the pitch count up early i started worrying about that until about the third inning when they started really swinging on me early in the count and i was able to get some quick pitch outs
8492358 some big double plays turned for me helped the pitch count stay down and i was able to get deep in the ballgame
8492359 i was gassed a little bit toward the end i dont know if it was the first inning going a bunch of pitches right out of the shoot but i kind of ran down a little bit
8492360 he reached back he got some more he was consistently 94 95 mph and then reached back after votto fouled off a number of pitches and put 97 up in the zone
8492361 thats tough to catch up to if there was something wrong with him before theres certainly nothing wrong with him now
8492362 after he threw that last pitch he kind of gave me a little stare i got goose bumps it was a good thing i really liked the competition it was honestly a fun at bat but i lost in that situation
8492363 i played with fogg in pittsburgh and the guy knows how to somehow keep his team in ballgames
8492364 every pitch looks pretty much exactly the same one sinks one dives hes aggressive in the strike zone and then hes able to expand and thats when hes tough

8492378 be certain that under a democratic administration if that administration is showing aggressive tendencies or is putting us on the edge of a war again or not taking us into a direction of peace i am not going to be quiet i mean im going to continue to talk about the direction america should go in but we cant let those differences that we have right now cause us to fracture at a time that we really have to bring a change to the white house

8492383 i was basically on the internet for 14 hours a day looking for resources i wanted facts and i wanted reality i started looking and couldnt find anything and i realized that what i needed was another widow to come to my house
8492384 the first was a widow who was in my husbands unit
8492385 i was hoping i would learn a little about what my life would be like without michael i really just wanted to know that i wasnt alone
8492386 what was really cool was seeing all these women coming together to talk about their husbands
8492387 contrary to what most un widowed people think the second year can often be more difficult than the first
8492388 because i knew that there would be other women in my shoes who would want to hear it
8492389 were talking about getting an rv and driving across the country from base to base in small towns with a projector and a screen and showing it
8492390 the stories the mainstream media tells are the stories overseas
8492391 they dont handle that ripple effect of what happens after they hit the home shores
8492392 the military way underrates t b i and its symptoms
8492393 were at the tip of the iceberg of understanding it it is one of the most complicated injuries to one of the most complicated parts of the body
8492394 we were at the point of getting ready to lose the house and the cars then you start planning out things i was planning to do suicide and make it look like an accident so my family would get the insurance
8492395 she told me nothing was wrong with me but she gave me like 18 different medications for pain to go to sleep for lots of other things
8492396 they said it was because i didnt report it in the field and seek medical attention at the time and there was no proof
8492397 i had guys write statements for me to prove it had happened as a soldier with 23 years in the army them badges mean more than anything when you get injured you should be recognized even if you dont see it over there
8492398 i hear things but it doesnt throw it in the memory box
8492399 i was completely honest and said i dont think i have t b i
8492400 a lot of guys myself included fight the label of t b i no matter how mild in a way its like people are calling you stupid or retarded and i know thats not p c
8492401 since no one understands the relation they have to each other they said if you have one you have the other
8492402 they tried to say i had i needed a good nights sleep you name it
8492403 my t b i has impacted my ability to get a good job
8492404 find mommy some rocks to prop open these doors girls its driving me crazy
8492405 quick hes going to tell you how to make a paper boat
8492406 emma there is no way i can make this just by listening to this book
8492407 it was not obscene and it was never anything sexual or lewd it was about the excessive packaging issue
8492408 they were cautioned that dependant on the conduct during this event that should they violate the law they were subject to arrest
8492409 it didnt violate their lease and that certainly was what we were concerned with
8492410 our mall manager sat across from our shop to make sure that nobody was harassing us but we had no issues
8492411 we did have people come in and ask us why we were naked and they were intrigued by the idea of naked products but no one was offended
8492412 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
8492413 i didnt know what to do it was really scary
8492414 i just thought this is how she was going to die
8492415 it would be devastating to me to have something happen to her
8492416 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8492417 the current administrations foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8492418 its time to put force on the table and use it
8492419 the war in georgia is no longer about that country alone
8492420 it has become a question of whether and how the west will stand up for the rights of free people throughout the region
8492421 this is historic for me because as an old man i didnt think i would live to see this day come
8492422 this is a lifelong achievement for me i could not just watch it on tv i wanted to see it firsthand
8492423 let the present moment be the new beginning that it already is
8492424 my first formal and political visit to india would be a political one
8492425 we forged the 12 point agreement with other political parties to bring down king gyanendras regime in 2006 in india
8492426 because of that and other geographic and cultural relations my visit to india would have political connotation

8492436 i was offered playboy terminal assemblage and again a pair of months ago and i did invoke them down but thats not to feature i wouldnt study it in the future i hit no problems travel around the concern unclothed or anything

8492441 i dont want to see the building sold and then vaporized
8492442 for me this is not all about the money or just selling a property
8492443 we can make a selection based on use of the building as a consideration
8492444 thats where president johnson had many meetings with cabinet members generals heads of state and other officials
8492445 this is where lbj was energized with his can do spirit and whose legacy lives on in our world today through the many bills he signed for education conservation and space

8492450 we will get our economy going again and the best way to do that is through job creation
8492451 i think the worst thing you can do is raise taxes in a poor economy and sen obama wants to raise taxes i want to keep them low
8492452 sen mccain wants to give 4 billion in tax breaks to oil companies
8492453 sen obama wont raise taxes on americans making less than 250 000 a year
8492454 i want to cut business taxes so theyll stay in the united states and create additional jobs
8492455 if there is any good news about our economy it is our increase in exports i think its very important that we have open markets around the world
8492456 we have people who are sitting around the kitchen table figuring out how theyre going to afford their health care and educate their kids and many of whom have recently and suddenly lost a job
8492457 if we werent preparing them for jobs that are here right now we wouldnt have an enrollment of 24 000 students we wouldnt exist
8492458 the market demands that we prepare people for the jobs that exist and will exist
8492459 we really wish we had a version of photosynth that worked cross platform but for now it only runs on windows

8492538 lift down your buckets into the sea you are in the mouth of the amazon
8492539 like everything that the left does from entertainment to higher education the structure the format and the revealed results of information is conformed to present an image in which conservatives and their values are as invisible as blacks in the antebellum south
8492540 now that the republicans have nominated a center right mccain
8492541 if 60 of the people are conservative why is the gop getting its head handed to it again this election
8492542 be of good cheer for i have overcome the world
8492543 real change from the world that fails to the world that works
8492544 if republicans had any brains they wouldnt act like democrats
8492545 a conservative party would not support keeping troops in 700 bases in 120 foreign nations and a conservative party would never have become involved in the terri schiavo panderthon
8492546 if the most vunerable die libertarianism doesnt give a crap
8492547 if in fact both platforms are true then why was reagan the icon of the conservative movement
8492548 conscience of a conservative by barry goldwater than we can have a real discussion about what it means to be a conservative
8492549 not only is government not the solution but that its aid corrupts people
8492550 the bottom line on abortion is that america remains very divided and colllectively at least fairly ambivalent about abortion this has remained so for the last two generations since roe v wade
8492551 it only has remained for the last two generations whose mother was pro life
8492552 set a example to your child have a abortion that will realy showum what crazy thought

8492559 fishermen wont want to look up on the hill and see a house
8492560 clearly absent some other substantial evidence it is difficult to get in the mind of an individual officer
8492561 this is not to be interpreted as a finding that racial profiling discrimination or bias policing does not occur however it is difficult to sustain these complaints
8492562 we frankly have a continuing divide between where the department is and where members of the community are
8492563 i am not suggesting every single person who thinks they were stopped because they were black is accurate but it is a continuing perception in los angeles and this country and that perception is a reality in the minds of many people
8492564 whatever other departments do the fact remains there have been 1 100 complaints of racial profiling against the lapd and zero have been sustained over the last five years
8492565 its not realistic to believe that racial profiling never happens in the lapd
8492566 i dont think the members of minority communities for whom racial profiling is very real will feel at all comforted in the knowledge that other departments dont sustain complaints at high rates
8492567 proving a claim of racial profiling is very hard from a single complaint you cant say its racial profiling
8492568 profiling means that its an inherent pattern of an officer targeting someone of that race
8492569 all three projects are anchored in the nepali agenda peace needs development and development needs peace
8492570 as nepal continues to make progress on the crucial path of peace building and development nepal can be assured of continued world bank assistance
8492571 nepal has also hoped that china would extend more assistance to nepal in the coming days

8492577 she said obama was unprepared to lead unprepared to be the commander in chief that he was unprepared to handle the 3 a m call
8492578 obama has no record whatsoever doing that and john mccain has a long record of doing that so that should be at the core of the response

8492706 sick leave seems to be a way of life on average each employee is off sick for nearly three weeks each year the fact that the agency seems to function adequately despite this amazingly high rate of absence is a matter for surprise to say the least

8492711 theyre often our local offices round the country with a small number of staff and very close management
8492712 staff there are motivated not to throw casual sickies theyll let theirpals down because others will have to carry their workload

8492739 iran radical islamic government known sponsors of terrorism developing nuclear capabilities to generate power but threatening to eliminate israel
8492740 obama says iran is a tiny country doesnt pose a serious threat
8492741 terrorism destroying israel those arent serious threats obama dangerously unprepared to be president
8492742 and ultimately that direct engagement led to a series of measures that helped prevent nuclear war and over time allowed the kind of opening that brought down the berlin wall
8492743 now that has to be the kind of approach that we take you know iran they spend one one hundredth of what we spend on the military if iran ever tried to pose a serious threat to us they wouldnt stand a chance and we should use that position of strength that we have to be bold enough to go ahead and listen that doesnt mean we agree with them on everything we might not compromise on any issues but at least we should find out other areas of potential common interest and we can reduce some of the tensions that has caused us so many problems around the world

8492781 sitting here at the hollywood bowl makes me feel like were all part of this experiment that some ufos are about to do like they wanted to do tests on humans and they thought people who listen to radiohead were the perfect specimens
8492782 by developing a screen on our student systems we hope to make the process more top of mind and increase participation in the 3n system
8492783 while we hope to never have to use the 3n system to alert students to an emergency on one of our campuses having their contact information is essential to notifying them and increasing the opportunity to keep them safe
8492784 without change i dont know how long television can be sustainable for advertising
8492785 i want him to stop hurting and talking to the media about the people i love
8492786 kita sudah teruskan 18 laporan ke instansi yang berwenang termasuk kepolisian atau kejaksaan empat ditangani kpk dan 112 tidak ada indikasi dan 6 laporan disampaikan kembali ke pelapor jenisjenis laporan yang masuk diantaranya pns melakukan politik praktis seperti tpk di kabupaten belitung memori kasasi atas putusan banding tentang beli perkara di kajati babel penggalangan di bangka tengah penyimpangan pengadaan genset provinsi babel persoalan kerjasama pt timah dengan pt bidadari terkait penambangan timah dan ini sedang kita kirim ke bpkp
8492787 saya pikir selain faktorfaktor pemicu di atas kondisi ini diperparah lagi dengan kurangnya pengawasan dari pihakpihak terkait kebanyakan kasus yang terjadi dan masuk ke kpk kan tak hanya korupsi sendiri tetapi korupsi secara bersamasama makanya dalam pasalpasal tuntuta kpk ada pasal 55 yakni ikut melakukan secara bersama
8492788 masa di kejaksaan atau kepolisian tak ada pejabat yang bagus makanya kini kita sedang memunculkan sosoksosok yang punya kompetensi tinggi tidak hanya jaksa atau polisi tetapih masyarakat atau profesi apapun berhak memantau dan melaporkan dari laporanlaporan inilah kita bisa melakukan penyidikan di babel sendiri lumayan banyak laporan yang masuk ke kita
8492789 kami dari pemerintah provinsi menyambut baik datangnya kpk di babel ini kami sangat memberikan apresiasi bahwa kpk bersama polda babel bisa menyelenggarakan diklat anti korupsi sehingga kita termasuk pihak keamanan maupun masyarakat umum tidak hanya bisa memberantas tetapi mencegah menurut saya mencegah adalah hal yang terbaik
8492790 they always said we were going to throw the ball more each of the last couple of years
8492791 this year i think we really will oh yeah this will be a good year for him itll be a great test
8492792 i constantly fret and worry that were putting too much on white and the offensive players the hard part is the guys got to run a new system and it isnt their choice and it isnt my choice i came into the situation realizing not only pat but the entire group had been very successful and now they have to learn something new
8492793 i think his confidence level is very high especially throwing the football
8492794 to me pats the most versatile quarterback in the country were a top team without him were a top 5 team with him
8492795 ill be a lot less sore after games im sure my bodys happy
8492796 he likes it a lot gets to spread the ball around gives him a chance to throw not just running running
8492797 i think the world of him hes a great guy a great leader
8492798 a lot of people talk about patrick the player patrick the good kid i mean the guy is a very very intelligent player he picks up things so fast hes a very sharp kid a very sharp kid i dont think enough is said about that
8492799 ive always wanted to be a part of this series and have red sox across my jersey
8492800 its like a playoff game you get 11 runs behind you that made it nice too to win the game
8492801 it was awesome i didnt think i hit it out
8492802 i thought it was just going in the gap i hit it good its exciting its a huge win for us
8492803 we just need everybody to pitch in no ones over there boston trying to be the man
8492804 they know how important it is to get on base and extend the inning and when it counts theyve been getting the big hits its the whole team who came up short tonight
8492805 we took them from really being a specialty act into becoming headliners and worldwide entertainers
8492806 lets get real there is no wild the way it may have existed 100 years ago
8492807 okay well buy the business well keep you on because we need you you have the expertise
8492808 we believe that when we give the iam our final offer tomorrow our employees will see it as an outstanding offer the best in the industry and will vote to approve it
8492809 we believe that when we give the iam our final offer tomorrow our employees will see it as an outstanding offer the best in the industry and will vote to approve it
8492810 we have so much conversation topics to share it would really be a waste of our talents if we do not have our very own broadcast programme
8492811 i hope my good friends wont bar my calls on their mobiles and i will sure offer discounts to my good friends for buying advertisement airtime on our station
8492812 well at least it wasnt i bet you know what thats like
8492813 en raket i skallen r som en kula i huvudet
8492814 they spend a lot of time commuting or working and we would like to use that dead time to enable them to access services such as this one
8492815 last night hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything she can to elect barack obama
8492816 actually that makes 18 million of us because like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8492817 anybody who has any doubts about bill clinton supporting barack obama should rip them up and throw them away
8492818 i dont know if he outdid hillary but he came pretty damn close
8492819 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8492820 any time youre pitching from behind that means it takes any doubt out of a batters mind what youre going to throw next pitch if that happens major league hitters are going to hit you hard
8492821 he threw strikes thats why he had the results he had
8492822 its a shame we couldnt score a couple of runs for him
8492823 just strike one strike two dont get in hitters counts thats what theyve always told me and you can see it works
8492824 we just got my arm slot up just a little bit more
8492825 we kind of went back over some film and saw my arm slot was dropping down a little bit and i was slinging the ball
8492826 hopefully hes going to get better with his control because i think hes one of the parts thats missing in this team

8492828 all the parts of the internet are on the iphone
8492829 youll never know which part of the internet youll need
8492830 we considered that because the ad had not explained the limitations viewers were likely to expect to be able to see all the content on a website normally accessible through a pc rather than just having the ability to reach the website
8492831 we concluded that the ad gave a misleading impression of the internet capabilities of the iphone
8492832 renting out your vacation home allows you to have your cake and eat it too and the good news is its easy to do it yourself not to mention surprisingly lucrative
8492833 if you have a mortgage on your second home renting it out only 17 weeks will cover your mortgage payments for an entire year
8492834 if its paid for free and clear only five off week rentals will cover costs like bills for your phone power cable and association dues all the rest is profit when you consider that in some markets you can earn as much as 30 000 to 40 000 in rental revenue per year from your vacation home youre looking at a nice raise for yourself
8492835 life rarely turns out to look like we thought it was going to look
8492836 thats o k some of the happiest most successful people ive met during my years working in this field never dreamed they would rent out their vacation home and yet once they tried it they love doing it it pays to be flexible and keep your options open
8492837 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8492838 and just in case you were wondering i think president bill clinton reminded us of what its like when youve got a president who actually puts people first
8492839 at the start of this campaign we had a very simple idea which is change in america doesnt start from the top down it starts from the bottom up
8492840 that change is brought about because ordinary people do extraordinary things
8492841 this election is a chance for america to tell the merchants of fear and division you dont decide who loves this country
8492842 talking about being before it before you were against us before john mccain debates obama he should finish the debate with himself
8492843 now though weve just got so much more experience as a unit
8492844 weve played against mobile quarterbacks weve played passing quarterbacks for us it really doesnt matter
8492845 defensive football is a team thing everybodys got a job to do
8492846 if you do that and keep contain you might limit the damage
8492847 hes going to have plays regardless of how well you prepare for him
8492848 we just want to stop him from having too many big plays that can really hurt us specifically running past the line of scrimmage
8492849 its up to us as the linemen to get a nice push up the middle and really put the pressure on
8492850 once we do that as long as our ends can contain him on the outside he shouldnt be able to get out of the pocket where he can really hurt us

8492853 i am honored to be here tonight to support barack obama
8492854 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8492855 sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8492856 john thinks that during the bush years weve made economic progress i think its been abysmal
8492857 whose judgment should we trust should we trust john mccains judgment when he said only three years ago afghanistan we dont read about it anymore because its succeeded
8492858 or should we trust barack obama who more than a year ago called for sending two additional combat brigades to afghanistan
8492859 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama
8492860 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work i have done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8492861 just give me five minutes to take care of this guy
8492862 im not sure vladimir putin will be impressed by the power of our example or ahmadinejad but its a nice formulation
8492863 he also tried to make the democrats as strong as the republicans on military things
8492864 the continued existence of 12b 1 fees seems counterintuitive to investors
8492865 in the intervening period investors may be well served if closed funds particularly large funds that have efficiencies of scale voluntarily lower 12b 1 fees
8492866 the reduction in the underlying business performance of the gold coast parks can mostly be attributed to extended poor weather which covered all the major trading periods for the year including january school holidays
8492867 i dont run the company as a ceo if you have to get up every morning and tell them what to do then youve got the wrong people in the jobs
8492868 leaders have only an indirect influence on creating a more strategically effective culture

8492888 all truly wise thoughts have been thought already thousands of times but to make them truly ours we must think them over again honestly till they take root in our personal experience
8492889 it is appropriate given abramoffs extraordinary cooperation to date cooperation which can be wholly or partially credited for the convictions of a member of congress five high level legislative branch officials one high level executive branch official and two other mid to low level public officials
8492890 assisted with the governments investigation of scores of other persons who have not yet been charged
8492891 i think some people have the misconception that we changed our offense
8492892 if we had there would have been a lot of planning involved with it but were not changing our offense
8492893 its more just changing the tempo and doing what we want to do when we choose to do it
8492894 if you look at our scoring production it has been awfully good
8492895 i dont think it has anything to do at all with keeping up with anybody
8492896 obviously it does kind of increase the tempo and it gives us a chance to have more plays a game
8492897 it is still football you still have to take care of the football and you still have to put points on the board so you cant really lose sight of that and you have to play within yourself no matter how fast you are going
8492898 its my job to have him not press the issue
8492899 we want him to play similar to like he did last year and lead the nation in pass efficiency again statistically i dont think theres a lot of improvement to make but i think naturally hes stronger hes bigger and hes throwing the ball with more confidence and really throwing well
8492900 we have had a fair amount of success here doing what were doing
8492901 we dont intend to change that obviously there are different reasons for us to experiment with it and we will see how much more we will do of it but it has nothing to do with anybody else
8492902 everybody learned a lesson about staying so the highways will be twice as packed this time
8492903 we definitely dont want to wait until saturday or sunday to decide what to do
8492904 we dont need anything of this magnitude to come here
8492905 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario
8492906 when people come up to the window you can tell theyre excited about illinois
8492907 everybodys hoping that we do really well everybody that comes up to the window has been go tigers everybody is really excited about it
8492908 for the past four or five years ive seen the atmosphere continue to change
8492909 it just keeps getting better there was a time where there didnt seem to be anything distinguishing a football weekend from any other weekend
8492910 over the past few years the color and the excitement and the activity at the field around the field and everywhere in columbia has just been amazing this year wow it will probably be an absolute explosion because there is so much excitement around this program
8492911 it has brought the whole community to a new level
8492912 it brings in more people to the city during the entire fall season who need to stay the night and use our restaurants and buy retail its good for the overall business community for the team to do well
8492913 there is definitely a buzz going around people were excited for school to start back up for the first time in i dont know how long because that meant football games were starting
8492914 ive lived in this town for almost 10 years now and its fun being a fan of the tigers because of everything thats going on
8492915 working here i havent seen it like this thats for sure
8492916 it seems the football team has high expectations every year but now we have some substance behind that based on the breakthrough year we had last year
8492917 its just great to see people satisfied because for so many years we just couldnt get to where people thought we could
8492918 you take care of your business and these things will continue to happen for those people who cant those things can go away
8492919 its great for all missouri fans but theres a responsibility that goes with that and thats to play well
8492920 ive seen long periods of drought but ive seen some pretty great times too
8492921 but of course the scale this year is just larger
8492922 hi my name is d i am 32 years old i am 61
8492923 nice meeting you i like to meet you an talk to you beatiful lady like you am online you can talki to me on my hope to reed from as you see this mail thanks
8492924 i dont know i was reading a book and then it started raining and then i saw these figures standing out in the lawn
8492925 i am sorry cindy i am so sorry i am writing my third book and i just wanted to let you know that i truly do love you but i will have to go on as i have promised you to them i love you so much cindy but they have a better home for you i sort of sold you to them my first love was the condition i made the deal when i was sixteen and i was flunking i looked up black magic and devil worship and did every damn spell i could find until something came up and i asked to be able to write or do something with art and all it asked in return was my first love that is you honey i love you and well i have to go write i just made a deal for a movie and this very nice man would like to take you someplace and show you love that i never could

8492933 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8492934 the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8492935 sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8492936 she persuaded me to do it she showed me everything that made me choose her in the first place she threw everything behind barack obama in a way that made sense to me
8492937 the best decision the obama campaign ever made was to allow hillary to speak last night
8492938 i think the obama campaign will be nervous about it
8492939 if youre going to conduct an important race for the presidency of the united states you better use every weapon in your arsenal and let me tell you the clintons are a hell of a weapon

8492951 whether youre famous or not what it just means is that the rest of us will hear about it it doesnt mean that theyre the only people who will experience it theyre all equally tragic
8492952 but it can be harder for famous people to seek help because of their high profiles
8492953 my thoughts and prays are with marks family and friends he will be sorely missed my many

8492969 we would never claim that what we study in mice directly relates to how antidepressants work in humans but there are interesting features in parallel
8492970 the study unifies different observations that point to the brains dentate gyrus region and to creation of nerve cells as being important in depression
8492971 at least in mice this result directly links antidepressants and voluntary exercise with trkb mediated creation of nerve cells
8492972 we can get biochemical physiological behavioral and anatomical results in animal models
8492973 these all resonate with the human condition so perhaps you have a physiological relevancy
8492974 there could be a way to stimulate growth of nerve cells to fight depression for example

8492991 it must be clearly understood that any military cadres can be targeted
8492992 we have shown that the release of nanoparticles encapsulated in biofriendly starch by specific enzymes can serve as a prototype model for studying the digestion of biofunctionalized nanoparticles and may open newer research avenues where the stabilization and release of nanoparticles could be achieved using well known therapeutic biomolecules
8492993 probing au nanoparticle uptake by enzyme following the digestion of a starch au nanoparticle composite
8492994 in particular we observed that the digestion of a gold nanoparticles starch composite by amylase not only led to the degradation of starch into its lower analogues but also resulted in the release of encapsulated gold nanoparticles and their subsequent uptake by the enzyme
8492995 in addition to conventional biochemical and microscopy probes the surface plasmon resonance spr of gold nanoparticles provided a convenient way of following the reaction and establishing the mechanism our observations indicated that the rate of digestion of the starch gold nanoparticles composite by alpha amylase was similar to that of pure starch and the free thiol groups of the enzyme possibly facilitated the uptake of gold nanoparticles by the enzyme in comparison to other carbohydrate degrading enzymes such as amyloglucosidase
8492996 if one is interested in screening alpha amylase inhibitors then similar method could be used for that purpose alpha amylase inhibitors are known in plants to play important roles in rendering pest resistance attributes to the plants hence there is a tremendous interest in developing transgenic plants bearing such inhibitors the screening of the inhibitors produced by the plant or the functional assay of the inhibitors could be done based on the present method i e measuring the change in localized spr of gold nanoparticles
8492997 while conventional diagnostics take either a long time to complete may involve cumbersome steps are too expensive to be affordable for a large section of the population or exhibit low efficiency or sensitivity the use of nanomaterials could be of great help in overcoming those disadvantages
8492998 the question is can one address these downsides systematically with a reasonably good understanding of the science part of the process we would like to do that systematically at least in some of the cases
8492999 for example we have recently shown that use of silver nanoparticles in conjunction with gene therapy may be a better option for anti cancer therapy than the use of either of them

8493021 the rules seemed to change and they told me it had to be one word so i tried censorship but they didnt like that and then said it had to be no more than six letters long
8493022 i was looking for a project that would get my students interested in the history of the depression era in america
8493023 i was reading the newly released memoirs of blanche caldwell barrow my life with bonnie and clyde in my reading of that book i was surprised to see the okabena bank robbery linked to bonnie and clyde
8493024 at her sentencing hearing on sept 20 of 1933 mildred insisted she was innocent and suggested the authorities investigate bonnie and clyde whose exploits robbing banks was just beginning to make the headlines that summer
8493025 a recent development involving mildred one of the three convicted of the okabena robbery was revealed to me when i interviewed her surviving brother who told me about the day she brought home a boyfriend who was on the lam from the law for having robbed a bank he told me the boyfriend slept with a 45 revolver under his pillow his name was freddie dunn and it turns out that he and mildred were something of a bonnie and clyde like couple almost a full two years before bonnie went on the road with clyde
8493026 mr knight confirmed for me that she writes of how her son robbed the okabena bank
8493027 the question im trying to answer now is was it the high profile bonnie and clyde or the little known strain gang
8493028 that is the debate that i am attempting to definitively settle
8493029 unlike big city banks that were owned by large corporations small town banks like the one in okabena were owned by shareholders who lived in the community bank presidents were under tremendous pressure to keep their banks solvent and yet avoid foreclosing on people bank robbery was an enormous problem in the years from 1920 to 1935
8493030 today our tabloids obsess with the exploits of movie stars but for that brief period of time in the 1930s much coverage was devoted to the likes of john dillinger pretty boy floyd and bonnie and clyde bank robbers were admired but also reviled at that time
8493031 i have been reading court transcripts and legal documents from their various trials
8493032 all three of them seem to have been living the nightclubbing life during the last years of prohibition and were frequently dragged into police headquarters in sioux falls whenever a major crime occurred in that area they were linked to numerous bank robberies but so far my research calls into serious question whether they actually committed any however five witnesses to the okabena robbery were adamant that those three robbed the bank i am continuing to gather every scrap of information i can on the strains to see how this could be so
8493033 i want to thank wilburt soleta and his son for helping me locate just where the okabena train depot was
8493034 the depot agent was a key witness in the strains trial i wanted to be able to judge how far away he was standing from the rear of the bank when the robbers emerged
8493035 i am still in the process of interviewing the folks norman and marilyn told me about
8493036 normans cousin the late cleo atz kuhnau was walking past the bank when the alarm went off her dad august normans uncle is the guy who fired three shots at the robbers and was the one who ducked when they fired back missing him frankly i have barely begun interviewing the citizens of okabena i look forward to that portion of my research
8493037 i need to find answers to quite a few more questions before i will feel ready to tell the story well
8493038 i plan to visit okabena a few more times including next year during the july fourth reenactment of the robbery i do hope people will feel free to contact me with any anecdotes they may have about the robbery every detail no matter how small is another piece of the puzzle

8493044 when you get as old as me you should take a little time off
8493045 you either pay it or you dont you just cut out somewhere else
8493046 im not going to worry about it as long as my son in law has the money to take me along
8493047 i dont want to make excuses but weve had a lot of moves this year 100 and something we havent really swung the bats poorly but right now weve just got some kids that are trying to come into their own
8493048 its a long day you want to hear songs you know
8493049 thats the best advice we could give double wrap it and dont take polaroids

8493052 i might as well see if hell take the milk straight
8493053 what the hell did i put such huge photo for
8493054 wish you were here receiving your scroll too but why youre taking so long to finish your studies when youre supposed to have been 2 years earlier than me
8493055 whats a blackshirt mean if its just a symbol you havent earned
8493056 that black shirt represents dependability trust a sense that teammates can depend on me to do everything in my power to play the best defense known to mankind
8493057 me personally i think we need a game or two or three or four or five to prove not only to ourselves but to our coaches and fans that we deserve them
8493058 it was the same way when i was here the first time i dont see the point of it if you just hand them out to hand them out im looking for them to be earned
8493059 i dont know if you can compare it because we havent played any real games
8493060 i think the comparisons come when you play the regular season games its too hard to tell in preseason how to compare a team but i know this team is going to be a good team thats something i definitely know
8493061 having a lot of guys returning that played last year plus adding wide receiver bernard berrian as the deep threat weve got a lot of good guys that are going to definitely contribute to this being a good season
8493062 having that veteran experience is always a plus with madieu but tyrell has been playing like a veteran
8493063 hes getting out there and being in the starting lineup and we expect him to play as though he is a starter and when madieu comes back its going to be an extra plus to have another guy that can be a starter too
8493064 im like a fine wine a cabernet merlot shiraz blend
8493065 it can do a lot of things its gets better as you open it up and let it get out there and air out filtrate do all those things i dont even need a decanter just let me go out there and run pour me in your mouth suck it up and enjoy the run
8493066 be a big tv commentator or do what youre doing come on man and have to ask guys like myself questions like that im not ready for that yet
8493067 im the no 2 guy behind heath miller but still playing a lot yeah were doing two tight end formations every time im out there i just make the most of it and keep them wanting to use two tight ends whenever they can
8493068 its the last opportunity for a lot of men to make an impression we have some critical decisions to make as a football team
8493069 based on what leftwich has done to this point there is comfort
8493070 every day is so important for him because there have been very few days and opportunities so far he has taken advantage of those opportunities and gotten better he has to continue to do that tonight will be a part of that
8493071 i knew i could come in and learn it quick
8493072 ive learned as much as i could learn in a short period of time its still football im comfortable with it im just enjoying it and having fun
8493073 theyve had good moments and theyve had moments that havent been so good
8493074 theyre fighting theyre young guys they make mistakes hopefully they dont make too many thats a hotly contested battle one that may be waged on tonight and ultimately decide how those spots unfold
8493075 its one of those things where its a day to day battle
8493076 im not getting caught up in numbers and whos doing what i just go out and play my best and play my game
8493077 i talked to them and let them know i want my shot to do some punt and kick return stuff because thats what i do and i feel im real capable of doing it
8493078 i think of myself as being able to do the whole nine yards being able to do whatever they want me to do return kicks cover kicks catches passes block whatever
8493079 about 50 per cent of an inspectors time is spent on the floor of the plant the other 50 per cent is overseeing paperwork most of it scientific in nature test results and the like
8493080 were concerned with the safety of the food supply and canadian consumers
8493081 there is no valid argument whatsoever that theres been cuts to the canadian food inspection agency
8493082 one of the most stringent food safety systems in the world but we can always make it better
8493083 thats why were investing 113 million in canadas food and consumer action plan and have already hired 200 more inspectors with more to come
8493084 there has to be a shared responsibility there is no system in the world where every product is inspected all the time thats just not feasible
8493085 through this particular crisis we will evaluate everything we learned from it and make sure the changes we are making will prevent this kind of thing from ever happening again
8493086 this week its our best efforts that failed not the regulators or the canadian food safety system
8493087 i emphasize this is our accountability and its ours to fix which we are taking on fully we have and we continue to improve on our action plans
8493088 youre racing from place to place doing the paperwork and how much time does that realistically leave you to do inspection activities
8493089 even if your manager has the sense to tell you to use your discretion and judgment if you think you want to take a quick stroll through the plant youre often not going to have the time to do it anyway
8493090 theyve moved to a paper system whereby industry basically regulates itself so the big loss in terms of front line inspection happened long before the conservatives came onboard
8493091 the conservatives are simply doing another round in the same direction
8493092 we will not restart the plant until this investigation is complete and ive signed off on it personally
8493093 the toughest situation weve faced in the 100 years of this companys history
8493094 go die in a whole i mean really it doesnt get better than that
8493095 we were all laughing so hard in the office its a lesson on why we have this show in the first place
8493096 i certainly hope this is not the pinnacle but things are certainly the best theyve ever been for me
8493097 it seems like all my ducks are going in the right direction i just hope they dont drink too much grey goose on the way like their owner
8493098 for other people it may be awkward but its certainly not for us
8493099 the minute you see us its clear what were about its a very playful relationship
8493100 i recuse myself from dealing with chelseas salary the business dealings
8493101 i know exactly what e is you have to get some fun out of it
8493102 i am so surprised to hear that question that is honestly the first time i have been asked that
8493103 like the original this trial is ultimately unsuccessful thus creating an articulated and critical commentary about the current war strategy
8493104 the american response to this work has been frankly immature and lacking the sophistication and consideration that other parts of the world have so far shown the work
8493105 the only reason i made it was i had nothing else to fall back on
8493106 there are people that love cheech and chong that have never smoked a joint in their life its not about pot itself its about the freedom to pursue happiness in whatever way you desire that doesnt hurt anybody
8493107 we both looked at our bank accounts and decided they needed filling
8493108 after the last fight we had together i got tired of fighting
8493109 my egos too big and cheechs is too big so all our kids had been trying to get us back together for years they want to have an inheritance when we die
8493110 both us we realized we dont want to be like the beatles where its too late to go back
8493111 cheech came in did the whole show and then we did six shows
8493112 wed get halfway through a bit and then one of us would remember the next line and whisper it to the other guy a lot of it was improv anyway
8493113 the great thing was cheech hadnt done comedy in 30 years almost and next think you know he was right back
8493114 my time in jail has been very precious to me
8493115 it came at the right time in my life and my familys too it drew everybody together and it eliminated a lot of people who werent really my friends anyway
8493116 im a guy that does poop jokes for a living
8493117 looking at the parts we are playing im very concerned about what you think of us
8493118 like george im not sure if i should be flattered or insulted
8493119 have you seen the film and you call that a love letter
8493120 we started writing the movie as kind of an exercise thinking of what kind of parts these actors might play what kind of story they might inhabit
8493121 its really a funny script i didnt feel any need to wander off the script
8493122 he doesnt consider any other possibility other than what he thinks will happen i pretty much ran with that
8493123 theres something really really funny in terms of my character being so angry all the time

8493131 you wouldnt be transplanting cells so you wouldnt be dealing with immune issues
8493132 we just asked sort of like an undergraduate the simple question why should you have to go all the way back to the beginning

8493134 barack obama is ready to be the president of the united states
8493135 i didnt play quite as well as i did the other day in the first round didnt find my rhythm but sometimes you just have to get through these matches
8493136 i still look at it as this is where i should be if im healthy and can play halfway decent
8493137 im obviously probably more excited than maybe i used to be by getting to the third round but i feel when im in a tournament and im competing and im healthy that i should be winning some of these matches
8493138 it was only when i got back from china maybe last saturday that i was able to start practicing for singles
8493139 so to expect i would be out here and be perfect is probably shooting for the stars a little bit too much
8493140 i dont feel like im that far off i just feel im timing the ball just a little bit late not as perfect as id like it to be if i can get that going hit more penetrating shots i feel i can turn my game around
8493141 most problems cannot be solved and most problems are made irrelevant by success
8493142 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8493143 critically but also very very sadly russia has not reconciled itself to the new map of this new region
8493144 the president of russia has said he was not afraid of a new cold war we do not want a new cold war and he has a big responsibility not to start one we need to raise the costs to russia for disregarding its responsibility
8493145 shes a mana junkie just think how bad she will be as fire
8493146 she does enough as it is why would i want to die more
8493147 entscheidend ist dass die eu russland geschlossen und mit klarheit und festigkeit gegen bertritt
8493148 wir sind teil der eu und nicht vermittler zwischen der eu und russland eine solche vermittlerrolle w re weder sinnvoll noch richtig
8493149 da sollten wir schon auch auf die h ren die unter nazi deutschland ebenfalls oder wie polen noch mehr gelitten haben als russland
8493150 russland hat vor allem auch nach beendigung der k mpfe in georgien deutlich gemacht dass es sich an vereinbarungen nicht halten will
8493151 russland ist dabei georgien weiter zu destabilisieren mit dem ziel dort eine russlandfreundliche regierung zu etablieren das hat neben der v lkerrechtswidrigen anerkennung von abchasien und s dossetien den konflikt versch rft und eine l sung weiter erschwert
8493152 i dont want to pick on any particular department because i think were all in the same bag
8493153 were in serious trouble in this county and we have to face it
8493154 since the mall came in the late 70s weve lived and breathed on sales tax
8493155 j c penneys moving to the highlands in ohio county didnt help but it didnt really have that much of an impact on us hopefully next year well have something else there
8493156 we must take hold of our departments or we will be laying off people
8493157 thats a blunt as i can put it ive not said that in 32 years but at least 70 other auditors in the state have made that statement it looks like its going to get really bad
8493158 we have worked closely with the auditors office on this project weve met with deputy auditor andy sutak dozens of times but this is the first time weve ever heard of that
8493159 we never once mentioned a jail operating levy i would be vehemently opposed to it thats my position in difficult economic times you dont go ask the taxpayers to spend more money

8493176 tell wgn that by providing kurtz with airtime they are legitimizing baseless attacks from a smear merchant and lowering the standards of political discourse
8493177 it is absolutely unacceptable that wgn would give a slimy character assassin like kurtz time for his divisive destructive ranting on our public airwaves at the very least they should offer sane honest rebuttal to every one of kurtzs lies

8493198 these poll findings show just how many people are getting worried about losing their job in the current economic slowdown
8493199 the economy will inevitably slow this year and next given the credit crunch and the impact of higher oil food and commodity prices but there is a real danger that if everyone thinks that the downturn will be deeper than it needs to be it will become a self fulfilling prophecy

8493221 hotel stays will probably increase because of the late time of the game ive been suggesting to anyone and everyone that it would be a great idea to get downtown on saturday afternoon and enjoy the game and plan to stay in a hotel make a weekend of it people will be partying all day so its a responsible and enjoyable thing to do
8493222 the cardinals are out of town this year on game day
8493223 but the game is in the evening so i expect that all our fans will come downtown earlier in the day and they will take advantage of downtown st louis and the way that its grown and changed i think the event works well for both the fans and the downtown businesses
8493224 the benefit to the schools is that this is a financial opportunity to them every year
8493225 as opposed to playing one game at home where they realize the financial benefits and one game on the road where they dont
8493226 we have developed an extremely simple iphone application that allows us to display comics that have been specifically formatted for the iphone ipod touch
8493227 what were doing is creating new comics and adapting existing comics into a format that makes reading comic books an enjoyable and easy experience on these devices
8493228 met de blik stevig op de toekomst gericht in de geest van de eenheid met het doel om te winnen met vertrouwen in de partij en in het land laten we met n stem hier en nu verklaren dat barack obama onze kandidaat is en onze president
8493229 i definitely felt like id lost something it felt kind of personal
8493230 at the end of the day we have a house full of democrats and we need to go out and elect a democrat
8493231 they asked me about whether the party would unite or still be split because of the long hard fought primary campaign between clinton and eventual winner u
8493232 i was dressed pretty elaborately so i was interviewed a lot
8493233 we have two opportunities to vote in the first one youre obligated to vote for your committed candidate then you go through a process that you can change and i will vote for obama then most everyone will i think the key is that we have to wait for her clinton to release her delegates to do that and she did that this afternoon wednesday
8493234 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8493235 he sure rocked the crowd he had this whole crowd standing up
8493236 he talked about the things that divide us instead of unite us under the theme of wake up america he said not to let any of this divide us when dennis gets rolling he can get a crowd going
8493237 i do the morning caucus with the ohio democrats then go to another hotel for afscme and then go back and get ready and come back here
8493238 i was to california for al gore and to boston for john kerry
8493239 it didnt happen we got into an argument i think he was thinking i was with my ex he gets jealous like i do i drank that day i take medications i took extra pain pills i was pretty inebriated we both had words we both have tempers he never took a machete to me
8493240 my goal this year is to try to reduce those 19 crashes by 50 percent
8493241 even 19 wasnt so bad over four days and none of them were fatal or caused serious injury so in that regard it was a very successful holiday period this year were striving for no fatalities no serious injuries and trying to keep the crashes to no more than 10
8493242 thats really keeping the numbers as low as you can get them realistically
8493243 there are some we cant do anything about if they strike a deer or something like that
8493244 because last labor day weekend was so grim our goal this year is to do everything we can to keep the number of fatalities as low as we can 24 is an unacceptable number
8493245 our goal is to be as aggressive as weve always been taking a zero tolerance approach toward drinking and driving impaired or for failure to wear seat belts
8493246 by attacking those violations and impaired drivers and enforcing seat belt laws we should experience a safe holiday weekend
8493247 were going to have a lot of officers out and when motorists report unsafe behavior theres more likelihood that well have a cruiser in the area and can catch them
8493248 put the signs down for now well tell you when to put them up
8493249 i believe from the bottom of my heart with the right vision the right leadership and the energy and creativity of the american people there is no nation that we cant out hustle or out compete and no american need be left out or left behind
8493250 we have a press bottleneck between alaska and new york they wont move

8493253 barack obama has a different vision and a different plan the status quo just wont cut it
8493254 guys you cant stand there youve got to keep moving move move move
8493255 dapat ninyong malaman na walang ginagawa ang anak sa kanyang sarili lamang ang ginagawa lamang niyay ang nakikita niyang ginagawa ng ama

8493259 the proposals laid out in the consultation paper on the future of tobacco control are the enemies of choice they are simply another stage in the governments rolling programme of interference and intrusion into the lives of free individuals
8493260 this is the equivalent of going to another teams locker room and stealing the playbook
8493261 when youre talking about trying to stick a needle in their arm and kill a person you better play by the rules
8493262 i can see why so many third base coaches send runners
8493263 i dont like this place i dont know what it is about this place but they play us tough
8493264 in my mind he was going to have to come over me to score that run
8493265 that was obviously a big play just to hold them off
8493266 that was huge im sure he feels wonderful i feel good for him
8493267 usually i pride myself that if we score some runs i dont give up the lead that wasnt the case today
8493268 im thankful the guys picked me up and picked the team up
8493269 we will not wait for the courts to act for we have been waiting hundreds of years we will not wait for the president nor the justice department nor congress but we will take matters into our own hands and create a great source of power outside of any national structure that could and would assure us victory
8493270 allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force
8493271 will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
8493272 free at last free at last thank god almighty we are free at last
8493273 the interests of both the public and the opposing party should be considered when determining whether to grant an application to proceed under a pseudonym
8493274 in light of the serious nature of the claims pressed in this action we encourage the district court to consider whether it should appoint a pro bono counsel to represent the sealed plaintiff in this action
8493275 making errors with respect to a patients medical records while a younger white employee was not disciplined for making the same errors
8493276 obligation to resort only to honest and loyal conduct in advancing a claim unless the employee proves that it is necessary to resort to other means

8493282 there wont be any riots in miami because the people who rioted in chicago are on the platform committee
8493283 i thought hillarys speech was great bills too but in its own way i think
8493284 was i hallucinating or was that not a stirring passionate acerbic and moving speech kerry expressed the rage so many of us feel when contemplating not just the failures of the last eight years but the chutzpah contempt and arrogance that have accompanied them and he went after mccains betrayal of the very virtues he still lays claim to
8493285 i wish biden had taken a page from john kerry and expressed more personal disappointment in his friend i have known and been friends with john mccain for almost 22 years but every day i learn something new about candidate mccain as kerry put it biden just mentioned his friendship with mccain and then went on to critique his policies as though they were two unrelated things kerry was sharper
8493286 i thought john kerry came closest to what democrats needed to achieve which was to define john mccain only kerry highlighted the miles wide gulf between the 2002 era mccain and the mccain whos running for president better yet kerry framed the idea in remarkably pithy and memorable terms
8493287 bill clintons speech rightfully grabbed attention but john kerrys appearance interrupted by a commercial break on cnn was the best stab the democrats have taken towards establishing something theyve desperately needed a master narrative for understanding john mccain

8493314 i profoundly disagree with the direction that john wants to take the country
8493315 ive been on the ground in georgia iraq pakistan and afghanistan and i can tell you in no uncertain terms this administrations policy has been an abject failure
8493316 again and again on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8493317 and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8493318 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8493319 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8493320 after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home
8493321 be there because barack obama and joe biden will deliver america the change we so desperately need
8493322 joe biden is right we need more than a good soldier we need a leader with the experience and judgment to serve as commander in chief from day one that leader is john mccain

8493335 they were incredibly close their two characters just got married
8493336 like other members of the cast and crew jolene is struggling to come to terms with the death of her dear friend overnight
8493337 no one loved her doing it more than mark he was thrilled
8493338 they were devastated so we closed the set immediately as people were trying to come to terms with the tragedy
8493339 his work on stage and screen was admired by everybody who knew him
8493340 his death is such a sad loss we at channel seven will miss his energy and smile
8493341 our thoughts and prayers are with marks family and friends
8493342 that thing you just tripped on is where the generals barracks once stood and right there where you twisted your the trail of tears
8493343 academics arent the focus john mccain graduated 894 out of 898 at the naval academy in 1958 and frankly after decades in the senate is still pretty clueless about governing and public policy we arent interested in training more policy wonks legislators or thought leaders we want to create leaders in john mccains mold by stressing people beyond the breaking point people who battle post traumatic stress syndrome develop instant reactions and have the right stuff to make the difficult decisions about our countrys future
8493344 theres miss gultrots vegetable and broth shop shell warm you up with one of her famous hot frog luncheon meat soups

8493347 the hamster heath winter farting contest of course its due in three days time and the field is covered with frost and the farting post is buried under five measures of snow
8493348 im done for at the moment youll have to organize it for me
8493349 but i dont approve of breaking wind how can i be responsible for organising the annual competition
8493350 you cant go placing something so important as the annual winter farting contest in the paws of a child
8493351 this will take serious organising brew concoctions special safety procedures lower lumber supports printing of banners and of course a website
8493352 put the future of hamster heaths annual winter farting contest in the paws of a non believer never
8493353 your tackle is shrivelled like a week old lettuce you need a jolly good warming up how about having another bowl of my fabulous broth leave that foul contest to me
8493354 and miss gultrot has made you her second in command what an honour

8493365 considering the squad that weve had for both of our opening games with a wee bit of luck we could have won both games and could be sitting top of the hyundai a league
8493366 there have been a lot of positives to come out of both games pedj bojic has been outstanding boogaard is back now matt simon is back and doing well petrovski is doing well and caceres and elrich are getting better with every game
8493367 it looks like jedinak and macallister will be up for selection on sunday as we said in the first week of the season itll take us about two or three weeks for our squad to get bigger which puts more pressure on players to perform which is what its all about
8493368 you cant leave your run in the hyundai a league for too long weve got a full year to plan for with the afc champions league to come and its very important that we start getting results
8493369 going to queensland this weekend will be very hard we saw at the weekend that they totally dominated adelaide and theyre very hard to play against at suncorp stadium
8493370 these changes are different and separate from the changes in thinking skills that occur as people get older
8493371 we found accelerated changes in peoples mental skills that indicated a terminal decline phase years before death
8493372 cardiovascular conditions such as heart disease or dementia that is too early to be detected could be factors
8493373 increased health problems and frailty in old age often lead to inactivity and this lack of exercise and mental stimulation could accelerate mental decline
8493374 this indicates that people remain stable in their verbal abilities unless they are experiencing disease processes that also increase their mortality risk
8493375 since i came to australia ive been coming and watching and supporting glory
8493376 theyve been one of the best teams in the league back in the day so i want to see that happen again
8493377 it would mean a lot for the club and for perth its been such a great club and its still a great club and hopefully it will be one of the best in australia again
8493378 ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8493379 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8493380 i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8493381 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8493382 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8493383 my candidate didnt win but im proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children
8493384 he loves our country every bit as much as we all do
8493385 and as a senator he has shown his independence of right wing orthodoxy on several issues
8493386 still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years
8493387 it is indicative of the concern among democratic voters about barack obamas inexperience that after three full days of the democratic national convention president clinton was finally forced to testify that senator obama is ready to be president despite his previous arguments to the contrary
8493388 hit a 500 foot home run he hit all the points
8493389 i mean when is the last time we elected a president based on one year of service in the senate before he started running
8493390 in theory we could find someone who is a gifted television commentator and let them run
8493391 i should be the last person to defend him but if he wins this nomination im going to do what i can to help him win
8493392 not ready 08 presser in denver colorado counterprogramming the democrats
8493393 not ready 08 presser in denver colorado counterprogramming the democrats
8493394 we would never claim that what we study in mice directly relates to how antidepressants work in humans but there are interesting features in parallel
8493395 the study unifies different observations that point to the brains dentate gyrus region and to creation of nerve cells as being important in depression
8493396 at least in mice this result directly links antidepressants and voluntary exercise with trkb mediated creation of nerve cells
8493397 we can get biochemical physiological behavioral and anatomical results in animal models
8493398 these all resonate with the human condition so perhaps you have a physiological relevancy
8493399 there could be a way to stimulate growth of nerve cells to fight depression for example

8493425 barack obama en ik legden een heel verschillend parcours af naar deze bestemming maar we delen een gemeenschappelijk verhaal
8493426 herinnert u zich nog de tijd dat de wereld ons vertrouwde toen men naar ons keek voor leiderschap met barack obama als president zal men ons opnieuw vertrouwen en zullen we weer in staat zijn om te leiden
8493427 in 1992 zeiden de republikeinen dat ik te jong en onervaren was om opperbevelhebber te zijn dat werkte niet in 1992 omdat wij aan de juiste kant van de geschiedenis stonden en het zal niet werken in 2008 omdat barack obama aan de juiste kant van de geschiedenis staat

8493435 we want our mustang pony badge to be as good as the rest of the car
8493436 making mental ill health in prisons an even bigger problem
8493437 it is inevitable that prisoners in huge jails far from home will lose touch with their families and friends and end up leaving prison rootless and unskilled
8493438 the more prisoners there are the more ex convicts you will end up managing this countrys very high reconviction rate shows that prisons are currently failing to rehabilitate convicts while often destroying families and jobs
8493439 titan jails are a bad idea but it would be equally wrong to ignore the state of prison overcrowding we must address this problem and we cannot simply empty our jails of serious or repeat offenders
8493440 the right way forward is to build smaller local prisons with a new focus on reducing re offending and in this way arrest the growth in prisoner numbers
8493441 titan prisons will be a titan nightmare for those communities unfortunate enough to have these massive complexes built on their doorstep
8493442 over the course of the year the communities near titan jails will see thousands of prisoners spat out of the gate with no prospect of sensible and safe resettlement
8493443 quite frankly these are perfect market conditions for the drug trade and will inevitably result in local crime and disorder
8493444 the government is on the verge of making a massive costly and hugely damaging mistake that will destabilise the criminal justice system for years to come said juliet lyon the trusts director
8493445 giant us style prisons may be easier to build but all the evidence here and abroad says the price we would pay in running them and in higher re offending rates is far too high
8493446 we believe that investment in community sentences and in smaller units for those who need to be in custody especially for women and children are better ways of solving the prison crowding problem than building titan prisons

8493450 my heart goes out to families coming face to face with this difficult issue
8493451 i feel that no physical barrier can prevent suicide on or off the bridge from happening
8493452 the 50 million would be better spent to educate teens and adults about stress depression how to recognize it in themselves as well as for suicide prevention
8493453 we also got many written responses and those will be looked at along with responses we got from agencies
8493454 the board will be presented with the information in october
8493455 to awaken a generation out of spiritual death and religious complacency calling them into their individual purpose and corporate responsibility as an offensive army imposing the kingdom of god
8493456 people have to be shown their condition before they can truly be saved

8493460 the temperature of the women evidence of field painting and wild haste and confusion as to be no popular literature the aeronauts of 1783 are roziers the comte de dampierre and the trains which will be understood by the current may now seem dwarfed by comparison with the highway a car was 84 feet long and the other

8493469 neh im not hitting the pool today i just dont feel like it
8493470 in no direction that we turn do we find ease or comfort if we are honest and if we have the will to win we find only danger hard work and iron resolution
8493471 it is from weakness that people reach for dictators and concentrated government power only the strong can be free and only the productive can be strong
8493472 have we truly tried self determination or just our version of it
8493473 um maam you might want to get up before you get sucked into the luggage area
8493474 canon is now at risk of losing half of its copier sales in north america
8493475 we think this move by ricoh to make the largest ever acquisition during a period of global economic stagnation represents a positive surprise from the standpoint of aggressive management
8493476 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8493477 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8493478 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
8493479 tony rezkos family helped the obamas on the house deal
8493480 but if youre like me and you got one house you might have a different perspective
8493481 household income jumped from 991 296 in 2006 to 4 2 million in 2007
8493482 americas greatest moral failure in my lifetime has been that we still dont abide by that basic precept in matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me and that notion of that basic principle applies to poverty
8493483 he was homeless for 10 years including when sen obama visited nairobi two years ago
8493484 obama campaign workers have fanned out in various battleground states to ask voters if they remember how many homes they own among the states are pennsylvania and florida
8493485 you have to admire wayne for picking a left field choice
8493486 it will be fascinating to hear from the chairman as to why he roberts is the right guy
8493487 it will be a privilege to contribute to the companys governance
8493488 it is appropriate given abramoffs extraordinary cooperation to date cooperation which can be wholly or partially credited for the convictions of a member of congress five high level legislative branch officials one high level executive branch official and two other mid to low level public officials
8493489 assisted with the governments investigation of scores of other persons who have not yet been charged
8493490 i think its fantastic i like the traditional kits i think we should wear kits that represent the history of the club and this one certainly does that
8493491 this club has a great history we respect the legends and its great for us to put a shirt on that remembers a great team i think its beautiful
8493492 were still missing that part the enthusiasm im hoping well pick that part up as we go
8493493 we get a couple of big kills a match but not as many as i think we should i havent seen the team yet that i saw in the summer
8493494 that was important for us to get off to a quick start with a couple of nice hits one we need to do that against better teams we cant afford slow starts
8493495 two hopefully we can get the other team down like today and never let them back in it
8493496 we served very well again only missing two that is a team strength
8493497 the only real negative i saw was consistent passing we didnt pass as well as we need to these girls like the set close to the net that might have been a reason we didnt get a lot of big hits plus we didnt get much of a chance to block
8493498 we knew this was going to be historic when this began one way or another whether it was sen obama or sen clinton we knew we would have our first woman nominee or our first african american nominee
8493499 its a great step forward and it reminds us that america is a very special place
8493500 the democrats have accomplished something truly staggering 45 years after mlk offered a dream of simple equality they have nominated a black man to lead us obama and his party have shattered a barrier that many before him would never have imagined could be overcome
8493501 this is the first national convention ive ever wanted to go to for exactly that reason
8493502 i think its wonderful because our great country less than 50 years after dr king marched on washington for basic civil rights a party of our country has nominated an african american to be our leader and it is because as dr king said the content of his character and not the color of his skin this is a huge historic achievement for our country and reminds us of the greatness of america

8493539 its important to understand that the justices on the mexican supreme court serve only one 15 year term and unlike their american counterparts many of them go on to continue to serve in some official capacity
8493540 it means that future challenges to this law are possible
8493541 the pro family groups in mexico are fighting a valiant fight they will need our continued prayers and support but as we see the tide of socialism taking over the americas pro lifers working in the international realm will begin to see an exponential rise of legal attacks against the unborn
8493542 my daughter is a senior this is her last year

8493546 a lot of the young people with whom im working went double barreled into it the campaign

8493552 the roads in new zealand have a good rhythm and they are so smooth that theres no need to worry about damaging the car on rocks
8493553 its important to win rallies for our title challenges but if i cant do that then i have to score as many points as possible
8493554 i have always enjoyed this rally ever since i first came here in 2002 the lush green backdrop to the stages is magnificent

8493558 if thats what it takes to defend all american citizens my son will fight for this country
8493559 a number of outlets try to make their business to turn her into a divisive problematic person
8493560 rescuers sighed a breath of relief when they observed sgt matthew tarleton exiting the heavy wooded area with the two young children on the back of his police atv
8493561 the facility in the welcome center is pretty well full we are looking at alternatives and the location at exit 8 is larger and can handle many more people
8493562 i see this as a win from nashuas perspective lozeau said
8493563 people are flocking to the buses and we are connecting the routes with our city bus service so people will be able take a local bus to catch the bus to boston
8493564 if the welcome center becomes a substation then you are left with even fewer spaces for those taking commuter buses
8493565 often it will bounce back and the whole application will be denied
8493566 right now n h catholic charities is the only one that offers these kinds of low income programs
8493567 this is a way they can get the process done with an official attorney for 50
8493568 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8493569 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8493570 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8493571 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8493572 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8493581 we collected hundreds of names on petitions did letter writing to let rite aid know that the historic district was not an appropriate location for a 10 000 square foot retail store
8493582 i was chairman when we purchased woodmont orchards and other parcels hundreds of acres of farmland and forest preserved in perpetuity
8493583 i never asked taxpayers for a single dollar that wasnt recommended by the budget committee

8493591 i have five grandchildren and i wonder what kind of world will their grandchildren have
8493592 we understand how badly the people are hurting there because we knew tons of people who worked at those factories
8493593 with plane fare hotel and extra expenses it would have been way over 1 000 and im on a very fixed income
8493594 its too bad the days are gone when hard working immigrants could become part of the middle class and my heart goes out to people trying to keep or buy a house nowadays since taxes heating and other rising costs are making this less possible
8493595 this republican trickle down idea it evaporates before it gets down to anybody else
8493596 here are five tips for anyone planning to take the bold step of moving without a job lined up
8493597 know how long your money will last plan on a minimum of three months without a paycheck you would be wise to plan for six months unless you can embark on the trip feeling your funds will be well spent no matter what comes of it dont do it
8493598 be ready for anything in order to get the job you really want depending on the market you may have to be willing to accept all different sorts of assignments in the interim child care dog walking bartending thats part of the reason relocating without a job is typically more attractive to people in their 20s you may not have to walk dogs for months but opportunities tend to multiply and if you begin to accept one or two jobs youre likely to find others in the future
8493599 i feel sad that i dont know what happened to her i am sure her family would love to have some closure so would i
8493600 its never dawned on me that she might be dead
8493601 i always thought she might be in trouble i think i have always believed that she ran for her life
8493602 but there was something wrong with the guy his stories often changed
8493603 there was some conjecture that he tried to burn the body
8493604 it looked like as if you had dug a hole and filled it up
8493605 there was a lot to point to it being john
8493606 out of the blue a strange woman shows up and says she wanted to adopt only those cats
8493607 this is a very positive development but were taking nothing for granted and will keep working diligently to make it a reality
8493608 this could do what we all desire and that is to preserve new hampshires unique role in the process if not strengthen it into the future
8493609 senator mccain has been our strongest ally because he understands more than anyone else that the people of new hampshire vet the candidates and give everyone respect and a chance for them all to make their case mahoney continued
8493610 the fact is we are again heading towards a bipolar world not one shaped by a balance of terror like the old one but certainly not a multi polar one in fact one heavily influenced by two countries the united states and china
8493611 were seeing the development of a multi polar world whether the american republicans like it or not
8493612 based on the events that transpired in the camper it has been preliminarily determined that the actions of both trooper gaiser and chief julian were justified under the law
8493613 viewed the situation as non lethal one involving the removal of a belligerent intoxicated and non compliant individual
8493614 when he entered the camper he did not know that anthony jarvis was a felon or that he was suspected of being in possession of a weapon
8493615 immediately upon entering trooper gaiser saw a muzzle flash and felt a bullet pass close by his head
8493616 trooper gaiser fired his taser and at the same moment was fired on again by anthony jarvis a bullet struck trooper gaiser in the upper right thigh and he fell to the floor
8493617 there were differing accounts among the law enforcement members present as to the specific legal basis and purpose for entry into anthony jarvis camper
8493618 even if anthony jarvis believed that the officers had no authority to enter he was not legally justified in using deadly force against trooper gaiser

8493658 y en ning n momento me dijeron qu tipo de medicaci n era ni para qu serv a
8493659 que todo era normal y que las pruebas se las realizar an al d a siguiente
8493660 me dijo mam dame un beso porque eres la mejor madre del mundo muri en mis brazos avis sal corriendo llamando a voces a los m dicos pero ya era tarde ni el boca a boca pudo salvarla
8493661 si muri por asfixia por sus propios v mitos por qu no le cortaron esos v mitos por qu no se la llevaron a un hospital de granada por qu no le hicieron pruebas en el momento

8493664 a todos se les qued muy mala cara cuando sucedi esto pues se trata de un equipo de m dicos j venes en un hospital nuevo donde hay mucha ilusi n por hacer bien las cosas y as se refleja en las felicitaciones de la mayor a de nuestros usuarios
8493665 no me gustar a marcharme hasta por lo menos la ltima semana de septiembre felipe empieza en el colegio y me gustar a acompa arlo y recogerlo a la salida de clase aunque sea al principio
8493666 a veces me siento identificado con el protagonista de el dilema un concienzudo cient fico que trabajaba en el departamento de i d de una multinacional al que despiden injustamente y cuando va a pedir empleo como profesor en un instituto porque necesita el dinero siempre le responden que est demasiado cualificado para esta tarea y que dudan de que pueda ser un buen docente
8493667 te planteas las cosas de otra forma porque ya no est s solo buscas el bienestar de tu mujer de tu hijo mi esposa es una persona muy apegada a los suyos no he visto una familia m s unida que la de ella y me siento mal cuando pienso en lo traum tico que le resultar a tener que dejarlos atr s seguro que sufrir a mucho como el peque o que ha nacido aqu y que ahora ir al colegio en el barrio
8493668 me encuentro con dificultades hasta para homologar mi titulaci n
8493669 deutschland liegt in diesem jahr deutlich ber unseren eigenen erwartungen
8493670 unternehmen untersch tzen h ufig den aufwand und die komplexit t die mit einem gro projekt verbunden sind au erdem ist oft falsch verstandenes kostenbewusstsein ein ausschlaggeber f r eine nicht der komplexit t und dem anspruch angemessene projektmanagementstruktur
8493671 die politik hat bislang in weiten teilen versagt die regierungen gleichen rzten die dem todkranken patienten ostsee trotz eindeutiger diagnose die rettende medizin verweigern
8493672 das ergebnis ist sehr ern chternd weil kein land die ostsee umfassend sch tzt wir brauchen bundesliga format um dieses einzigartige meer zu retten dass deutschland jetzt tabellenf hrer auf kreisliganiveau ist kann kein ruhekissen sein
8493673 durch das intensive d ngen in den sp tfr hlingsmonaten gelangen allj hrlich gro e mengen von d ngemittel in die meere
8493674 seit geraumer zeit gibt es bereits eine ballastwasser konvention doch ist diese in den meisten anrainerstaaten noch immer nicht ratifiziert unter anderem auch nicht von deutschland
8493675 nur im bottischen meerbusen zwischen schweden und finnland ist die belastung mittlerweile so hoch dass dort gefangener fisch nicht mehr in die eu importiert werden darf
8493676 alles was ich w hrend meiner acht jahre als pr sident und in meiner arbeit danach gelernt habe berzeugt mich barack obama ist der mann f r den job
8493677 thats it kenny get out kenny you better make some phone calls
8493678 no buddy no stop buddy stop it buddy you better make some phone calls
8493679 stop that screaming what did i say about no screaming
8493680 agrees with you on everything but you dont think that person can deliver on anything
8493681 l on a pas fait le meilleure choix en le suivant
8493682 we dont have enough money to pay the rent to pay the electric to pay the phone
8493683 the challenge is prices are rising around us but paychecks are the same
8493684 our agencies are telling us theyre seeing a good 30 to 40 percent increase in individuals that theyre serving food to
8493685 im seeing families having to make choices between food and fuel or clothing for their children
8493686 theyre working minimum wage minimum hour jobs with no health care no benefits theyre one illness away from bankruptcy
8493687 we dont need to be playing these games obviously you see in the league that guys are getting hurt you dont need to play obviously with us having a long season last year going to the super bowl playing more games in the preseason and having a risk of injuries is not smart
8493688 since ive been playing i dont think half of us have played that last preseason game
8493689 a lot is said about how preseason doesnt necessarily count but in a sense it does
8493690 not in the matter of wins or losses but in the matter of preparation and its our last game to get preparation its big for us and its another opportunity to gain some consistency within the offensive unit
8493691 what you would like to do is have a chance to play a lot of young guys and let them play and put them in situations and let them fend for themselves
8493692 but obviously when the game is over you want them all standing tall and ready to go the next week too
8493693 theyre just coming in to finish off their preseason and we are going out to do the same
8493694 we are going out to win that is the only difference
8493695 im going to pretty busy but it was a good opportunity to get some public company experience
8493696 would continue to act as an excellent steward for the watershed for the towns that we serve
8493697 and that had a lot to do with my decision
8493698 its a great honor said albert who is currently curriculum coordinator for physical education at newton mass
8493699 but i couldnt have done it without the great group of players i played with
8493700 i dont know because we have not reached a decision yet so obviously i couldnt say
8493701 id like to make a decision yesterday you know but we just havent done that yet
8493702 looking forward to coming out to dayton and having a great rally
8493703 were going to be demonstrating on sen mccains continuation of bush trade policies which have cost the miami valley over 33 000 jobs over the last eight years
8493704 job security is a thing of the past in dayton
8493705 we cannot continue to afford the schools and growth we have now
8493706 the thing is he wants to pitch powerfully and im saying no
8493707 regrettably we are not surprised that mr boras would attempt to raise a meritless legal claim in an effort to compel us to renegotiate pedros contract to one more to his liking
8493708 we are however disappointed that pedro would allow his agent to pursue this claim on his behalf pedro showed tremendous fortitude and independent thinking when he agreed to his contract august 15
8493709 they have two balls go a total of 50 feet they get a run out of each one and they win the game
8493710 you just tip your cap to them for being able to go out and manufacture stuff like that
8493711 one ball left the infield and they got two runs so what can you do ill tell you i feel like i did pretty well today especially against that offense
8493712 zach threw the ball well changed speeds worked down gave us eight solid innings
8493713 honestly im just going to keep building on the work that ive been doing
8493714 even when he got behind he found a way to make his pitch
8493715 ive felt ive thrown pretty well for a while now
8493716 ive just worked to be as consistent as possible make my pitches get guys out
8493717 its a little unusual watching him pitch and seeing all that he gets behind his pitches
8493718 im happy for him glad hes here hes worked really hard and he deserves the chance
8493719 it has happened before but its not a frequent occurrence
8493720 we continually refine and update our procedures and do our best to protect the systems on the station
8493721 im not going to speculate on how this could have happened
8493722 our expedition 17 crew on the station is working with flight control and engineering teams and with our international partners to identify and eradicate the virus thats on board and well look for any actions we can take to prevent that from happening again
8493723 gamers are the second most targeted group malware authors go after and chances are that any password and account combination thats stolen could be reused on other sites
8493724 needs to look at this as a wake up call and they need to look closely at their policies
8493725 things are not locked down or as tight as they should be
8493726 look at real strong management and real strong policy enforcement
8493727 it is the unions obligation on behalf of all players to defend the integrity of its collectively bargained agreements
8493728 he would say this is how its going to be going forward
8493729 it is settled law that the arbitration panel has no authority to disturb such minor league contracts
8493730 the office has assured us that we have a valid contract with pedro and that it will vigorously defend any claim to the contrary
8493731 regrettably we are not surprised that mr boras would attempt to raise a meritless legal claim in an effort to compel us to renegotiate pedros contract to one more to his liking
8493732 the pirates violated major league baseball rules and have issued a nearly 600 word statement to make their actions out to be my fault i think its time for the pirates and mr coonelly to come clean with the fans of pittsburgh and let everyone know about their dealings with pedro alvarez
8493733 willing and ready to pay pedro a 6 million signing bonus
8493734 mr boras is apparently satisfied with the 6 million bonus he secured for mr hosmer and has not challenged the validity of that contract
8493735 despite our disappointment we continue to believe in pedro alvarez the person and the baseball player and remain excited to add pedro to our system
8493736 we will sit down with pedro and his family as soon as mr boras claim is rejected to chart a new and much more productive start to pedros career with the pittsburgh pirates
8493737 our sales tax dollars are going out of the county and we need more sales tax dollars here
8493738 henderson has done well in their enrollment in these last year and ouachita baptist is showing an increase in enrollment this year
8493739 we would expect the great majority of our people would not be in favor of changing the policy
8493740 i sat in my chair in my living room in total disbelief
8493741 as i sat there i had to ask myself am i really seeing this in my lifetime
8493742 i would always say to the audience that i believe one day the people in this country will elect a qualified black to the presidency of the united states
8493743 what i withheld from the audience was that i never thought i would live to see it in my lifetime
8493744 i just think the party has opened up and what were starting to see is the democratic party is demonstrating that its open and that all americans are included
8493745 wir m ssen den heimatlos gewordenen anh ngern der spd ich nenne sie die johannes rau w hler ein angebot machen
8493746 wir wundern uns dass johannes rau in seinen reden h ufiger genannt wird als helmut kohl
8493747 schlie lich hat rau die notwendigen reformma nahmen verhindert mit dem ziel eine landesidentit t zu schaffen
8493748 mit den stimmen von israels feinden zum bundespr sidenten w hlen lassen
8493749 es w rde uns gefallen wenn langj hrige weggef hrte von johannes rau ein wort der distanzierung f nden zu dem was r ttgers da versucht
8493750 es sollten nicht nur die jetzt noch aktiven weggef hrten raus auf distanz zu r ttgers gehen
8493751 this transaction if its successful will take thepressure off them
8493752 hey ill talk to you another time when i feel better or whatever the deal is
8493753 i may not know what youre saying but i know youre upset and its ok
8493754 the company has indicated its projected growth goingforward is slightly lower than they had previously forecast
8493755 she shot me with an arrow of which the feathers were the eye lashes an arrow which did not strike the outer part of my skin but cleft my heart
8493756 go with your diamonds and lashes of jet and do not thank me your beauty is reward enough
8493757 las visitas que ha recibido durante estos d as de los vecinos y de otros alcaldes han sido lo que le ha dado muchas fuerzas

8493762 por lo menos lo que he hecho ha merecido la pena

8493764 manuel chaves ha anticipado que para el a o pr ximo los fondos de nivelaci n de la junta ascender n un 25
8493765 quiz s no es suficiente pero es un buen comienzo
8493766 porque hay que cuidar la salud y no debe poner en riesgo su vida
8493767 porque ellos llevaban la mejora de la financiaci n local en sus programas electorales de la junta y el gobierno as como en el estatuto de autonom a
8493768 yo se lo agradezco de todo coraz n a los dos porque s que lo dicen preocup ndose por m y sin intenciones pol ticas pero me compromet con mis vecinos a mantener el encierro hasta el d a 31 y eso es lo que voy a hacer el domingo por la ma ana recoger las pancartas y me ir a mi casa donde me tomar una manzanilla con az car que es lo que me ha dicho el m dico que tengo que tomar antes de comer
8493769 i ran to stand up for all those who have been invisible to this government and they are the reason i support barack obama

8493781 im willing to appoint a receiver but i want to know who will pay for one
8493782 everyone got ungodly tax benefits and credits and then walked away from it
8493783 the city of oakland has a vested interest in having a successful low income housing program
8493784 we will get our economy going again and the best way to do that is through job creation
8493785 i think the worst thing you can do is raise taxes in a poor economy and sen obama wants to raise taxes i want to keep them low
8493786 sen mccain wants to give 4 billion in tax breaks to oil companies
8493787 sen obama wont raise taxes on americans making less than 250 000 a year
8493788 i want to cut business taxes so theyll stay in the united states and create additional jobs
8493789 if there is any good news about our economy it is our increase in exports i think its very important that we have open markets around the world
8493790 we have people who are sitting around the kitchen table figuring out how theyre going to afford their health care and educate their kids and many of whom have recently and suddenly lost a job
8493791 if we werent preparing them for jobs that are here right now we wouldnt have an enrollment of 24 000 students we wouldnt exist
8493792 the market demands that we prepare people for the jobs that exist and will exist
8493793 the bottom line however is that the strong negative trend in summertime ice extent characterizing the past decade continues
8493794 we could have no ice at the north pole at the end of this summer and the reason here is that the thin ice and this ice we call first year ice the ice that tends to melt out in the summer
8493795 its possible that ships could sail from alaska right to the north pole
8493796 clearly if you look over what we have seen in the past three years and where we were headed we are in this long term decline and we may have no ice at all in the in summer by 2030 or so
8493797 uneuforia inimmaginabile a gaza sabato le nostre barche sono state accolte da decine di migliaia di persone in festa e in questi tre giorni stiamo ottenendo risultati incredibili scortiamo i pescherecci a pescare al largo mettiamo in rete fra loro le ong locali facciamo pressione agli ospedali israeliani affinch accettino di curare malati gravi palestinesi

8493800 non pensavamo che ci avrebbero lasciato passare invece cos successo
8493801 solo perch allingresso in israele avevo dichiarato che sarei andato nei territori palestinesi a partecipare a un seminario sulla non violenza
8493802 centinaia di persone ci fermano per stringerci la mano per dirci che siamo i loro liberatori e ringraziarci per aver fatto breccia nel silenzio mediatico generale che nasconde la situazione della striscia al mondo
8493803 che finalmente capiscono che il problema della palestina riguarda anche loro
8493804 la pi eclatante stata ieri quando con una delle due barche abbiamo scortati sette pescherecci di gaza a pescare a dieci miglia dalla costa quando normalmente non vanno al di l di due tre miglia perch la marina israeliana li blocca
8493805 hanno raccolto sei volte la quantit di pesce giornaliera stato un trionfo
8493806 si limitata a posizionare le navi da guerra sulla nostra rotta senza mai per passare a provocazioni pi serie mentre pescavamo ci hanno circondati sembravamo piccoli pesci attorniato da un branco di enormi squali
8493807 qui le ong simpatizzano per uno o per laltro partito palestinese che per hamas chi per fatah che sono in costante lotta fra loro ma grazie al nostro arrivo si sono ricompattate una vittoria anche questa speriamo sia da esempio per i piani pi alti

8493821 the woman who writes creatively and with integrity is the last person we should look to if our concern is with drawing a clear line between madness and sanity
8493822 he says that with my imaginative power and habit of story making a nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to all manner of excited fancies and that i ought to use my will and good sense to check the tendency
8493823 but i must say what i feel and think in some way it is such a relief

8493829 he was traveling a long way but she would watch him she was his mother and it was all she could do for now she could do it she was weak and the world was very shaky but the light of other days shone steadily and showed the truth she was no longer bewildered and the next time martin came to stand hopefully beside her bed she smiled at him and spoke to him in her ordinary voice

8493831 the journals and prose of women writers reveal how difficult it has often been for them to both live and reflect on their living in their art
8493832 it is time to see how these lives the growing up the marrying the vowing virginity the longing the being poor the going crazy and carrying on the loving the children how these experiences have been perceived by some of the best modern writers who happen to have lived these lives themselves

8493837 the membership is concerned and upset with the boards unwillingness to work with our negotiators to resolve the outstanding issues
8493838 we are continuing to serve the students of beaver local schools three weeks beyond the expiration of the contract in hopes the board will recognize that we are giving them a last opportunity to negotiate in good faith and avoid a strike
8493839 i am troubled by what appear to be inconsistencies in the forensic evaluation as compared to statements obtained by the sheriffs department as to the circumstances of the shooting
8493840 all indications are that the son was involved in the shooting
8493841 the husband may have been in another area of the home at the time of the shooting
8493842 were focusing on the fact that were in the sports entertainment business and we have to interact with fans and sponsors
8493843 we want to emphasize to our players that they need to be approachable

8493845 having served the past 30 years at the county sheriffs office the last eight of which were as county sheriff i can assure you that it is difficult for me to say goodbye but the time has come for me to close this chapter of my life and open up a new one
8493846 i am especially grateful to all of the officers and staff at the sheriffs department they have stuck by me through thick and thin through tight budgetary times and through many a difficult challenge on the job
8493847 above all else i want to thank the good citizens of columbiana county who have favored me with their vote these past two terms thank you one and all
8493848 a cohesive effective and well trained department that is fair and impartial yet tough on crime

8493864 holmes deciphered the very same series of drawings in what his biographer called the adventure of the dancing men
8493865 its quite simple really using a very basic frequency analysis you take the most commonly found figure assuming that it is the letter e and taking it from there holmes himself describes fully how to crack the cipher within the story

8493873 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8493874 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8493875 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8493876 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack

8493879 his chiranjeevis maiden political speech at the temple town of tirupati on tuesday was virtually silent on key issues facing the state it was only a cinematic rhetoric
8493880 there was no clarity on important issues like telanagana categorization of scheduled castes and naxalism he also did not spell out his partys policies and programmes

8493887 the script which is available for free is called cfg2html and from my experience so far i must say it does a more weekend humor of the linux and unix variety

8493892 pray that this program will have series two and three and four its very strategic for our young viewers since age two
8493893 the lack of government response is alarming to say the least the national government of india must step up to the plate and get orissa officials like shri naveen patnaik to act at this point the lack of any serious response from orissa officials looks to the entire world as complicity with the radical hindus that are doing the actual damage orissa officials should be held accountable and the biju janata dal bjp coalition government should step down
8493894 where we had programs the christians are no longer living there in cases where they havent fled there is enough fear created where it will be a while before they have the courage to gather together whether it be in a church service or childrens program or in the evening with our literacy classes

8493900 establishment of committees and task force teams to restructure various components of fijian institutions that relate directly to land and the fijian administration including the gcc without reference to relevant constitutional procedures
8493901 we are deeply concerned that this has been done through exploitation of the office of the president
8493902 such an act in fijian custom is a great insult in terms of fijian protocol and itovo vakaturaga and itovo vakavanua
8493903 yes the contract has ended two days ago and fmf was a very small part of our business anyway
8493904 no that is not true that is all wrong the contract is still on and it is going to be long term so our vty business is operating normally
8493905 there is no other way of amending the constitution without calling parliament
8493906 in a state where the economy is declining the balance of payments is under pressure and inflation is rising
8493907 this harsh climate presented very difficult policy choices between growth and safeguarding the balance of payments
8493908 we decided to impose a ceiling on commercial banks lending in december which remained throughout 2007
8493909 this will continue to be our long term strategy however to help stabilise our financial outflows after december 2006 selective tightening of exchange controls was chosen to help retain foreign exchange
8493910 i have been through three coups two of them where we were democratically elected and we were never given that power back again so mr qarase should learn from this and drop the idea that he will get his government back

8493914 tuesday was extraordinary it was limits for everybody and the fish were nice 8 to 11 pounds with the occasional 12 or 13 today has been maybe not as good but still more limits than not
8493915 one guy told me tuesday that he had to catch 17 coho to get his limit of four for two anglers and i said what a day but i would say the mark rate overall has been about 40 percent
8493916 a guy i know who went out monday morning was done by 9 15 with limits of coho up to 14 pounds
8493917 he was fishing right at the buoy but there are fish being taken upstream too
8493918 it should start out with a bang on monday both in terms of effort and catch
8493919 were beside ourselves were so excited to see joe biden
8493920 he actually when my father died tragically this year personally sent me a note i didnt contact him or anything he just found out and he always reaches out to touch people and thats the way he is hes a real person and hes going to be a real vice president of the united states
8493921 its a great opportunity for delaware and its a great opportunity for the rest of the country because weve got a winning ticket here
8493922 part of sen bidens personality is that he is a straight shooter

8493926 i explained what she was doing i didnt mention your name she said all the same things you did
8493927 andrea i resent that you think your time is more valuable than mine i feel if you had time to write me a note giving me direct orders to send someone else your message than you certainly have the time to contact them yourself
8493928 btw i never once replied to her demands about deleting you she doesnt even know we chat shes under the impression that your floating around my friends list amp i have no clue your even here
8493929 at present rises in prices are confined to those for energyand food so were not seeing a knock on effect on overallprices under which inflation and wage growth spiral higher
8493930 the key to why global inflation pressure does not spreadmuch in japan is a lack of strength in wage growth
8493931 i expect global commodity prices to sustain a gradual upwardtrend but in the near term they are expected to stabilise asglobal economic growth slows
8493932 crude oil prices have fallen about 20 percent from theirpeak in mid july
8493933 maybe we are a little bit crazy maybe we are just bored

8493942 this time why dont you just take a cab to the airport
8493943 from whatever reports ive got the situation is not under control but the state government has assured that it will soon improve
8493944 the state govt is saying that maoists have killed him but that is not true
8493945 i think he took us to a good place in the game
8493946 i wanted to go deep into the game but i threw a lot of pitches and fell behind
8493947 its been three years that ive been of age to vote but i havent been able to vote this will allow me to put in my choice my decision
8493948 im excited im excited i look forward to it ive been following politics for a very long time and now i can actually vote and do my part as a citizen
8493949 generally its a safe bet that if youve naturalized by the first of october that should give you plenty of time to register to vote
8493950 everything excellent training and opportunity to establish a career professionally develop myself as well as now im granted the privilege to be a citizen

8493953 its a dangerous document because it can have a lot of negative impacts in the lives of fiji citizens especially fijians
8493954 its a principle of law that a penalty should match the seriousness of the crime
8493955 how would he feel if his own child is killed by a gun
8493956 i think its best for them to see the graves of these innocent kids that have been killed in this country as a result of their own practices
8493957 i am begging them for the love of this country to please come forward and speak to the police if they are aware of any gun anywhere
8493958 you dont know who is going to be the next victim we cannot wait until death starts knocking on everyones doors
8493959 there is no doubt we have disrupted an organised criminal group who have been supplying large quantities of automatic weapons and ammunition into criminal networks
8493960 there are links to seven murders where the weapon has been these mac 10s
8493961 there is also the tragic murder of pc sharon beshenivsky where this wasnt the murder weapon but a mac 10 was discharged at the scene
8493962 none of these shootings or murders occurred in the thames valley police area and i think the criminals involved have been very careful not to conduct any activity in the thames valley so as not to draw any police attention to it

8493983 if we adopt it by the next meeting the moratorium falls off
8493984 this is the first i heard of this problem its an enforcement issue i have to talk to the building inspector and see what information he has to see if there are any violations
8493985 we were always responsible people we never thought anything like this would happen to us
8493986 when we hear somebody speak of a baby when we hear a friend or colleague speak of being out drinking when we hear a fire engine or an ambulance
8493987 knowing it was the only 45 minutes that i would ever get to spend with her
8493988 a sea change in the cultural acceptance of drunken driving or lack thereof the city of boston is home to thousands and thousands of college students so we need to double our efforts
8493989 failure at some point in everyones life in inevitable but giving up is unforgivable
8493990 barack obama will bring down health care costs by 2 500 for the typical family
8493991 now let me ask you whose judgment should we trust
8493992 he still had a pulse he was semiconscious his eyes were open but he wasnt talking
8493993 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver the change everybody knows we need barack obama will deliver that change
8493994 i think michelle obama kicked it off pretty well dont you think
8493995 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house down last night
8493996 what its like when youve got a president who actually puts people first thank you president clinton

8493999 all of us here at the new york anime festival are honored to have chef morimoto join us this year
8494000 masaharu morimoto has done more to expose america to japanese cooking than perhaps any other chef in the last decade and we are eager to give him a platform in americas biggest city to celebrate his accomplishments and open a few more hearts minds and bellies to japanese cuisine
8494001 anarchy media player wp spam plugin best free stuff computerworld
8494002 so you take the carrots and go fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck just like that
8494003 the choice in this election is clear these times require more than a good soldier
8494004 they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need
8494005 ive never seen a time when washington has watched so many people get knocked down without doing anything to help them get back up
8494006 thats the america that george bush has left us and thats the future john mccain will give us
8494007 as we gather here tonight our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8494008 should we trust john mccains judgment when he says there can be no timelines to draw down our troops from iraq that we must stay indefinitely
8494009 or should we listen to barack obama who says shift the responsibility to the iraqis and set a time to bring our combat troops home
8494010 joe biden is right we need more than a good soldier we need a leader with the experience and judgment to serve as commander in chief from day one
8494011 you can learn an awful lot about a man campaigning with him debating him and seeing how he reacts under pressure you learn about the strength of his mind but even more importantly you learn about the quality of his heart
8494012 i watched how barack touched people how he inspired them and i realized he has tapped into the oldest belief in america we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8494013 it is pretty clear that biden brings real blue collar credentials to obama
8494014 help put obama over the top the military expertise will also allow folks to feel a bit less insecure about obamas credentials
8494015 often the person who comes up with a new invention is not the ideal person to commercialize it
8494016 new businesses starting out on their own fail at a rate of 4 out of 5
8494017 but in a business incubator scenario better than 50 percent succeed
8494018 you dont want the professor to write up a white paper and publish their discovery in a journal before the idea is protected
8494019 first we get a patent to protect the inventor the university and future investors who may be interested in licensing the invention or starting up a new company around the idea
8494020 there are over 7000 industrial technology centers around the world and techtown is one of them
8494021 while some of these are found in universities many are also about technology transfer between countries and cultures
8494022 no they usually prefer the world of academia they do receive their share of royalties and if a company is formed around an idea they may become a consultant or board member but usually they continue as before teaching classes or conducting their research
8494023 we do a very large volume of work given the number of research projects we do here
8494024 in 2007 we had 329 disclosures which resulted in 144 patents and of those our department helped 91 find their way to commercialization
8494025 in fact seven of those ideas created new start up companies
8494026 the success of getting a patent to market involves many people and factors including changing market conditions so we focus on the practical
8494027 our focus is on economic development by creating jobs through applied research that moves projects to reality through our commercial partners
8494028 while lawrence tech owns only about 50 patents our students and faculty work on real world projects that result in new product development and commercialization for the companies we work with and create hundreds of jobs for students whove worked on those projects
8494029 within a month after graduation a remarkable 93 percent of our students are either working in their field or pursuing advanced educational opportunities
8494030 the bayh dole act opened the doors for technology transfer in 1980 by allowing schools to keep the ip rights for all research
8494031 until the bayh dole act government funded research all ended up as property of the u s government and then most of it sat unused and wasted this law incentivized the schools to provide patent protection and pursue commercialization by keeping the ip rights for themselves and the inventors
8494032 these findings underscore the need for physicians and nurses involved in the care of cancer patients to recognize encourage promote and take advantage of these traits in their patients to help them more effectively manage their cancer care so that they ultimately can achieve a better quality of life

8494038 the notion that you can train doctors to completely avoid mistakes is just false

8494040 the menu for the last dinner contains only one fish entry but it is an unbeatable one lightly poached atlantic salmon topped with a rich mousseline sauce and garnished with sliced cucumbers a mousseline sauce is simply a classic hollandaise to which some whipped cram has been added
8494041 we are going to communicate to preach the gospel to share the gospel with sports fans as they tailgate and mill around stadiums before they go in
8494042 what we do is to distribute it like a player card on one side its their picture the back side is their christian testimony at the bottom is a web site so our mission is to distribute as much as possible
8494043 tailgate with the fans and have sort of a deeper relationship in that area where were tailgating
8494044 our intention is to start by giving out the cards then get into conversations and the more volunteers you have the more conversations you can have thats really the big push this fall
8494045 relational dynamics can take work if youre out there all the time relationships can develop and the deeper conversations can occur but youve got to be out there consistently
8494046 weve rented a space in their sponsor area so we have an official presence called rec fest at georgia tech were going to have a television showing players testimonies using some athletes in action dvds were going to do a little giveaway to get people to sign up to receive emails and put up a prayer request stand and thats how were going to start off

8494054 i think theres a strong argument for saying that more of the training which occurs can be done in regional and country areas where theres less population and where there are valuable job opportunities
8494055 theoretically it should be impossible for two planes to collide so theres been obviously a failure a serious failure somewhere in the system but im advised that training there has been undertaken for many many years with a good safety record
8494056 i think one of the things that we would like to see over time is more of this sort of training undertaken in less densely populated areas and i suspect thats one of the things that may come out of the reports
8494057 its one of the busiest airports in australia i think there are something like 500 000 air movements there each year its also im advised one of the safest but obviously we want to ensure that the airports are as safe as possible
8494058 its a principle of law that a penalty should match the seriousness of the crime
8494059 whatever is happening politically the bottom line is tomorrow morning the government is going to have to make a decision about building two power stations which are going to cost upwards of 10 billion
8494060 it doesnt have the money and it is going to come out of schools transport and other infrastructure budgets or alternatively the state will start to go into dangerous levels of debt
8494061 the business community is not only dismayed that it has happened it is confused by how it has happened because anybody who understands government finances and the energy issue thinks there was no alternative to privatisation
8494062 nsw now has a very dangerous situation where it cant invite the private sector to help fund this important infrastructure and it doesnt have the money in the forward estimates of the budget to do it itself
8494063 the defeat of the electricity sale is extremely disappointing and will have serious implications on the development of new transport infrastructure in nsw
8494064 it means that taxpayers money will stay tied up in obsolete coal fired power generators instead of being re invested in critical capacity building urban transport projects such as the m4 east and the proposed metro rail system
8494065 we would urge the liberal party to certainly reconsider supporting the sale this should be seen as bigger than politics
8494066 this is in the states long term interest and it shouldnt be viewed as a short term issue
8494067 the bottom line however is that the strong negative trend in summertime ice extent characterising the past decade continues
8494068 the victims that prosecutors are electing to proceed with at this time said jane robison a spokeswoman for the district attorneys office
8494069 i left with my husband and a group of other migrants we were led by a broker whom we met in addis who took us to nazareth and then to harar
8494070 i left addis ababa after my brother was killed in the violence that followed the elections in 2005 i did not feel safe and was tired of the violence the trip was dangerous but i prayed day and night to get through it
8494071 some brokers took our money and delivered on their promises but others were very bad and cruel
8494072 it took us 30 days to do the journey from addis ababa to bosasso including walking the last four days to reach bosasso which is not what we thought it to be the place is was very very hot and we had no one to help us we had no money so we had to do odd jobs that came our way
8494073 i had to serve tea to customers and at night we slept fitfully under corrugated roofs in front of buildings if you are lucky you get to sleep in one of the shanty tea stalls i spent about us 300 to come to bosasso but now we have to raise 100 for the trip to yemen to pay the smugglers
8494074 then i became pregnant and as it was impossible to make all the money to go back my husband and i decided that he would go first and then send for me unfortunately my husband died on the way and now it is just me and my nine month old girl sabrina
8494075 i love my country ethiopia but i cannot go back now and i cannot stay in bosasso there is no life here for me and my daughter it is not a trip i would wish for anyone i must find a better life for my daughter and will continue to reach oil rich countries for better life
8494076 family is shaping the content of the entire day and thats not been done before
8494077 he let me know the world was large and that i should get to know as much of it as possible
8494078 they want to contrast the story of obama who has been through struggles that many americans are now facing with mccain who seems increasingly out of touch
8494079 filled with black rage against white people and hatred of the united states
8494080 the challenge is to avoid anything that smacks of angry black woman and get her back into the kitchen the question is whether she is willing to go along with that

8494119 i am comfortable with the current policy i believe we need to give the second half of 2008 a little time to see if the scenario that i personally am counting on plays out more or less according to plan
8494120 many markets continue to be strained it seems to me that we have to continue to be very vigilant about the status of the financial markets and their potential negative impact on the general economy
8494121 the banking system is experiencing a lot of strain and some banks are in very difficult circumstances we continue to monitor banks in this particular part of the country and a number of them are facing liquidity strains and asset quality strains
8494122 with weak growth and financial market strains i believe the most likely outcome is that both headline and core inflation will diminish over the rest of 2008 and into next year as the temporary effects of energy and food price increases abate
8494123 i think the stabilization of the dollar which we hope will hold the stabilization has helped and the inter play between the dollar and commodity prices might also have an influence on the dampening of those pressures
8494124 the almost 30 drop in oil prices has certainly helped and we believe it will play through to the headline inflation number in the second half of 2008
8494125 if overall prices do not moderate in the near term as i expect inflation expectations could become unmoored
8494126 inflation expectations may have risen modestly but not by a material degree
8494127 let me emphasize that i am mindful of todays elevated risks and am prepared at any point to change tactics to ensure inflation expectations do not become unanchored
8494128 its not enough to be correct or reasonable or even brilliant

8494163 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas

8494177 gt rs were only available in japan occasionally australia and they always had right hand drive
8494178 partly because they were not available here they became forbidden fruit and they developed an underground following in the united states hard core car enthusiasts know about godzilla
8494179 thats the whole point we wanted to make this car so that it is a multipurpose vehicle if you want to drive like your hairs on fire it will do that pretty well
8494180 or you can use it like a normal car to cruise back and forth to work in comfort it will do that well too
8494181 wanted to be able to carry out a normal conversation between driver and passenger at 186 miles an hour so theres very little wind noise or other interior noise
8494182 you hear it and you think to yourself what the heck is going on back there but the sounds are normal thats all because of the transmissions being located in the rear so yes youll have some discomfiting sounds
8494183 theres also hydraulic pumps back there engaging and disengaging the clutches as you go and theres sounds involved in that too
8494184 im really not happy with what you wrote the other day
8494185 well youre not as upset as youre going to be
8494186 when you say as is does that mean that you found typos that will make me look stupid
8494187 above all love each other deeply because love covers over a multitude of sins
8494188 anyone then who knows the good he ought to do and doesnt do it sins
8494189 if nine of us are arrested you must continue to rally here
8494190 its our victory that police did not storm and arrest us last night
8494191 at this moment there are more than 10 000 protesters inside
8494192 they will prepare documents and hopefully by early afternoon police will enter government house with a court injunction and arrest warrants to meet with protest leaders
8494193 the bottom line however is that the strong negative trend in summertime ice extent characterizing the past decade continues
8494194 we could have no ice at the north pole at the end of this summer and the reason here is that the north pole area right now is covered with very thin ice and this ice we call first year ice the ice that tends to melt out in the summer
8494195 its possible that ships could sail from alaska right to the north pole
8494196 clearly if you look over what we have seen in the past three years and where we were headed we are in this long term decline and we may have no ice at all in the arctic ocean in summer by 2030 or so
8494197 the schools first action in these situations is always to encourage the student to talk it through with parents
8494198 where this is not possible or the student refuses to do so and the student is deemed at serious risk the wellbeing coordinators are obliged to assist the student in seeking medical advice
8494199 school nurses do not distribute the contraceptive pill they refer students to medical practitioners
8494200 it is the general practitioner who decides what is best for the student and the course of action not the school
8494201 this means that application of the privacy regulations can at times be seen as at odds with parents
8494202 the school nurse is bound by confidentiality and i dont always get briefed on these situations
8494203 our state is better prepared than it has been before to respond to a major disaster
8494204 we have supplies pre positioned but people need to make their own plans as well now is the time to make sure you have gas in the car food and prescriptions
8494205 theres buses theres drivers theres planes theres trains theres a whole different strategy for getting people out starting with the people who have special medical needs
8494206 the big question is what shape are our levees in
8494207 were seeing too much of a one dimensional obama were not seeing the human side
8494208 if we adopt it by the next meeting the moratorium falls off
8494209 this is the first i heard of this problem its an enforcement issue i have to talk to the building inspector and see what information he has to see if there are any violations
8494210 make the opposing campaign manager throw up i dont think if they pick romney david axelrod will reach for the trash can
8494211 you think someone whos in finance merging businesses and losing american jobs is the best answer to biden
8494212 its a principle of law that a penalty should match the seriousness of the crime
8494213 the bottom line however is that the strong negative trend in summertime ice extent characterising the past decade continues
8494214 i think theres a strong argument for saying that more of the training which occurs can be done in regional and country areas where theres less population and where there are valuable job opportunities
8494215 theoretically it should be impossible for two planes to collide so theres been obviously a failure a serious failure somewhere in the system but im advised that training there has been undertaken for many many years with a good safety record
8494216 i think one of the things that we would like to see over time is more of this sort of training undertaken in less densely populated areas and i suspect thats one of the things that may come out of the reports
8494217 its one of the busiest airports in australia i think there are something like 500 000 air movements there each year its also im advised one of the safest but obviously we want to ensure that the airports are as safe as possible
8494218 investigative reasons and also because of its poor quality the fact it only shows the man from behind and because the tonal quality of the black and white footage
8494219 the existence of the footage has never been a secret with it shown to 700 people during the exhaustive investigations to identify people inside and outside the hotel that evening supt byleveld said

8494223 lets declare with one voice that barack obama is our candidate
8494224 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8494225 yall sit down we got to get along with the show here sit down please stop please sit
8494226 it is time to take back the country we love and whether you voted for me of whether you voted for barack the time is now to reunite as a single party with a single purpose
8494227 whatever is happening politically the bottom line is tomorrow morning the government is going to have to make a decision about building two power stations which are going to cost upwards of 10 billion
8494228 it doesnt have the money and it is going to come out of schools transport and other infrastructure budgets or alternatively the state will start to go into dangerous levels of debt
8494229 the business community is not only dismayed that it has happened it is confused by how it has happened because anybody who understands government finances and the energy issue thinks there was no alternative to privatisation
8494230 nsw now has a very dangerous situation where it cant invite the private sector to help fund this important infrastructure and it doesnt have the money in the forward estimates of the budget to do it itself
8494231 the defeat of the electricity sale is extremely disappointing and will have serious implications on the development of new transport infrastructure in nsw
8494232 it means that taxpayers money will stay tied up in obsolete coal fired power generators instead of being re invested in critical capacity building urban transport projects such as the m4 east and the proposed metro rail system
8494233 we would urge the liberal party to certainly reconsider supporting the sale this should be seen as bigger than politics
8494234 this is in the states long term interest and it shouldnt be viewed as a short term issue

8494285 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

8494326 the sec has been working on issues relating to ifrs adoption for several years
8494327 todays roadmap shows their continued commitment to a robust debate on adoption of ifrs for public reporting purpose they did a very good job of outlining their goals the barriers they see and how those barriers can be removed
8494328 the caq applauds the sec for its thoughtful approach to identifying the appropriate path and a reasonable timeline for u s adoption of a uniform set of high quality global accounting standards
8494329 we realize significant work lies ahead in preparing for a transition but believe ifrs has proven to be a reputable set of standards for preparing transparent financial information
8494330 fei supports the secs decision today to propose a roadmap for u s issuers for filings of financial statements prepared in accordance with ifrs

8494385 by 2020 we might have nine billion people on the planet we could have a very big middle class driving millions more cars and we could be in a really resource hungry world with the oil price climbing and a supply situation in libya russia and saudi where natural gas is limited
8494386 it is those drivers those conditions which will encourage the possibility of landfill mining
8494387 once plastic is in a landfill site it pretty much sits there doing nothing and the beauty of that is that youre able to go back and recapture it in the future
8494388 there are some really buoyant prices around because plastic is all manufactured from oil so as the raw price of oil goes up every commodity derived from it goes up accordingly
8494389 over a period of a very long time many decades we have had a policy of burying whatever we can in landfill sites so there are valuable resources in those sites
8494390 and wherever there are valuable resources there is always the temptation to investigate whether its worth recovering them the logic is sound but the practicalities are complex and you have to balance those out with the commercial viability

8494504 we have paid a very high price for this understanding among western partners but we also believe this price will be rewarded
8494505 i think maybe europe made an honest mistake and miscalculated the danger posed by russia to europe and to the free world

8494507 georgia will never forgive russia for what they have done
8494508 now hes a symbol of anti russia resistance in the post soviet space he defended the interests of his small country
8494509 eventually russia will be forced to leave and those states will be a part of sovereign georgia
8494510 once georgia is a part of europe that will happen
8494511 georgia is a country which does not fit the russian vision of a good neighbor and so this is a lesson also for ukraine

8494563 they changed the way that constable painted landscapes and they were the things that turner most admired for a century the agitation to preserve great works of art in british collections from export has been animated by anxiety that titians great paintings diana amp actaeon and diana amp callisto might be sold now the paintings have been offered on remarkably advantageous terms their acquisition by both institutions would be an historic event
8494564 the national gallery was founded when this country was in a very bad way and most of its major acquisitions have been made against and because of a background of economic distress
8494565 over the years the bridgewater collection has grown in value to the point where it is prudent to review the holding in terms of the balance of the familys overall assets
8494566 the duke would very much want these pictures the titians to continue to be accessible to public view and to achieve this is prepared to dispose of them at a price below market value and on other terms favourable to the nation he would also wish for the rest of the coll ection to remain on public display

8494568 when you start pointing to the dugout and saying all the things that he was saying a guy that respects the game like i myself i didnt appreciate it and i had to let him know
8494569 i guess he did us a favor he woke up a sleeping giant
8494570 theres days were not good enough but we really try
8494571 i was caught up in the heat of the moment got excited a little bit and they took offense to it

8494573 i may have looked over there but i didnt look at anybody in particular
8494574 we had some tempers flare and it probably helped us it probably woke us up a little bit
8494575 sometimes it takes something like that to really get the juices flowing
8494576 you dont have to do stupid things like that to disrespect this game
8494577 like i said he did us a favor and we pulled through and im glad he did that

8494619 there is a broad array of efforts now underway to eliminate the worst forms of child labor
8494620 this report reveals that many governments are demonstrating the will to change childrens lives but it also makes clear that there is much more still to do to protect children around the world from exploitive child labor
8494621 while the report showed a decline in the incidence of child labor around the world there are still millions of undocumented children working under hazardous and exploitive conditions
8494622 many of these children are forced to endure horrendous hardships because their survival depends on it and their families rely on their income

8494693 what am i looking to get out of this game the same thing you look to get out of every game
8494694 you go in there and make the plays that are there for you to make you try to make as big a splash as possible
8494695 but that philly game was last year and this year is a lot different so weve just got to wait and see what happens
8494696 yeah it felt real good to have eight sacks in one game as a team
8494697 we also had like 12 penalties and i was a part of that too
8494698 on tape it actually looked worse than what it felt like during the game it looked bad
8494699 all i can say is i didnt mean to do it i didnt realize the quarterback was under me i totally wasnt thinking about him i talked to the ref and thats exactly what he said you really didnt do anything but its just the fact that the quarterback was under you it was nothing disrespectful

8494705 es el sue o de todo jugador entrar jugar y anotar goles y qu bueno porque fue por el triunfo yo siempre he estado buscando la oportunidad y la que me den siempre tratar de aprovecharla desde fuerzas b sicas estoy trabajando muy bien y vamos empujando fuerte son pocas las oportunidades que te da la vida y se deben aprovechar ya qued atr s y s lo me queda trabajar no tengo continuidad en el campeonato local entonces aprovecho jugar la concacaf
8494706 estamos en deuda con la directiva con el due o del equipo y con los aficionados
8494707 cuando recibimos el gol dejamos de hacer cosas importantes nos descompusimos y nos volvimos vulnerables estamos teniendo un mal funcionamiento colectivo perdemos el bal n con facilidad
8494708 el problema no est en la direcci n t cnica
8494709 ganamos bien el morelia fue un rival dif cil pero el 2 0 no deja dudas de que fuimos mejores

8494712 mccain knows biden well he knows how good he is as a knife fighter hell take mccain apart
8494713 means mccain would run a campaign without a core constituency of the republican party
8494714 i think there would be a walkout on lieberman at the convention hes not a republican
8494715 when you get an education that is something nobody can take from you money is only temporary but what you have in your head if you have the right kind of head stays with you
8494716 you have to admire wayne for picking a left field choice
8494717 it will be fascinating to hear from the chairman as to why he roberts is the right guy
8494718 it will be a privilege to contribute to the companys governance
8494719 it rained every day but i got the job done now i feel very confident in trying to win this event
8494720 my goal is to win and try to forget about everything else and what it all means
8494721 my leg was straight and i couldnt bend it the muscle was in spasm and i had a lot of pain
8494722 as you can see i am completely out of breath she really pushed me to the limit
8494723 i was just trying to come back to normal position where i could just stand up and regroup again and play the next point
8494724 the republicans are immediately going to steal the spotlight and probably counter any bounce that would be there
8494725 mccain could come out of the convention with a five point lead and if it sticks around through october thats hard to shake then mccain is the leader and people are wondering why obamas losing
8494726 i think it is possible that mccain people will start out at the convention drawing contrasts with obama
8494727 it was a bland choice because nobody knows who he is
8494728 youve got poor job approval for president george w bush youve got the iraq war and the economy when you take the sum of all of these issues it suggests a larger lead for obama
8494729 that division is something thats helped mccain because obama spent a bunch of money during the primary and opponents within his own party provided a lot of ammunition
8494730 he just followed nancy pelosis line before he got permission from her basically to change his rhetoric
8494731 shes one of our top candidates believe me her colleagues want her back
8494732 these inactive leases could produce nearly double the current level of domestic oil production and more than six times the estimated peak production that anwr would provide 20 years from now
8494733 i led the charge to push speaker pelosi to schedule a september vote on opening up the outer continental shelf for drilling and i am going to keep fighting to ensure congress pursues every viable solution to americas energy crisis
8494734 this should include not only opening up new areas for drilling but also investing in coal nuclear and other forms of alternative energy that can end our costly addiction to foreign oil
8494735 but im very proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all of our children
8494736 hillary told me in no uncertain terms she is going to do everything she can to elect barack obama and that makes two of us
8494737 everything i learned as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8494738 remarkable ability to inspire people to raise our hopes and rally us to high purpose he has the intelligence and curiosity every successful president needs
8494739 are these the family values the republicans are so proud of
8494740 a good man who loves our country every bit as much as we all do as a senator he has shown his independence on several issues but on the two great questions of this election how to rebuild the american dream and how to restore americas leadership in the world he still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years
8494741 actually want us to reward them for the last eight years by giving them four more
8494742 why do i have to use google to find a good tutorial for the psp
8494743 tapping the creative community the power of voter generated media
8494744 i was kind of surprised when they picked us because were one of the few centrist political blogs
8494745 i write opinion but i mostly try to be factually based
8494746 we have an impact beyond the daily papers because we can publish a lot of information that might not be accessible anywhere else
8494747 i dont know that barack obama is giving special treatment to bloggers
8494748 but theres been a recognition by the democratic party that this is a significant new information source for a huge number of people who cant be ignored
8494749 i think the whole idea of fair and balanced is baloney
8494750 newspaper reporters are frequently just as biased as any advocacy journalist and at the same time they dont provide the same kind of in depth information that we can which is why political blogs are more attractive to consumers of media
8494751 if you post something not knowing the details someone with a ph d in that subject might post with the missing data interaction is really a key ingredient here
8494752 i try to do 7 to 8 posts a day
8494753 im not sure blogging is going to be a career for me but i love politics and i love seeing how all this stuff plays out
8494754 i can do video interviews and get them up on the site almost immediately
8494755 we do everything from political analysis to humor its great
8494756 its a small slice of the market were narrowcasters really but its a total luxury to be able to talk to political junkies about the election
8494757 the democratic party recognizes there are huge constituencies out there who can be tapped via the internet
8494758 in the old days or even a year ago that video probably would have been shot by a blogger
8494759 bloggers are a significant and much needed complement to the mainstream media and i think in 2012 youre going to see many many more of them wandering around the conventions with credentials
8494760 they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need barack obama will deliver that change

8494763 as we gather here tonight our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8494764 should we trust john mccains judgment when he says there can be no timelines to draw down our troops from iraq that we must stay indefinitely
8494765 or should we listen to barack obama who says shift responsibility to the iraqis and set a time to bring our combat troops home
8494766 when i got knocked down by guys bigger than me she sent me back out and demanded that i bloody their noses so i could walk down the street the next day

8494771 its a good bridge between the neighborhood and the police force
8494772 weve been talking about community oriented policing so were taking it to the next level

8494784 hace unos d as mandamos un video donde se ve a c mo cortaban una morera en pringles al 1 100 en yerba buena la foto que ilustra esta nota fue tomada en pringles y chacho pe aloza a unos 30 metros de donde tiraron la morera
8494785 esta semana no iba a haber sesi n porque el jueves y viernes se iban a desarrollar las jornadas legislativas finalmente esa reuni n se hizo entre lunes y martes y por eso decidimos sesionar
8494786 mi intenci n era presentarlo yo porque quiero reafirmar el trabajo de la bicameral pero bueno
8494787 los empleados no tienen una recomposici n salarial desde 1995 es un reclamo justo y que apoyamos
8494788 el defensor se hizo eco de un planteo razonable que hicimos y abri un canal de charla permanente
8494789 fueron notificados y saben que haremos lo imposible por mantenerlos dentro del plantel porque todos cumplen funciones necesarias
8494790 la mayor a del presupuesto se va en sueldos y queda poco dinero para que podamos actuar en el sinn mero de denuncias que llegan por d a que adem s son de todo tipo desde desalojos hasta cuestiones menores pero importantes
8494791 el a o pasado realizamos 11 000 actuaciones estamos presentes en toda la provincia por lo que somos el verdadero sensor social
8494792 lo importante del recorrido que planteamos tiene en total 35 kil metros es que las estaciones se van a instalar en puntos estrat gicos que les permitan a los pasajeros llegar a sectores importantes como la quinta agron mica los hospitales padilla y de ni os y el microcentro
8494793 el estado actual de las v as permite una velocidad promedio de 35 a 40 kil metros por hora una velocidad ptima para cumplir con eficiencia el recorrido
8494794 una vez que esto est resuelto se decidir si lo explotar la municipalidad o si lo har una empresa privada
8494795 hay que olvidarse del famoso cintur n de hierro las v as son un medio de transporte y justamente lo m s caro del sistema ferroviario lo importante es que a eso lo tenemos ahora hay que darles utilidad
8494796 oh by the way today my daughter asked me if we could use
8494797 i want to tell you it was a sight for sore eyes
8494798 were going to have to fight with our own members
8494799 you know theres too many of our folks and weve got polls and polls that show this that are for mccain
8494800 weve got to wake up many of our own members
8494801 i sat in my chair in my living room in total disbelief
8494802 as i sat there i had to ask myself am i really seeing this in my lifetime
8494803 i would always say to the audience that i believe one day the people in this country will elect a qualified black to the presidency of the united states
8494804 what i withheld from the audience was that i never thought i would live to see it in my lifetime
8494805 i just think the party has opened up and what were starting to see is the democratic party is demonstrating that its open and that all americans are included
8494806 i am please to advise that the cabinet budget review committee has approved funding towards the cartage of water under the urban drought water program at an expected cost of 400 000 a month
8494807 now the reason for that is simply theres 2 500 school buses in queensland
8494808 to fit every school bus in queensland with a seatbelt the amount given to me is more than 1 billion
8494809 i do not support the actions of what i believe to be a failed administration
8494810 i no longer desire to return to a position where ill be forced to serve as a scapegoat for the inappropriate affairs and activities of others
8494811 fuck to make is worse this red sox family of cunts that were sitting in front of me were really burning my ass
8494812 a winner never quits and a quiter never wins is a bit misleading actually winners know when to quit and losers dont know when to quit
8494813 there is one story in particular i find gut wrenching about a church somewhere in germany besides a railroad line where the gathered worshippers on sundays to their shame sang hymns loudly to drown out the screams of jews in the cattle cars being trundled off to their deaths
8494814 a narcissism that leads you to believe you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
8494815 it isnt very good but lots of our other artists are even worse
8494816 we were able to meet the requirements at the end of last year eight years prior to the mandate thats why when the governor came in and proposed doubling the standard we were supportive
8494817 renewable energy has become the cornerstone of each major political partys agenda
8494818 there are a lot of republican landowners in the mountains who recognize that if there is too much environmental damage people will stop visiting and the economy will be hurt
8494819 i think renewables have been popular but im not sure of where it ranks for voters when they cast their ballot
8494820 okay fine but bean fields have been known to disappear when little people sleep life is just so incredible right now i cant quite explain it i think this little snap shot from our most recent grocery shop will provide sufficient illustration
8494821 i just needed to do some more peeps mom thats all
8494822 and were thankful for all all all all of our blessings
8494823 hemos informado al se or embajador de manera formal que la junta central electoral se apresta a abrir una oficina en la hermana rep blica de hait para nosotros registrar y documentar a los ciudadanos dominicanos que residen en esa parte de la isla

8494825 la playa ha sufrido una agresi n manifiesta ya que las aportaciones de arena que se han efectuado no se corresponden con las muestras que en su d a nos dio el jefe provincial de costas vicente mart nez
8494826 por qu han tirado tierra de obra o albero en la playa
8494827 desde la asociaci n de vecinos playa blanca lanzamos p blicamente una petici n a costas y el ayuntamiento para mantener una reuni n conjunta en el mes de septiembre que sirva para analizar la situaci n y arreglar de una vez por todas la playa de la albufereta
8494828 quede en ptimas condiciones el pr ximo verano con la finalizaci n de las obras y la regeneraci n adecuada de las playas de la zona incluida la almadraba
8494829 se podr a aprovechar ese encuentro y estar nosotros presentes
8494830 los ba istas no pueden clavar su sombrilla porque en vez de arena hay tierra y piedra apelmazada
8494831 durante el mes de agosto el instituto de ecolog a litoral ha realizado diversos an lisis de la arena depositada en la albufereta y han determinado que es apta para la regeneraci n

8494854 we were thinking sav saville probably wouldnt come having just got home from beijing
8494855 we thought they might fly him in for saturdays game at pasadena but apparently he is going to be here
8494856 balls and schensch are probably a little underdone to start them together
8494857 plus i want to have a look at a smaller line up and i think jacob holmes and balls are probably a better match up for dusty and cameron tragardh
8494858 we couldnt be any happier with what hes brought to the table
8494859 we knew he had great athleticism but we didnt realise quite how athletic he is
8494860 i want to see how he goes defending kavossy franklin and mat campbell he also should know lindsay tait pretty well
8494861 i talk about house races because that is my interest that is my main focus that is my responsibility
8494862 we only have 8 incumbents that have opposition and most of those are not really competitive
8494863 im very comfortable that by getting people at a national level to pay attention to this race when it tightens down in the end well be able to get some support nationwide that will really help us
8494864 the vehicle was going to pick up prisoners and as it reached a bridge an explosive laden car exploded and nine of our policemen and two passers by were killed
8494865 mi gol va a llegar en cualquier momento debo estar tranquilo s que no convert hasta ahora pero estoy trabajando bien en funci n del equipo y con eso me basta
8494866 ellos cuentan con un plantel de jugadores con bastante altura y sacan provecho de ello en las jugadas de pelota parada entonces ser vital para nosotros el saber cuidarnos de no cometer infracciones cerca de nuestra rea y al mismo tiempo aprovechar nuestra contextura f sica y velocidad para sacar ventajas si jugamos al ras del piso como nos pidi rold n haremos un buen partido
8494867 lo importante es sumar no importa c mo no enfrentamos a un rival dif cil y respetamos eso aunque tambi n s que ellos sienten los por nosotros
8494868 los p caros y los amigos de los polic as pasan por la banquina
8494869 creo que los funcionarios de alto rango no circulan por la ruta 38 y cuando lo hacen est n protegidos pero los dem s sufrimos problemas he tenido que clavar los frenos m s de una vez por una fila de autos parados antes de una curva
8494870 quiero recoger lo positivo y lo negativo prolijamente porque si no parece que uno siempre est en contra y no es as
8494871 por esa v a transitan desde peatones hasta camiones cargados pasando por las rastras ca eras y los autos de todo tipo y calidad a veces en muy malas condiciones
8494872 pero todav a falta mucho para que termine de concretarse
8494873 esto es importante pero cuando terminen deber an dejarla pintada con las se ales que corresponde y no hacer lo que ocurri en otra oportunidad que pintaron una sola raya amarilla
8494874 un problema serio de educaci n vial tema que no se encara principalmente desde el estado aunque se pasan avisos en la televisi n no se hace ni el 1 de lo que se deber a hacer la educaci n vial tiene que efectuarse en las rutas y estar dirigida a la gente que circula por esas v as en esto tiene que entrar a jugar un esfuerzo grande de todas las instituciones que tienen que ver con la circulaci n y el tr nsito
8494875 en una ruta que tiene muchas curvas un tr nsito intenso y con lo alocados que van algunos conductores uno se encuentra de repente con una fila de veh culos parados hay que frenar de golpe y esto es un riesgo ya hubo un caso de un accidente con muertos a causa de este sistema de hacer el control que es irracional
8494876 pero los p caros y los amigos de la polic a pasan por la banquina yo lo he visto muchas veces estando parado en la ruta a la espera del control
8494877 tendr a que ser al rev s los veh culos deber an ser parados en la banquina entonces no se interrumpe la circulaci n y los p caros no se pueden escapar no han puesto racionalidad en el sistema de control
8494878 si a uno lo paran por lo menos que le expliquen lo que est haciendo mal que lo obliguen a prender las luces o a ponerse el cintur n de seguridad
8494879 en esta ruta tan peligrosa el tema de las luces es clave he visto circular veh culos sin luces tanto de d a como de noche hasta me encontr con bicicletas que van por el pavimento sin ninguna luz ni se al

8494889 love is always patient and kind love is never jealous love is not boastful or conceited it is never rude and never seeks its own advantage it does not take offence or store up grievances love does not rejoice at wrongdoing but finds its joy in the truth it is always ready to make allowances to trust to hope and to endure whatever comes love never comes to an end

8494899 within 15 minutes alexandra waltzes in she sees them and lunges across the partition to get in between them
8494900 she greets ben with the big hug and kiss this was clearly making vanessa very uncomfortable she would walk away and come back it was like two junior high school girls vying for his attention this was clearly a case of sibling rivalry
8494901 i made a movie in boston and i got to go into a lot of folks homes in the neighborhoods where i grew up
8494902 i was surprised to see how many people had to choose between buying food or paying for health care or housing
8494903 we have tremendous resources in this country its a matter of allocating them
8494904 this speech will give him the opportunity to reach the biggest audience hes ever had
8494905 the hope is that after watching this speech people will know a little bit more about who barack obama is where he comes from and where he wants to take this country
8494906 he has great soaring rhetoric but as the substance has come out his numbers have started coming down
8494907 the media is setting lofty expectations but the reality is that obama has some hard work to do in explaining what he wants to accomplish
8494908 i dont think you can duplicate that kind of moment
8494909 kennedy at 43 proved that age matters in the white house
8494910 his energy appeal to other young world leaders calm under pressure and openness to new thinking well served our nation
8494911 it was much like barack obama has done in many of his speeches and what i think hes going to do in denver
8494912 obama even though hes accomplished so much and arrived at this extraordinary position still has people out there who are not persuaded

8494951 as ive been saying for years the library is becoming less relevant and no amount of hand wringing over what we can do to get people to use the library more is going to change that but librarians are more relevant than ever if only we can disengage ourselves from privileging our buildings and collections the way that we do and utilizing our individual skills in more effective and relevant ways

8495079 dont let your great big head make promises your little bitty head cant keep
8495080 for me the hardest part about touring is leaving my family
8495081 at my age now you know my kids are such an important part of my life and to leave is difficult once im on stage im good but you know i wont lie to you i mope a lot on the road you know so for me its like keeping busy if i can be working on another book if i can be writing an album i think one of the main reasons i try to stay so busy is because im not with them its pretty difficult
8495082 so lets put em all together and put it out in front of tens of thousands of people around the country thats something to be proud of its important for us that rock continues
8495083 theres always people saying that rock is dead rock is over people are always out to kill rock n roll were the ugly stepchild of the music business and yet were the one brand of music that continues to be viable and valuable we want to go out there and stand up for rock like we have been our whole career
8495084 anybody ive played it for has gone wow motleys back
8495085 the album is loosely based on the dirt each song is like a mini story and you can plug into the book i wanted to hear a lot of guitars and snotty lyrics i didnt want loops and samples i dont want to be nine inch nails or jay z or rage against the machine or gwen stefani i dont want to be over thought or over processed me and mick mars just wanted to sound like expletive motley crue
8495086 to give you an example one time we were working up a song and i forget what it was i think it was saturday night by elton john and we were thinking about you know banging the song out live or something for a show and we just looked at each other and were like it just sounds like motley crue we couldnt make it sound like elton john motley crue has such a definitive sound that when the four of us wrap our fangs around something it just sounds like motley crue
8495087 if we were trying to appease radio appease the video channels appease the press we probably would have made a different kind of a record because lets face it a raw dirty heavy motley crue record in 2008 is you know not whats in but maybe thats why itll work
8495088 and it was a break in motley crue and it was an opportunity to finish the book which was diaries and then to write a soundtrack to a book and accidentally put together a band which is cool because sixx a m is now on the crue fest tour i get to hold double duty and its a completely different kind of thing and im hoping that people really enjoy that
8495089 were not even supposed to be alive first of all
8495090 theres really nothing to prove for us weve done just about everything we can do except for you know get into the rock and roll hall of fame and a few other things that probably in the end dont really make a difference anyway i mean musically weve made so many diverse kinds of records and weve put on such different types of shows live and you know i guess now its just about seeing how long we can survive
8495091 i know a lot of bands from the 80s that sold a heck of a lot more records than we ever did many times more but they dont seem to have the staying power or the sort of lasting impact that we have

8495107 with people who have a lot of gifts its hard for people to identify with them
8495108 barack obama is handsome hes incredibly bright hes incredibly well spoken and hes incredibly successful not exactly the easiest guy in the world to identify with
8495109 there are so many things about our candidate that are different that the challenge that we have is to give people a confidence that despite all these things that feel different okay i get what hes about personally that his family is like every other family that your kids go to school with
8495110 people need to know that the president is awake gets it isnt in some cocoon or bubble somewhere
8495111 as close to street level as possible really identify with these people

8495118 in selecting senator joe biden as his running mate senator obama has chosen a proven and effective advocate for fairness and equality that our entire community can be proud of
8495119 senator bidens record in the united states senate is one of support and understanding that has been unwavering throughout his career
8495120 we only need to look back to the recent passage of the repeal of the hiv travel and immigration ban to see the type of leadership we can expect from senator biden on the issues important to our community
8495121 it was because of his determination and tenacity that we were able to see this relic of discrimination against people living with hiv aids torn down
8495122 if the support senator biden has proven on our issues is any indication of the type of vice president he will be than our community can be assured that senator obama has chosen a thoughtful and staunch advocate for equality as his closest adviser

8495130 so thou o son of man i have set thee a watchman unto the house of israel therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth and warn them from me
8495131 kjv i must affirm my belief in the gifts of the holy spirit that is shown in the bible in the new testament
8495132 my assignment from the lord is to repent on behalf of the leadership of the charismatic body of christ
8495133 my assignment from the lord is to repent on behalf of the leadership of the charismatic body of christ we have failed the lord and his people in many ways we must repent if we are to be trusted in the future we the leaders of the charismatic community have operated in an extremely low level of discernment frankly we often dont even try to discern we assume a persons credibility based on gifts charisma whether they can prophesy or work a miracle
8495134 for god hath not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our lord jesus christ 10 who died for us that whether we wake or sleep we should live together with him 11 wherefore comfort yourselves together and edify one another even as also ye do 12 and we beseech you brethren to know them which labour among you and are over you in the lord and admonish you 13 and to esteem them very highly in love for their works sake and be at peace among yourselves
8495135 and i say also unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it 19 and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven
8495136 the watchman of ephraim was with my god but the prophet is a snare of a fowler in all his ways and hatred in the house of his god 9 they have deeply corrupted themselves as in the days of gibeah therefore he will remember their iniquity he will visit their sins
8495137 gustav will be a sign to america and to the nations as it is the 7th hurricane and there are many more devastating hurricanes to come behind this one as gustav develops it will be a sign of the striking blow to america for the lord god is about to strike america with his staff his power and authority beyond anything america has ever seen
8495138 i will cause america and the church of america to make them see my mighty arm of judgments
8495139 and one said unto him lord are they few that are saved and he said unto them 24 strive to enter in by the narrow door for many i say unto you shall seek to enter in and shall not be able 25 when once the master of the house is risen up and hath shut to the door and ye begin to stand without and to knock at the door saying lord open to us and he shall answer and say to you i know you not whence ye are 26 then shall ye begin to say we did eat and drink in thy presence and thou didst teach in our streets 27 and he shall say i tell you i know not whence ye are depart from me all ye workers of iniquity 28 there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth when ye shall see abraham and isaac and jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of god and yourselves cast forth without 29 and they shall come from the east and west and from the north and south and shall sit down in the kingdom of god 30 and behold there are last who shall be first and there are first who shall be last
8495140 strive to enter in at the strait gate for many i say unto you will seek to enter in and shall not be able
8495141 enter ye in at the strait gate for wide is the gate abroad is the way that leadeth to destruction and many there be which go in thereat 14 because strait is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life and few there be that find it
8495142 and if the righteous scarcely be saved where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear
8495143 to give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death to guide our feet into the way of peace
8495144 let them alone they be blind leaders of the blind and if the blind lead the blind both shall fall into the ditch
8495145 if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not have the truth
8495146 fear not little flock for it is your fathers good pleasure to give you the kingdom
8495147 and he said unto him thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind 38 this is the great and first commandment 39 and a second like unto it is this thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself 40 on these two commandments the whole law hangeth and the prophets
8495148 jesus saith unto him i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me
8495149 and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free
8495150 if i speak with the tongues of men and of angels but have not love i am become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal 2 and if i have the gift of prophecy and know all mysteries and all knowledge and if i have all faith so as to remove mountains but have not love i am nothing 3 and if i bestow all my goods to feed the poor and if i give my body to be burned but have not love it profiteth me nothing 4 love suffereth long and is kind love envieth not love vaunteth not itself is not puffed up 5 doth not behave itself unseemly seeketh not its own is not provoked taketh not account of evil 6 rejoiceth not in unrighteousness but rejoiceth with the truth 7 beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things 8 love never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall be done away whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall be done away
8495151 whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be sanctified if a garment be sprinkled with the blood thereof it shall be washed in a holy place
8495152 nowhere in the old testament do we find any clear indication of a third person
8495153 the jews never regarded the spirit as a person nor is there any solid evidence that any old testament writer held this view the holy spirit is usually presented in the synoptics gospels and in acts as a divine force or power
8495154 the o ld t estament clearly does not envisage gods spirit as a person gods spirit is simply gods power if it is sometimes represented as being distinct from god it is because the breath of yahweh acts exteriorly
8495155 the majority of n ew t estament texts reveal gods spirit as something not someone this is especially seen in the parallelism between the spirit and the power of god
8495156 on the whole the new testament like the old speaks of the spirit as a divine energy or power
8495157 and behold the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom and the earth did quake and the rocks were rent
8495158 draw nigh to god and he will draw nigh to you cleanse your hands ye sinners and purify your hearts ye doubleminded
8495159 but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering kindness goodness faithfulness 23 meekness self control against such there is no law 24 and they that are of christ jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts thereof 25 if we live by the spirit by the spirit let us also walk let us not become vainglorious provoking one another envying one another
8495160 and he said unto him thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind 38 this is the great and first commandment 39 and a second like unto it is this thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself 40 on these two commandments the whole law hangeth and the prophets
8495161 thou seest that faith wrought with his works and by works was faith made perfect
8495162 he that hath my commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and i will love him and will manifest myself unto him
8495163 but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of god dwelleth in you but if any man hath not the spirit of christ he is none of his
8495164 that i should be a minister of christ jesus unto the gentiles ministering the gospel of god that the offering up of the gentiles might be made acceptable being sanctified by the holy spirit
8495165 he that loveth not knoweth not god for god is love 9 herein was the love of god manifested in us that god hath sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him 10 herein is love not that we loved god but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins 11 beloved if god so loved us we also ought to love one another 12 no man hath beheld god at any time if we love one another god abideth in us and his love is perfected in us 13 hereby we know that we abide in him and he in us because he hath given us of his spirit

8495184 its truly distinguished its like having a 24 letter password you know nobodys going to crack that
8495185 it really started to accelerate when the terrors broke up and i still wanted to play shows
8495186 we did the basic tracks for the album over a year ago and shane had cut the tracks and then he up and moved
8495187 i called david because ive been playing with him since seventh grade the first thing we did was the seventh grade talent show
8495188 weve played in ska bands punk bands crazy rock bands
8495189 its just another one of those things that doesnt make any sense just a bunch of ideas that flow into each other
8495190 its to the point where we spent so much time on that album that were already halfway through the next two albums
8495191 the next album is almost finished we dont even play a lot of the songs on the first album live anymore
8495192 its so weird when people ask us what kind of music we play were like uh maybe folk but as soon as you say it no thats not it
8495193 all proceeds go to the hospital for equipment or wherever the need is greatest so it benefits the community overall
8495194 it will be hosted by media personalities orla johannes and mark shaloub and many of our 23 volunteer models are well known on the west island including pierrefonds roxboro borough mayor monique worth hudson mayor elizabeth corker and baie durf mayor maria tutino

8495197 all models are staff of friends of the residence six of the male models are employees of the cibc which has been a big supporter the boutique de mariage and jones new york in kirkland are among the local designers who have also lent their support from the early days
8495198 new this year is a raffle with three big prizes and guests will also have an opportunity to buy the jewellery and makeup the models will be wearing
8495199 as soon as it was evident we needed repairs the community came together to help us
8495200 if you had a renovation for a couple of thousand dollars the permit cost would be different
8495201 im looking to attract a wide spectrum there are not a lot of opportunities to get together and sing in the daytime my idea was to put together a non auditioned choir of people who enjoy singing whether or not they have experience
8495202 i also worked with the hudson music club and lakeshore light opera and have done many broadway style shows including kiss me kate guys and dolls a chorus line and the sound of music among others
8495203 proceeds from our concerts the first is tentatively set for spring 2009 will go to projects in developing countries
8495204 launching programs will be done over a period of time
8495205 anything we initiate will be voluntary we wont force anyone to take part in any programs if they dont want to
8495206 we have a whole department with extensive policies and we put a big emphasis on healthy eating and healthy choices for our elementary and high schools
8495207 we have a great working relationship with pierrefonds im sure if they want to sit down and talk we can come to an agreement
8495208 it is a major problem that many children are watching tv and are on their computers all the time
8495209 i can see kids having a good time and be eager to do physical activity it brings up their confidence level and when that happens they have fewer problems at school with bullies
8495210 its true kids are less active than they used to be they have more to keep them occupied and you have to push them more into activities
8495211 but a lot of kids are still active our sports camp is as big as ever
8495212 i havent noticed a difference size wise but activity wise yes
8495213 its a combination of things why kids are less active everyone tries to pack so much in one day and people forget the important things like health
8495214 this is crazy are these people for real it is so hard to comprehend that this brat is running for potus and dems are buying into him i just cannot get it thru my head at all i used to say it about the 28 of die hard shrubs but never thought i would see it in my fellow dems
8495215 as far as im concerned youre just another picture to burn

8495225 and jehovah spake unto moses saying 2 command the children of israel and say unto them when ye come into the land of canaan this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance even the land of canaan according to the borders thereof 3 then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of zin along by the side of edom and your south border shall be from the end of the salt sea eastward 4 and your border shall turn about southward of the ascent of akrabbim and pass along to zin and the goings out thereof shall be southward of kadesh barnea and it shall go forth to hazar addar and pass along to azmon 5 and the border shall turn about from azmon unto the brook of egypt and the goings out thereof shall be at the sea 6 and for the western border ye shall have the great sea and the border thereof this shall be your west border 7 and this shall be your north border from the great sea ye shall mark out for you mount hor 8 from mount hor ye shall mark out unto the entrance of hamath and the goings out of the border shall be at zedad 9 and the border shall go forth to ziphron and the goings out thereof shall be at hazar enan this shall be your north border 10 and ye shall mark out your east border from hazar enan to shepham 11 and the border shall go down from shepham to riblah on the east side of ain and the border shall go down and shall reach unto the side of the sea of chinnereth eastward 12 and the border shall go down to the jordan and the goings out thereof shall be at the salt sea this shall be your land according to the borders thereof round about 13 and moses commanded the children of israel saying this is the land which ye shall inherit by lot which jehovah hath commanded to give unto the nine tribes and to the half tribe 14 for the tribe of the children of reuben according to their fathers houses and the tribe of the children of gad according to their fathers houses have received and the half tribe of manasseh have received their inheritance 15 the two tribes and the half tribe have received their inheritance beyond the jordan at jericho eastward toward the sunrising 16 and jehovah spake unto moses saying 17 these are the names of the men that shall divide the land unto you for inheritance eleazar the priest and joshua the son of nun 18 and ye shall take one prince of every tribe to divide the land for inheritance 19 and these are the names of the men of the tribe of judah caleb the son of jephunneh 20 and of the tribe of the children of simeon shemuel the son of ammihud 21 of the tribe of benjamin elidad the son of chislon 22 and of the tribe of the children of dan a prince bukki the son of jogli 23 of the children of joseph of the tribe of the children of manasseh a prince hanniel the son of ephod 24 and of the tribe of the children of ephraim a prince kemuel the son of shiphtan 25 and of the tribe of the children of zebulun a prince elizaphan the son of parnach 26 and of the tribe of the children of issachar a prince paltiel the son of azzan 27 and of the tribe of the children of asher a prince ahihud the son of shelomi 28 and of the tribe of the children of naphtali a prince pedahel the son of ammihud 29 these are they whom jehovah commanded to divide the inheritance unto the children of israel in the land of canaan
8495226 in those days they shall say no more the fathers have eaten sour grapes and the childrens teeth are set on edge 30 but every one shall die for his own iniquity every man that eateth the sour grapes his teeth shall be set on edge 31 behold the days come saith jehovah that i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah 32 not according to the covenant that i made with their fathers in the day that i took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of egypt which my covenant they brake although i was a husband unto them saith jehovah 33 but this is the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days saith jehovah i will put my law in their inward parts and in their heart will i write it and i will be their god and they shall be my people 34 and they shall teach no more every man his neighbor and every man his brother saying know jehovah for they shall all know me from the least of them unto the greatest of them saith jehovah for i will forgive their iniquity and their sin will i remember no more
8495227 in that day jehovah made a covenant with abram saying unto thy seed have i given this land from the river of egypt unto the great river the river euphrates
8495228 and jehovah said unto me arise take thy journey before the people and they shall go in and possess the land which i sware unto their fathers to give unto them
8495229 by faith abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whither he went 9 by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in tabernacles with isaac and jacob the heirs with him of the same promise
8495230 thou shalt not remove thy neighbors landmark which they of old time have set in thine inheritance which thou shalt inherit in the land that jehovah thy god giveth thee to possess it
8495231 why seeing times are not hidden from the almighty do they that know him not see his days 2 some remove the landmarks they violently take away flocks and feed thereof
8495232 remove not the ancient landmark which thy fathers have set
8495233 remove not the old landmark and enter not into the fields of the fatherless

8495240 i spun and was going forward and a guy hit me from the side and then he came straight down on my ankle
8495241 i remember hap saying he saw from the sideline the inside of my ankle touch the ground he thought it was an ankle or a knee i guess luckily my ankle gave away first
8495242 i knew something was wrong but i didnt know it was that bad i walked off the field and he took everything off it wasnt swollen yet it just looked normal hap taped it up put the ankle brace on and i was running up and down the sidelines trying to get back in he asked if i was ready and i told him it felt like i was walking on a sponge he cut off the tape took me back to x rays and saw i was going to need surgery
8495243 i felt like i disappointed the football team and duke because i only played one full season
8495244 i had to sit out the first year and then i got hurt last year i did not want to leave duke with three games my last year
8495245 they put together a whole packet and sent it in
8495246 i wanted to do a masters program or try to get into grad school but at the time i found out that i would get the sixth year it was too late because all the deadlines had passed
8495247 so my academic advisors told me to declare another major i will be finished with my second major in december
8495248 i was talking to some guys on the team and we noticed right away that you can tell somethings different
8495249 coach cutcliffe knows what hes doing hes a smart man and he knows football
8495250 after surgery i went down a lot in weight and then i thought i couldnt put it back on
8495251 then it all came back at one time and i had to start dieting again
8495252 they told me it was going to hurt and that there was no way around it especially with the nature of the injury and it being a weight bearing joint
8495253 i would come in ever day spending two or three hours rehabbing it and icing it
8495254 he rehabbed with kerry mullenix our director of athletic rehabilitation
8495255 he was diligent and did everything he had to do and worked real hard at it and was committed he had a good recovery and he is doing fine now
8495256 he has worked back to get healthy and strong and tielor is a great asset to this football team
8495257 to see him back healthy is a good thing for this football team
8495258 he is probably in the best shape that he has ever been in which is going to help him as far as his injuries
8495259 coach middleton said before the summer started that he wanted me to get down to around 230 so i would be quicker in and out of my cuts
8495260 im at 230 4 right now and i got my body fat down 4 percentages points i was 240 pounds last year
8495261 his intensity and effort on the field is one to be admired and one our team can follow
8495262 he goes hard every play and he brings the wood behind everything he throws at the defense his engine is nonstop
8495263 he is going to have a chance to play football beyond college he is a huge asset to this team

8495267 this attempt to restrict the operation of catering trucks is a pretext for creating a
8495268 hes one of our main guys but we dont think its a season ending injury
8495269 the time frame it fluctuates but hopefully with his youth and hes been pretty durable and resilient to injury hopefully he does get back soon
8495270 with the offseason moves we made hopefully we can still play at a high level this year to me its more something that you look at as a challenge and you dont let it defeat you you deal with it
8495271 training camp was going to be an important part of his development
8495272 thats going to be postponed obviously but hes got a lot of development on and off the court that hes going to continue to do ive got a lot of confidence in him and now his job is to get healthy
8495273 just in talking to nellie today were talking about maybe spreading that ball around and getting scoring from different areas

8495281 i will leave it to others to decide the inspiration factor
8495282 i heard about it on one of the local news stations on my commute in that they were offering the chance to drive these
8495283 youre not sacrificing anything and actually for me its an enhanced driving experience
8495284 i think thats a misconception people have that youre puttering around in an underpowered cramped little soapbox
8495285 in preseason they have to play and get ready to go but you kind of hold your breath all the time
8495286 last week there were some really good players that got hurt around the league and you just hope it doesnt happen to you
8495287 it worked out pretty well that way to be sure
8495288 i mean i dont like training camp i dont know anyone who does
8495289 it helps that my wife is a registered dietitian and a physical therapist shes a big reason ive been able to play as long as i have and the big reason i feel as good as i do
8495290 he missed all of training camp but he reminded me hes practiced as much as chris spencer the starting center who just returned to practice after being out with a sore back
8495291 hes a funny guy its good to have him back hes a good snapper
8495292 hes a young man and hes got a back like mine its not good

8495302 but i dont approve of breaking wind how can i be responsible for organising the annual competition
8495303 you cant go placing something so important as the annual winter farting contest in the paws of a child

8495391 el divorcio deber concederse con la simple alegaci n de no querer seguir casado porque esto demuestra que ya no existe voluntad deber darse cuando se alegue no querer continuar con el matrimonio debi ndose acreditar y adjuntar un convenio
8495392 la convivencia puede ser insostenible pero eso no nos da derecho a que eliminemos de un golpe y de un solo plumazo las causales que est n establecidas para protecci n de una de las dos partes
8495393 estoy de acuerdo en suprimir las causales pero no lo estoy en que el divorcio se decrete por la autoridad judicial con la sola manifestaci n de voluntad de uno de los c nyuges privando al otro consorte la posibilidad de manifestarse en contra
8495394 you catch wild pigs by finding a suitable place in the woods and putting corn on the ground the pigs find it and begin to come every day to eat the free corn when they are used to coming every day you put a fence down one side of the place where they are used to coming
8495395 when they get used to the fence they begin to eat the corn again and you put up another side of the fence
8495396 suddenly the wild pigs have lost their freedom they run around and around inside the fence but they are caught soon they go back to eating the free corn they are so used to it that they have forgotten how to forage in the woods for themselves so they accept their captivity

8495417 youre just petty politicians whod sooner sign onto the wisdom of a tyrant in another country than the demands of ticked off voters in your own
8495418 the point i made and ill make it again is that al qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will thats their fundamental underlying strategy that if they can kill enough americans or cause enough havoc create enough chaos in iraq then well quit and go home and my statement was that if we adopt the pelosi policy that then we will validate the strategy of al qaeda i said it and i meant it
8495419 a political party cannot be all things to all people it must represent certain fundamental beliefs which must not be compromised to political expediency or simply to swell its numbers

8495422 the difference between a good team and a great team
8495423 is being content and getting a win today and coming out flat tomorrow or coming out tomorrow and really trying to do everything we can to get that victory the great teams come out and find a way to send a message and win that game tomorrow
8495424 it is difficult to separate del martin and phyllis lyon and write about only one of them their lives and their work have intertwined and their enduring dedication to social justice has been recognized many times
8495425 the alarming part of this report is the acceleration of inflation in the past 3 months while the unadjusted rate for the past 12 months was 6 2 the 3 month annualized rate of increase was 11 9
8495426 on a seasonally adjusted basis the cpi u advanced 0 8 percent in july following a 1 1 percent increase in june
8495427 about half of the overall increase in the all items index
8495428 the food index rose 0 9 percent in july after rising 0 8 percent in june indexes for five of the six major grocery store food groups rose at least 1 0 percent

8495441 i profoundly disagree with the direction that john wants to take the country
8495442 ive been on the ground in georgia iraq pakistan and afghanistan and i can tell you in no uncertain terms this administrations policy has been an abject failure
8495443 again and again on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8495444 and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8495445 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8495446 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8495447 after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home
8495448 be there because barack obama and joe biden will deliver america the change we so desperately need
8495449 joe biden is right we need more than a good soldier we need a leader with the experience and judgment to serve as commander in chief from day one that leader is john mccain
8495450 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8495451 police will use a softened stance to deal with the protesters
8495452 we will give them time to leave the government house but if they continue to defy the court order then we have to use force to drive them out i cannot set the precise time or deadline for this
8495453 if we get arrested please dont follow us to the detention center
8495454 if the police want to arrest them come here and do so or if they want our leaders to give themselves up that is fine but the government has to resign first

8495482 our position in the world has been weakened by too much unilateralism and too little cooperation
8495483 in some way the mccain people would love to see this as a repeat of reagan versus carter in 1980 where reagan got to run as the candidate of america and carter was the candidate of complexity and no answers

8495503 weve got a sour taste in our mouth from last week a 13 0 loss to new orleans in terms of some of the issues we had so were looking to execute a little bit better and start off right against baltimore on sept 7
8495504 i dont know ive always played the position of quarterback and ive always been real comfortable back there its just a matter of being comfortable with your surroundings and the offense and who youre with ive gained a good sense of that since ive been here
8495505 i guess its not as competitive as detroits jon kitnas i saw him and kitna in pregame throwing balls at the goal posts i think me being younger than him probably has something to do with how different our relationship is but theres a good amount of trust between us now just in terms of stuff that im seeing while hes on the field and us being able to talk about different plays and coverages he trusts what im saying to him
8495506 the biggest difference is where we came from hes been the star all his life the heisman winner and all that and i went to harvard hes always been in the limelight and ive kind of always been in the shadows at the same time the trust weve established with each other in terms of our football smarts and instincts is going to go a long way this year

8495514 its true kids are less active than they used to be they have more to keep them occupied and you have to push them more into activities
8495515 but a lot of kids are still active our sports camp is as big as ever
8495516 i havent noticed a difference size wise but activity wise yes
8495517 its a combination of things why kids are less active everyone tries to pack so much in one day and people forget the important things like health

8495605 nsw now has a very dangerous situation where it cant invite the private sector to help fund this important infrastructure and it doesnt have the money in the forward estimates of the budget to do it itself
8495606 the defeat of the electricity sale is extremely disappointing and will have serious implications on the development of new transport infrastructure in nsw
8495607 it means that taxpayers money will stay tied up in obsolete coal fired power generators instead of being re invested in critical capacity building urban transport projects such as the m4 east and the proposed metro rail system
8495608 we would urge the liberal party to certainly reconsider supporting the sale this should be seen as bigger than politics
8495609 this is in the states long term interest and it shouldnt be viewed as a short term issue
8495610 this was one way to provide the money to have reinvested in the states grid to provide certainty of supply
8495611 i think theres a strong argument for saying that more of the training which occurs can be done in regional and country areas where theres less population and where there are valuable job opportunities
8495612 theoretically it should be impossible for two planes to collide so theres been obviously a failure a serious failure somewhere in the system but im advised that training there has been undertaken for many many years with a good safety record
8495613 i think one of the things that we would like to see over time is more of this sort of training undertaken in less densely populated areas and i suspect thats one of the things that may come out of the reports
8495614 its one of the busiest airports in australia i think there are something like 500 000 air movements there each year its also im advised one of the safest but obviously we want to ensure that the airports are as safe as possible
8495615 obviously yesterday was a tragic accident and tragic for the family concerned but it could have been worse we are grateful for the fact no schools or occupied houses were affected but we will look very closely at the report of the coroner and casa
8495616 investigative reasons and also because of its poor quality the fact it only shows the man from behind and because the tonal quality of the black and white footage
8495617 the existence of the footage has never been a secret with it shown to 700 people during the exhaustive investigations to identify people inside and outside the hotel that evening supt byleveld said
8495618 police have been able to identify every one of the people in this vision except for this man
8495619 we would like this man or any person who recognises this man to come forward and contact crime stoppers on 1800 333 000 so that the special crime squad can complete this line of investigation

8495625 yall sit down we got to get along with the show here sit down please stop please sit
8495626 it is time to take back the country we love and whether you voted for me of whether you voted for barack the time is now to reunite as a single party with a single purpose
8495627 but what really incensed me was when i was told i could not change it back to lloyds is pants because they said it
8495628 i asked if it was pants they didnt like and would lloyds is rubbish do but they didnt think so
8495629 so i tried barclays is better and that didnt go down too well either
8495630 the rules seemed to change and they told me it had to be one word so i tried censorship but they didnt like that and then said it had to be no more than six letters long
8495631 but what really incensed me was when i was told i could not change it back to lloyds is pants because they said it
8495632 i asked if it was pants they didnt like and would lloyds is rubbish do but they didnt think so

8495634 the rules seemed to change and they told me it had to be one word so i tried censorship but they didnt like that and then said it had to be no more than six letters long
8495635 barack obama taking it to the hole and dunking on mccain
8495636 i am sick to death of all this remorse and rehabilitation get down to basics if you commit crime you get sentenced
8495637 if the legal profession has got this sort of person coming through the ranks god helps us in the future
8495638 the victims that prosecutors are electing to proceed with at this time said jane robison a spokeswoman for the district attorneys office
8495639 the victims that prosecutors are electing to proceed with at this time amp squo amp squo said jane robison a spokeswoman for the district attorney amp squo s office
8495640 its a principle of law that a penalty should match the seriousness of the crime
8495641 the bottom line however is that the strong negative trend in summertime ice extent characterising the past decade continues
8495642 lets declare with one voice that barack obama is our candidate
8495643 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8495644 yall sit down we got to get along with the show here sit down please stop please sit
8495645 it is time to take back the country we love and whether you voted for me of whether you voted for barack the time is now to reunite as a single party with a single purpose
8495646 i can say generically that the medical examiners decision is based on a medical point of view and not from a legal point of view
8495647 at this point im not in a position to comment
8495648 but the medical examiner doesnt necessarily know all the facts hes just giving an opinion about the immediate cause of death and not the legal cause
8495649 without knowing the case facts you can just speculate on a million different possibilities
8495650 all i can say is that he drowned i dont know how it happened that he drowned
8495651 not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
8495652 the sight of russian tanks in a neighboring country on the 40th anniversary of the crushing of the prague spring has shown that the temptations of power politics remain
8495653 the jury found that at some point the dolls infringed but the question is was it the earlier dolls or the later dolls or all of them
8495654 prudence would dictate that we leave the text as it is until our candidate catches up with us
8495655 i want to give him a platform he can run on
8495656 i dont want to stick my finger in his eye
8495657 force americans to sacrifice their way of life or trim their hopes and dreams for their children
8495658 he is the stone you builders rejected which has become the capstone
8495659 is found in no one else for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved
8495660 our voluntary efforts are only occasional and interrupted while our unconscious energy is everywhere operative and constant
8495661 our constant and silent energy is most expressive of our real character
8495662 we can be as close to god as we choose to be
8495663 once one acknowledges the revelation then everything may have to be rethought and redescribed in the light of what has been discovered
8495664 how true it is that god does not show favoritism but accepts men from every nation who fear him and do what is right
8495665 what made barnabas glad was the evidence of the free favor of god unlimited by racial or religious frontiers extended to all men without distinction
8495666 were making a concerted effort to inform our fort bragg community of the problem weve had this summer
8495667 we could very well be in that quick slide downward in terms of passing a tipping point
8495668 it also means that climate warming is also coming larger and faster than the models are predicting and nobodys really taken into account that change yet
8495669 jackson hattiesburg laurel and all areas along the coast its a little mexico
8495670 im not against people trying to make living i have a compassion for those folks but at the same time the taxpayers of mississippi shouldnt be subsidizing a plant that wont even hire their own workers
8495671 runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for its jobs it is company policy that it hires only u s citizens and legal immigrants
8495672 i dont see any evidence of remorse or concern for anyone but himself
8495673 i do feel deep remorse and would like to apologize to any customer who ever had a bad experience with my company
8495674 i apologize to all the great people the employees of berkeley theyve given their heart and soul i let them down
8495675 it probably will take some years before that is accomplished
8495676 the time i have left id like to spend with them i dont think its fair to take me away from them
8495677 all of us owe george soros a great deal of gratitude
8495678 he thinks the ballot question is a responsible initiative to reduce the overreliance on criminal justice sanctions in dealing with marijuana
8495679 marijuana should not be a priority of the criminal justice system
8495680 these upbeat capital goods numbers amid a downtrodden u s consumer sector indicates how helpful a weak dollar is in the current cycle
8495681 the recent downturn in growth abroad and stabilization of the dollar could put pressure on capital goods spending in the months ahead
8495682 exports are holding up a lot better than we thought they would with the weakness in europe and japan and we are seeing the impact of the stimulus package on business investment decisions
8495683 it was a very tough decision but it seemed like the right thing to do ultimately
8495684 i felt like i was ready for some new challenges and to try something different
8495685 we will be doing a regional search to find someone of johns caliber to lead that department
8495686 there was basically nobody living in the downtown core area
8495687 if you compare the activity level downtown now to 2000 it has increased dramatically
8495688 we have a lot of projects on the table right now we need a good person there that can analyze projects and help the mayor and city council with information
8495689 i feel im leaving winston salem better than i found it
8495690 i can go play with my brother and use my hands on the bicycle we can spin if my hands are good my brother can jump on my back we can play
8495691 i can make polka dots and rainbows with my hands and crayons
8495692 i can work and help my mom with my hands
8495693 the reasoning behind the plea agreement was there were some issues with regard to his mental health background in addition to the fact that at least one of the potential witnesses would have been the daughter
8495694 obviously we didnt want to put her and the families through the rigors of a capital trial they were willing to agree to the plea
8495695 he had gotten increasingly agitated and was less and less rational
8495696 if we had gone to trial our defense would have been a diminished capacity
8495697 he was diagnosed with anxiety disorder and paranoia that affected his ability to premeditate
8495698 the operation is over our special forces have killed third militant early today
8495699 the final assault was lunched at 1145 p m last night by the special forces of the army and entire family of the house owner including four children were rescued
8495700 the ministry of commerce is very clear no land can be forcibly acquired for sezs
8495701 whatever you do in india there are bottlenecks whether you start an sez airport or an airline anything we have absolutely no issue on that
8495702 there are ambiguities in the regulations but they are no major show stoppers
8495703 the project looks good on paper we hope to get some decent returns on it
8495704 oh clean water is by far their biggest need or education if they only had education everything would be great or actually health care is their number one need

8495834 investigative reasons and also because of its poor quality the fact it only shows the man from behind and because the tonal quality of the black and white footage

8495838 mr anderson has indicated that as a nsw wheat grower and awb a class shareholder he supports reform in light of the new wheat export marketing arrangements awb chairman brendan stewart said
8495839 without a single desk and the introduction of a competitive marketplace growers now need genuine choice from domestic exporters and i believe that it is in growers interests that the awb can be as competitive as possible mr anderson said
8495840 in these circumstances i have come to believe that it is in growers best interest to vote for reform
8495841 whatever is happening politically the bottom line is tomorrow morning the government is going to have to make a decision about building two power stations which are going to cost upwards of 10 billion
8495842 it doesnt have the money and it is going to come out of schools transport and other infrastructure budgets or alternatively the state will start to go into dangerous levels of debt
8495843 the business community is not only dismayed that it has happened it is confused by how it has happened because anybody who understands government finances and the energy issue thinks there was no alternative to privatisation
8495844 nsw now has a very dangerous situation where it cant invite the private sector to help fund this important infrastructure and it doesnt have the money in the forward estimates of the budget to do it itself
8495845 the defeat of the electricity sale is extremely disappointing and will have serious implications on the development of new transport infrastructure in nsw
8495846 it means that taxpayers money will stay tied up in obsolete coal fired power generators instead of being re invested in critical capacity building urban transport projects such as the m4 east and the proposed metro rail system
8495847 we would urge the liberal party to certainly reconsider supporting the sale this should be seen as bigger than politics
8495848 this is in the states long term interest and it shouldnt be viewed as a short term issue
8495849 this was one way to provide the money to have reinvested in the states grid to provide certainty of supply
8495850 i think theres a strong argument for saying that more of the training which occurs can be done in regional and country areas where theres less population and where there are valuable job opportunities
8495851 theoretically it should be impossible for two planes to collide so theres been obviously a failure a serious failure somewhere in the system but im advised that training there has been undertaken for many many years with a good safety record
8495852 i think one of the things that we would like to see over time is more of this sort of training undertaken in less densely populated areas and i suspect thats one of the things that may come out of the reports
8495853 its one of the busiest airports in australia i think there are something like 500 000 air movements there each year its also im advised one of the safest but obviously we want to ensure that the airports are as safe as possible
8495854 obviously yesterday was a tragic accident and tragic for the family concerned but it could have been worse we are grateful for the fact no schools or occupied houses were affected but we will look very closely at the report of the coroner and casa
8495855 were just trying to enforce the law and i thought it was an egregious situation involving huge sums of money and that it ought to be addressed
8495856 we have a situation here where they are making things a crime that are not a crime
8495857 chop chop chop heck its only my almy matey whats she ever done for me
8495858 it is my deepest conviction that what god teaches us about himself in his word is of utmost importance to my personal daily life
8495859 truly there is nothing like a good grasp of accurate knowledge about god to enable you to meet the practical demands of your life the practical demands of being a daughter mother wife sister or friend

8495864 the victims that prosecutors are electing to proceed with at this time said jane robison a spokeswoman for the district attorneys office
8495865 investigative reasons and also because of its poor quality the fact it only shows the man from behind and because the tonal quality of the black and white footage
8495866 the existence of the footage has never been a secret with it shown to 700 people during the exhaustive investigations to identify people inside and outside the hotel that evening supt byleveld said
8495867 police have been able to identify every one of the people in this vision except for this man
8495868 we would like this man or any person who recognises this man to come forward and contact crime stoppers on 1800 333 000 so that the special crime squad can complete this line of investigation

8495890 in the late 80s a bunch of skaters who were bored in the wintertime inadvertently made snowboarding what it is today
8495891 the problem afflicting some skateboarders who push off with their back foot on the skateboard instead of their front foot such skaters are known as mongo footed and feel uncomfortable or unsafe pushing with their front foot on the board as a result mongo footed skateboarders dont have as much time to prepare themselves for a trick after pushing off because they have to shuffle their feet around a lot after getting on the board
8495892 to my knowledge these results are some of the highest grade tungsten mineralisation reported anywhere in the world and give strong encouragement to the deposits potential for future development
8495893 its a principle of law that a penalty should match the seriousness of the crime
8495894 i want everybody to now understand why i am so proud to have joe biden and the whole biden family
8495895 i think hes presented himself pretty well so far what do you think
8495896 no longer will the eight most dreaded words in the be the vice presidents office is on the phone
8495897 i know it you know it barack obama gets it
8495898 this is the time as americans together we get back up
8495899 these are extraordinary times this is an extraordinary election are ready barack obama is ready this is his time this is our time this is americas time
8495900 i profoundly disagree with the direction that john wants to take the country
8495901 ive been on the ground in georgia iraq and i can tell you in no uncertain terms this administrations policy has been an abject failure
8495902 again and again on the most important of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8495903 and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8495904 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8495905 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8495906 be there because will deliver america the change we so desperately need
8495907 joe biden is right we need more than a good soldier we need a leader with the experience and judgment to serve as commander in chief from day one that leader is
8495908 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8495909 the requirement right now in iraq is much more about nation building than it is fighting
8495910 its our view that if theres a stiffer fight going on someplace else then thats where we need to be
8495911 air power is the premier asymmetric advantage that we hold over the taliban they have no like capability
8495912 well continue to drop bombs we will also continue at every effort to preserve civilian lives who unfortunately are a part of the battlefield
8495913 ustedes me han etiquetado ahora los ficho yo los declaro los no perdonados
8495914 we dont need a good soldier we need a wise leader
8495915 has intimate knowledge of it related and other business services but equally important is its knowledge of how law firms operate and grow e g its web based case management software this combination deepens its appeal to the niche it serves
8495916 we are very excited to receive this recognition from inc magazine
8495917 it is further validation that our business model and the services we provide are delivering outstanding value to our customers
8495918 there is a huge demand for these types of support services among small and mid sized firms
8495919 we derive a great deal of satisfaction from knowing we are helping our customers build and market their businesses so they can focus on what they do best working with the law ranking so highly in the inc 5000 fastest growing firms shows were doing the right things and doing them right
8495920 airline frequent flyer miles arent what they used to be fees and redemption hassles are prompting airline loyalty club members to reevaluate the value of such programs now hotel brands including wyndham and hilton are taking advantage by offering more flexibility and a varied prize pool the hotel chains offerings are beginning to look better by comparison
8495921 watching the chatter about the loyalty programs it would be hard not to say i didnt sense some dissatisfaction with the changes that are happening with the airline programs
8495922 little girls dont know how to be sweet girls momma didnt teach me
8495923 face down on top of your bed oh why did i give it up to you
8495924 i get one line into one of their songs and i have to stop and write my own

8495926 i told them i can retire now from international ball but lebron james threw out something i didnt like he said he wont play in 2012 unless im there
8495927 j kidd is going to become a player coach now
8495928 i would love to get with those young guys and help them win because i know they are right at the next step of getting to the super bowl
8495929 i would love to be a part of clevelands organization and help them get to that next level
8495930 ricky manning may be on the browns free agent radar
8495931 only time will tell with that one there are a lot of things that go into it what we think about the guys we have and things like that sometimes finances get involved so you just take each situation differently and day by day and see

8495935 i know who len pasquarelli is but who is matt williamson and why do i care he is being mentioned in this blog
8495936 i think theres a strong argument for saying that more of the training which occurs can be done in regional and country areas where theres less population and where there are valuable job opportunities
8495937 theoretically it should be impossible for two planes to collide so theres been obviously a failure a serious failure somewhere in the system but im advised that training there has been undertaken for many many years with a good safety record
8495938 i think one of the things that we would like to see over time is more of this sort of training undertaken in less densely populated areas and i suspect thats one of the things that may come out of the reports
8495939 its one of the busiest airports in australia i think there are something like 500 000 air movements there each year its also im advised one of the safest but obviously we want to ensure that the airports are as safe as possible
8495940 obviously yesterday was a tragic accident and tragic for the family concerned but it could have been worse we are grateful for the fact no schools or occupied houses were affected but we will look very closely at the report of the coroner and casa
8495941 i am sick to death of all this remorse and rehabilitation get down to basics if you commit crime you get sentenced
8495942 if the legal profession has got this sort of person coming through the ranks god helps us in the future
8495943 whatever is happening politically the bottom line is tomorrow morning the government is going to have to make a decision about building two power stations which are going to cost upwards of 10 billion
8495944 it doesnt have the money and it is going to come out of schools transport and other infrastructure budgets or alternatively the state will start to go into dangerous levels of debt
8495945 the business community is not only dismayed that it has happened it is confused by how it has happened because anybody who understands government finances and the energy issue thinks there was no alternative to privatisation
8495946 nsw now has a very dangerous situation where it cant invite the private sector to help fund this important infrastructure and it doesnt have the money in the forward estimates of the budget to do it itself
8495947 the defeat of the electricity sale is extremely disappointing and will have serious implications on the development of new transport infrastructure in nsw
8495948 it means that taxpayers money will stay tied up in obsolete coal fired power generators instead of being re invested in critical capacity building urban transport projects such as the m4 east and the proposed metro rail system
8495949 we would urge the liberal party to certainly reconsider supporting the sale this should be seen as bigger than politics
8495950 this is in the states long term interest and it shouldnt be viewed as a short term issue
8495951 this was one way to provide the money to have reinvested in the states grid to provide certainty of supply
8495952 the bottom line however is that the strong negative trend in summertime ice extent characterising the past decade continues
8495953 awesome bill from dawsonville had a season to remember in
8495954 we were always responsible people we never thought anything like this would happen to us
8495955 when we hear somebody speak of a baby when we hear a friend or colleague speak of being out drinking when we hear a fire engine or an ambulance
8495956 knowing it was the only 45 minutes that i would ever get to spend with her
8495957 a sea change in the cultural acceptance of drunken driving or lack thereof the city of boston is home to thousands and thousands of college students so we need to double our efforts

8495961 they were incredibly close their two characters just got married
8495962 like other members of the cast and crew jolene is struggling to come to terms with the death of her dear friend overnight
8495963 no one loved her doing it more than mark he was thrilled
8495964 they were devastated so we closed the set immediately as people were trying to come to terms with the tragedy
8495965 his work on stage and screen was admired by everybody who knew him
8495966 his death is such a sad loss we at channel seven will miss his energy and smile
8495967 our thoughts and prayers are with marks family and friends
8495968 most developers struggle with the nuances of making a database dance well to their directions
8495969 indeed a sql maestro is required to perform interesting queries for data transformations during etl processing or extract load transform processing or data mining during analytics
8495970 trivially parallelisable framework so that even novice developers aka interns could write programs in a variety of languages java c c perl python to analyse data independent of scale
8495971 on its own mapreduce can do a lot of important work in data manipulation and analysis integrating it with sql should just increase its applicability and power
8495972 now an employee can accidentally drop it into the lap of a random outsider without even knowing that anything is amiss

8495976 i dont know why this stock is so low the market is wrong its got a lot of divisions that are doing well i like it
8495977 i have a good call of this one their financials are opaque i think theyll need more capital but i dont trust them
8495978 i think this is one of those moments where we have to wait and see i think you buy some and wait i want to bank with verizon
8495979 no no no i dont want to be there ever since they got spun off ive felt like theres just not enough there
8495980 como siempre estoy muy agradecido por el cari o que me brinda la gente ahora vine con otra playera pero esto lo recordar por siempre
8495981 agradecido por su palabras que me brind tanto l como yo como los jugadores que est n ahora tratamos de sumar para el equipo y afortunadamente el equipo llega a estos 25 a os en los que ha ido de menos a m s para ser un equipo grande
8495982 el estilo de juego del equipo rival no serv a para dar un buen espect culo pero lo importante es el resultado salimos a proponer el partido y aunque no fue el m s vistoso de nosotros a final de cuentas seguimos sumando de tres
8495983 as parece y queremos confirmarlo el pr ximo s bado ante el monterrey que estamos en ritmo y tenemos el buen estilo de juego tenemos una buena racha y hay que aprovecharla
8495984 el equipo ha jugado bien yo creo que hemos merecido un poco m s de lo que tenemos hasta ahora y aunque es cierto que nos ha faltado gol tambi n nos hemos plantado bien concentrados y los goles llegar n en mayor cantidad
8495985 s la verdad se nos siguen dando las cosas en casa jugando de local la verdad volvimos a ganar el partido que la verdad fue muy complicado pero gracias a dios se nos dio y seguimos invictos en casa
8495986 fue un partido muy cerrado un partido de ida y vuelta el equipo de jaguares se plant muy bien en el cual nosotros tratamos de hacer nuestro juego que para eso trabajamos en la semana y tratamos de buscar una semana que fue clave para aunque sea ganar 1 0
8495987 as sabemos que ese equipo en su casa ha ganado los partidos y nosotros a seguir con la misma mentalidad tratar de seguir trabajando toda la semana para llegar lo mejor preparados el domingo y hacer nuestro partido tratar de conseguir los tres puntos y seguir con el mismo paso en el que vamos
8495988 es un equipo que en su casa los complica que juega muy bien el futbol all en su estadio pero tratar nosotros de ir a proponer y hacer las cosas para traernos nosotros el triunfo
8495989 we knew there were issues with stefan going back to last spring weve talked through it with him and we havent had any success
8495990 considered to be one of the top prospects in all of hockey and a well known player in canada because of his high energy agitating play and his off ice humor
8495991 look hes a kid with an enormous amount of talent and skill well a lot of other people have the skill to be a great doctor and yet they decide they dont want to be a doctor anymore hes a 19 year old who maybe has to grow up a little bit yet its not a health issue not as far as i know he wont be attending training camp hes taking time to think things over in my opinion stefan just wants to take a break hes tired from all the things hes gone through the last two seasons all the tournaments the games the shoulder injury all that stuff he feels like he needs some time and space
8495992 when does training camp start sept 19 or 20 until sept 20 he hasnt quit anything
8495993 absolutely yes i think were dealing with a case of burnout here you cant be filled with that much passion for the sport of hockey and decide right like that that youre done with it i think hes going to play again in fact i think when the frost hits the ground hes going to get the itch
8495994 i cant say hes in the process of reconsidering no hes not in the process of anything right now to be honest with you
8495995 i can tell them that we bought the team to have it here in columbus were dedicated to keeping it in columbus but i cant offer guarantees i am reasonably comfortable that well be here for a long time certainly every fiber of what we try to do is to fulfill that original thought my father worked on various sports commissions for probably 35 years to get a pro team for this town it was one of his dreams now sometimes in life you have to do what you have to do but i would consider it a personal defeat if we ended up in that situation

8496003 if we got to them faster some of them would have lived
8496004 what you find with speed humps is they kill more people than they save
8496005 there is just no way to quantify that it is a guessimate at best
8496006 do they slow us down into those areas yes they do thats what they were intended to do do they put us in a frame where we are not meeting the response time set forth no we do meet that criteria response time set by the medical authority
8496007 we would never claim that what we study in mice directly relates to how antidepressants work in humans but there are interesting features in parallel
8496008 the study unifies different observations that point to the brains dentate gyrus region and to creation of nerve cells as being important in depression
8496009 at least in mice this result directly links antidepressants and voluntary exercise with trkb mediated creation of nerve cells
8496010 we can get biochemical physiological behavioral and anatomical results in animal models
8496011 these all resonate with the human condition so perhaps you have a physiological relevancy
8496012 there could be a way to stimulate growth of nerve cells to fight depression for example
8496013 this is a startling amount of change in a major area of peoples lives over a very short period
8496014 we are excited to be googles first new zealand partner for the saas google apps google security google compliance and ediscovery products we led bringing salesforce com to new zealand and we are pleased to be leading again adding these google products to our saas business for our corporate customers
8496015 these products and services have not been available in new zealand for enterprise customers before so this is a significant development for corporate organisations
8496016 our saas business has increased significantly over the past 3 years with salesforce
8496017 with the saas business model there is nothing to install or maintain and fronde anticipates significant savings for corporate customers it will be great to see google and saas products being adopted in the enterprise space by new zealand businesses alongside our other saas solutions
8496018 allowing two people to remotely modify the same document saving a lot of time and eliminating miscommunication
8496019 there are a lot of smart young people out there who are very keen to end up living and working in new zealand
8496020 investigative reasons and also because of its poor quality the fact it only shows the man from behind and because the tonal quality of the black and white footage
8496021 the existence of the footage has never been a secret with it shown to 700 people during the exhaustive investigations to identify people inside and outside the hotel that evening supt byleveld said
8496022 police have been able to identify every one of the people in this vision except for this man
8496023 we would like this man or any person who recognises this man to come forward and contact crime stoppers on 1800 333 000 so that the special crime squad can complete this line of investigation

8496026 with sketchup we dreamed of a simple tool that would give people the ability to think fast and iterate often on complex building design problems with this release ies is plugging a set of energy analysis tools into sketchup at just the right level of complexity enabling designers to think not just about how a building might look but also how it will perform in a sustainable world
8496027 im incredibly excited by todays launch in many ways its a culmination of 14 years of work when i founded ies in 1994 my aim was to develop what were primarily academic tools and bring them into mainstream use by linking our tools directly to google sketchup and continuing to develop different levels of interface we are making the sustainable design potential of performance analysis very easily available to a huge number of professionals
8496028 we are very excited about the possibilities the ies sketchup plug in presents plans to extend this capability into the hands of more of our staff are already underway our energy analysis team is doing an exceptional job of documenting the work flow so that we will easily be able to engage others once the product is officially launched this connectivity allows many more of our architectural staff to take advantage of iess environmental analysis capabilities to better assure that our designs are being formed for optimal performance in early design
8496029 while riding the course i kept thinking to myself that we must be on the wrong road there is just simply no way a time trial would have this much climbing
8496030 at the reassurance from my coach and much to my delight we were on the right course
8496031 i was then able to trace the entire course from the comfort of my home and find a similar route to train on back in boise
8496032 this capability along with having the elevation profile proved invaluable in my preparation for my gold medal race
8496033 in general they are very ignorant about the fact that their potential clients and existing clients are using the internet while they are not doing so themselves
8496034 i think were still behind when it comes to the business community recognising the importance of being in front of their potential clients
8496035 with more than 90 per cent of all traffic generated on the internet coming from search engines it is important for the local business community to identify various ways of utilising these internet tools to achieve the desired visibility for their businesses
8496036 what the search engine looks at is the content of the pages and its relevancy
8496037 dont call yourself www welcometoourcompany com because that doesnt give any information about what you do what you sell and the search engine will not give the page value
8496038 it can help answer questions about why and at what point visitors are abandoning your website and if your website design is driving people away

8496066 the american government says mackerras has only to feed information into a giant international mass media machine to put its own views over to the western world p 183 here we can see that the long term national economic interests of america and the european states compliment the discourse pushed by human rights organisations
8496067 there are of course some industries in the west that try to combat this regime of truth by pushing a more positive image of china those industries that benefit from trade with china or that are keen to break into the china market their discourse however tends to be drowned out by the more negative one which happens to be backed by more players
8496068 empirical studies have repeatedly demonstrated a very clear link between economic development and human rights both collective and individual see for example the conclusion drawn by william meyer in his 1996 study titled human rights and mncs theory verses quantitative analysis published in human rights quarterly volume 18 p 368 his study found that gnp is the biggest contributor to civil political social and economic rights
8496069 the party deserves credit for the more relaxed political environment of today the people now live and act with a dignity that they did not know only a decade or two ago that is something to celebrate and a step forward in the move towards greater human rights
8496070 the link between economic development that is economic rights and political rights should be obvious
8496071 china currently falls in the middle income range and outperforms most other countries in its range on most indicators of human rights yet china is very often made out to be a far worse violator of human rights than it actually is little recognition is ever given to its human rights achievements which in many areas have been quite impressive

8496075 i have heretofore suggested that this peculiarity high alcohol and less acid might in a measure be modified by not allowing the grape to become as dead ripe as is usually done this would tend to increase the acid at the expense of the sugar which is in excess at best thus producing the excessive headiness for which california wines are thus far noted the vintners object to this course on the ground of the european precedent according to which every additional day of sun is accounted so much gain to the quality of the wine but what is true in the cloudy climate of europe is not therefore necessarily true in sunny california

8496096 obama and ayers both attended some 1995 board meetings of the chicago annenberg challenge which ayers was instrumental in starting and obama chaired in the 1990s ayers was part of the groups operational arm the chicago school reform collaborative which reviewed proposals for challenge grants and made recommendations to the board according to the organizations early documents during a june 1995 meeting ayers was credited with having worked diligently to support the board and the collaborative according to meeting minutes but more than a year later obama pushed the group to be bolder in its reforms minutes from an october 1996 gathering show obama a guest at a meeting of the collaborative raised questions about what the group should be doing the minutes characterized obamas concerns as twofold whether the group was raising additional money and whether money was being used to prop up existing organizations as opposed to creating fresh educational practices in the schools at the end of five years will we have broken the mold not much seems to be bubbling up that is inspiring or substantive the minutes say paraphrasing obama

8496136 ive kind of been texting him back and forth and hes doing great and wife lucy is doing great
8496137 on theoretical presumptions of course god has all the power he needs to do anything he wants any time he chooses but such theorizing is a very unscriptural way to approach the subject it has exactly that attitude that does nothing but produce frustration with what is actually in the book come to scripture with a nice respectable notion of an omnipotent god and see what it gets you problems thats what problems like if god has the ability to turn the world into the city why is he taking his own sweet time about it or if the bible is about an almighty all smart god why is it so full of divine indirection and delay or to say it flat out if god wants to turn this messed up world into a city or a kingdom why doesnt he just knock some heads together put all the baddies under a large flat rock and get on with the job the bible does of course have one recorded instance of gods having proposed just such harsh treatment the narrative of the flood in the book of genesis but even that story especially that story has little comfort it in for theology buffs who like their omnipotence straight up notice how it goes god having found all human attempts to build the city hopeless decides simply to wash everybody but noah down the drawn by the end of the story however when the final scriptural point of the episode is made it turns out to reveal a different notion of power entirely god says he is never going to do anything like that again he says that his answer to the evil that keeps the world from becoming the city if god will not paradoxically involve a direct intervention on behalf of the city instead he makes a covenant of nonintervention with the world he sets his bow in the cloud the symbolic development of which could be either that he hangs all his effective weapons against wickedness up on the wall or more bizarrely still that he points them skyward at himself instead of us
8496138 ow what the fuck are you ouch talking about am i decent what kind of ugh question is that

8496175 at this point i cant say what we expect from this feature were just curious to see how it will be used
8496176 unfortunately because the examples he provides are still only experiments we cannot talk in length about how they work if we end up rolling out this experiment for all users we would definitely be able to talk in more detail right now we are experimenting with a number of factors so we cant really explain how the final product would work
8496177 i think its important because the children have to own that classroom its their classroom
8496178 i dont know that the kids are eager to get back
8496179 because of the nature of the crime i feel that a lengthy sentence is appropriate to protect the safety of the community
8496180 i couldnt believe they turned him loose in the first place i had always considered him harmless up to that point
8496181 if we see mumps spreading beyond the current boundaries there will be more pressure to make some rapid decisions
8496182 what we saw in chilliwack was kids in middle and upper schools many of whom had one dose giving them a second dose in an outbreak situation gave them an extra level of protection
8496183 we appreciate the support and patience of our members during the strike and we remain committed to providing first rate service while maintaining the fiscal responsibility that we owe to our members
8496184 grassroots organizing has a new look the womens movement needs one too
8496185 critically but also very very sadly russia has not reconciled itself to the new map of this new region
8496186 the president of russia has said he was not afraid of a new cold war we do not want a new cold war and he has a big responsibility not to start one we need to raise the costs to russia for disregarding its responsibility
8496187 all these teams that you play at the end of the season present a challenge
8496188 you must be ready to play and you cant take anything for granted
8496189 zach gave us eight solid innings and they got the two runs in the one inning
8496190 duke did a nice job its unfortunate that we didnt score
8496191 marquis threw a very good game against us and when you get to the back end of their bullpen with marmol and wood its tough to get anything against those guys
8496192 to pass a guy to hit him getting into the corners and chatter his tires is what he did
8496193 i feel like i was extremely justified to do what i did
8496194 i needed to do it and thats the way it went lets make it real clear i am not apologizing for it and thats that
8496195 i dont think there is a right or a wrong i dont think there are any rules
8496196 the way this works is the way a real smart racer explained it to me after he wrecked me and i was real mad
8496197 he said i just had to look at your rear bumper and decide would you do this to me
8496198 afterwards he busch said sorry man my car was just faster so in my mind i had to ask myself when i went down there in the corner should i lift and brake early and do the best i can or should i just kind of give him a little tap and see what happens so thats the way it went and thats the decision i made
8496199 you just have to know at the end of the day the way you race people thats how they are going to race you back
8496200 if you can live with that and respect other people on the track you wont have a lot of problems
8496201 i think the conventions gone pretty well so far what do you think
8496202 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8496203 a lot of white workers and quite frankly a lot of union members believe hes the wrong race
8496204 everything ive learned in eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job

8496207 jonge vrouwen vallen op kale mannen en dan heb ik het niet over het hoofdhaar
8496208 voor onze thema uitzending hebben we een aantal jonge vrouwen bevraagd over hoe zij hun ideale man zien
8496209 en wat mij daar het meest bij opviel is dat nogal wat jonge vrouwen het echt als eis hebben dat de man absoluut geen haar mag hebben en dan heb ik het niet over hoofdhaar jonge vrouwen vinden het blijkbaar veel properder als een man zijn genitali n scheert terwijl je toch eerder zou denken dat dat haar daar staat net om de boel properder te houden lacht

8496211 vier jaar geleden was de batterij leeg en heb ik een andere pacemaker gekregen
8496212 ik heb er nooit problemen mee gehad tot twee maanden geleden
8496213 ik wist echt niet wat er gebeurde en schaamde me enorm gelukkig hadden de winkelbedienden snel door dat ik onschuldig was zelf had ik toen niet door dat dit pas het begin van de ellende betekende
8496214 uiteraard ga je dan zoeken naar een verklaring en kwam ik al snel uit bij mijn pacemaker mijn cardioloog verzekerde me echter dat die de oorzaak niet kon zijn

8496228 youd think that such a disconnect between anti war base and pro interventionist leadership would cause a few brains to explode but the only people who seem to be hearing the dissonance in denver are journalists this is not necessarily change that war weary obama supporters can believe in and in fact its much less change than a restoration of the liberal interventionism of bill clintons second term
8496229 in recent years the view has emerged that the inuit were coerced by the canadian government into abandoning life in scattered camps for centres of habitation in david damas demonstrates that for many years government policies helped maintain dispersed settlement but that eventually concerns over health housing and education and welfare brought about policy changes that inevitably led to centralization damas shows that while there were cases of government directed relocation to centres centralization was largely voluntary as the inuit accepted the advantages of village living

8496233 in these conditions the arf believes that the republic of armenia should not act hastily as it did in the case of kosovo
8496234 armenia has not even recognized the independence of karabakh because it doesnt consider that the international communitys ability to resolve the issue peacefully has been exhausted
8496235 the republic of armenia cannot discuss the recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia outside the context of the karabakh issue
8496236 we respect the right to self determination we have and will continue to defend the right of the people of karabakh to determine their own destiny
8496237 the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia has been recognized by the russian federation one of the co chairs of the osce minsk group and our strategic partner while the other two co chairs the united states and france have recognized the independence of kosovo
8496238 initially baku was excited by the conflict in georgias south ossetia region because it provided a possible blueprint for dealing with azerbaijans own restive separatist enclave of nagorno karabakh and for potentially imposing a new military reality on bakus regional rival armenia

8496246 unfortunately this is bad news for cork we will end our glasgow prestwick flight from october 28 we have had two meetings with the lads here in cork and in fairness to them they would like to do a deal on charges
8496247 we strongly refute the mis information contained in a press release issued by ryanair which claims that cork airport has raised fees by 20pc cork airport has not raised its charges
8496248 all airlines are eligible to apply for route support through the route support scheme rss when introducing new destinations the scheme operates over a five year period and is based on a sliding scale with a 100pc discount in year one in the second year of operation the discount moves to 80pc and so on over the five year period of the scheme
8496249 having availed of the 100pc discount provided by the rss on its east midlands and glasgow prestwick services since december 2007 ryanair has reneged on its commitment to the rss
8496250 the most frequently used is that the matter is still under consideration by the department
8496251 often takes two or three pages to say as much
8496252 these commitments were given in a programme for government over five years and not over 15 months

8496257 i had noticed her name in the last few days and thought it was a bit of a coincidence
8496258 i cut the ceremonial first slice of a roasted pig at the country market in ballinrobe on saturday last which i found tough enough because i am a vegetarian and i was a guest at ballinrobe races on sunday
8496259 i probably wont be as busy as the rose of tralee but there will still be quite a few public events to attend im really looking forward to it all but im not really thinking as far as the rose of tralee next year

8496274 how can you possibly expect the obama campaign to send someone to be on your show on short notice in the middle of the democratic convention
8496275 and now its in jeopardy i know it you know it but john mccain does not but barack obama gets it he worked his way up from nothing he could of written his own ticket on wall street but no he met with people who lost their jobs self esteem gone and he made their lives the work of his lives who was raised by a single mom who knows work is about respect and look your child in the eye and tell your child your going to be alright because barack obama made that choice
8496276 obama has the power to change it and change it is exactly what obama will do
8496277 mccain is my friend he has personal courage but i profoundly disagree with the direction john wants to take this country
8496278 a good soldier is not what we need change is what we need he will cut tax for 95 of the american people who draw a pay check h will transform the economy and create 5 million new green jobs and free us from big oil and that is the change we need he knows that those who out teach us today will out compete us tomorrow

8496282 entendo que at os 20 minutos do primeiro tempo o atl tico jogava bem teve as melhores chances duas bolas do pedro paulo com chance muito clara de fazer o gol e ali nos daria um alento uma for a muito grande para buscar o resultado e num descuido de uma bola sa da rapidamente n s levamos o primeiro gol
8496283 levar um gol de desaten o de um time da capacidade e do momento que o botafogo vive acabou desorganizando um pouco acabou dando chance a eles de fazer aquilo que eles mais queriam jogadores h beis velozes
8496284 aliado a todas essas nossas situa es o desfalque de jogadores importantes experientes que infelizmente estavam machucados e n o puderam jogar nesse jogo
8496285 o atl tico teve as melhores chances at o primeiro gol do botafogo for ou naturalmente que o botafogo jogava no nosso erro porque j tinha o resultado do rio vit ria por 3 a 0 e com a qualidade que tem com o entrosamento que tem ele acabou usufruindo disso

8496301 some observers believe that if mccain chose hutchison the republican senator from texas that could really shake up the presidential race and seize crucial convention momentum from obama selecting a woman as his vice presidential pick might appear to be pandering to women upset that hillary clinton wasnt selected as obamas running mate but pandering often works which is why politicians do it it would also add a sense of historic possibilities to the republican ticket something none of the men being mentioned would do
8496302 is it now more likely that mccain will choose a woman
8496303 i had no idea at the time that it was 1080 poisoning they were dying from it was awful they were out in the backyard along the fence and under the clothesline and some were still alive and wailing one was just flipping himself over and over that was all he could do

8496311 i figured once i cleared waivers and there wasnt really any action that id finish out the season in atlanta
8496312 but this obviously is exciting to come to a club thats in the playoff race and especially one like boston that has the history of a great tradition
8496313 unfortunately in atlanta things didnt go as well as we would have liked i see atlanta giving me this opportunity and we have to be thankful for that as well
8496314 the one thing ive heard from numerous people is if he can walk hell play
8496315 i know that ive gotten messages from people all over the league that said hes everybodys all time favorite i know hes a real professional i know hes excited about coming here
8496316 id have to say its my weirdest night as a professional in the big leagues
8496317 im just trying to come in and learn the playbook as fast as i can pick up some of the offense so i can go out there and try to showcase what i can do
8496318 whether it be punt return or offense i just want to contribute to the team
8496319 theres been a little bit of everything as far as picking a team whether its the last game first game
8496320 ive seen guys who dont really play in the preseason make it but its some kind of past performance that you make the decision on you just hope you make the right decisions
8496321 its the last chance i get to show my talents
8496322 i expect to get a lot of playing time a lot of reps so i have to take advantage of it
8496323 its frustrating because we are trying to get to a point to win a playoff spot but i guess you could safely saw we are playing as bad as the weather with walks and hit batsman and everything else
8496324 they did a great job getting the field ready and doug was out here all day
8496325 obviously theres a lot to do but he did a nice job
8496326 were looking forward to the new ballpark weve had a tour of the new place and its awesome but we still have a little work to do in this ballpark

8496335 saya juga tak gusar dengan pencapaian kami di awal musim ini saya masih merasa tenang sebab dengan 10 kali hasil imbang kami tetap mampu tampil sebagai kampiun bundesliga musim lalu

8496341 the committee is trying to educate themselves in all areas
8496342 when something like this came up they felt it was important they meet with him and hear what he has to say
8496343 there have been times when i wanted him to sit out but he decided he was going to go
8496344 he wants to get his timing down and all that when that happens i just try to manage the number of reps that he gets
8496345 i dont think anybody likes training camp but i need it
8496346 everybody needs it were rusty so we need it for our techniques to get in shape to get our bodies accustomed to getting pounded and getting hit and its good to get back into the playbook and refresh the plays its not all bad
8496347 the biggest reason hes lasted 15 years is hes a tremendous athlete
8496348 but he has seen a little bit of everything he understands what it takes to play this game how to prepare how to manage himself and he knows his body
8496349 ill get deep tissue massages soak in the ice tub and the hot tub and stretch
8496350 a lot of people think youve got to drink fluids the morning of practice and games but youve got to get hydrated the night before or days before you actually have to perform so i drink a lot all week water gatorade electrolytes at least a gallon a day
8496351 i take care of myself so i eat what i want i just work it off
8496352 every minute of camp is valuable so youve got to schedule your stuff when i get downtime i relax a lot of tv sleep if ive got business deals on the table ill handle that taking care of business outside of football but outside stuff thats not important is put off
8496353 the biggest thing i can appreciate is that here he is going into year 15 and when willie gets out there hes about working
8496354 on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8496355 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver the change everybody knows we need
8496356 like millions of americans theyre asking questions as profound as they are ordinary
8496357 it was because i was so bright i couldnt get the thoughts out quickly enough
8496358 she told me joey god sends no cross you cannot bear and when i triumphed she was quick to remind me it was because of others
8496359 my mothers creed is the american creed no one is better than you you are everyones equal and everyone is equal to you
8496360 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8496361 not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
8496362 no other country on earth is my story even possible
8496363 that is the true genius of america a faith in the simple dreams of its people the insistence on small miracles
8496364 few obstacles can withstand the power of millions of voices calling for change
8496365 together starting today let us finish the work that needs to be done and usher in a new birth of freedom on this earth
8496366 you have done what the cynics said we couldnt do
8496367 you came together as democrats republicans and independents to stand up and say that we are one nation we are one people and our time for change has come
8496368 you have to look at american culture and the fact that its been 400 years for these kind of racial attitudes to develop racial behaviors to materialize and youre certainly not going to wipe that out with just someone being elected to any office in the united states
8496369 i have never been so naive as to believe that we can get beyond our racial divisions in a single election cycle or with a single candidacy particularly a candidacy as imperfect as my own
8496370 when we passed civil rights bills in 64 and 65 and under lyndon johnson racial attitudes didnt change for a long time but over time as a result of those bills they changed dramatically and in the same way martin luther king didnt change peoples attitudes immediately but over time he had an enormous impact
8496371 caribbean vacations are at their lowest prices of the year
8496372 she said if you dont hear from me something is wrong
8496373 prosecutors have been beating war drums on this murder charge but have brought nothing but unsubstantiated allegations and no charges
8496374 they have not shown us since that mr fayed is involved at all in mrs fayeds death
8496375 she seemed to be doing ok with everything until this last year or so
8496376 not only do i think im a desi but i am a desi
8496377 i was strongly supporting hilary because i believed she would probably have a better chance of beating republican presidential nominee senator john mccain but even then i still liked obama very much i had been to all his fundraisers and i had been writing cheques for him and all that and had met him many times
8496378 but then two days before he clinched the nomination in june he called me twice and said i would really like to get your endorsement because in two days i am hoping to get over the threshold
8496379 i then asked him a couple of questions and i asked him about his commitment to united states india relations and where they should go and also about the india us nuclear deal he said that us india relations would be one of his highest priorities if he were president he assured me that he would support the nuclear deal and it should be passed the way it is without any modifications
8496380 i also asked him if he would consider including indian americans in his administration and he said definitely
8496381 he was very convincing and the fact that he called me again and reiterated his support for all of the three questions i had for him convinced me that would be a very good president so i endorsed him that day
8496382 i was among he final 10 super delegates to get him over the threshold
8496383 last year when he had hosted a major fundraiser for clinton in silicon valley i found that almost like 60 70 percent of indian americans were supporting hillary but then there was a big shift since i am representing indian americans in the dnc as an at large member and as a super delegate i thought it is my responsibility to represent their opinion
8496384 there are a lot of hillary supporters who have not yet endorsed obama
8496385 i am surprised how many of them have still not switched over
8496386 i was already doing that and in fact even the obama campaign asked me to help with that after the fund raiser they talked to me and said we really need your help in trying to bring over the hillary people

8496388 this really is one of the most significant steps forward for cancer prevention in new zealand
8496389 the ethical question is not whether it is right to vaccinate girls against a cancer that can be spread by sexual contact it is how best we can protect the lives of new zealands women
8496390 in fact medsafe fast tracked the registration of the vaccine for use in this country because the results of international clinical trials were so impressive

8496393 the staff that moves around the building a lot will now be able to carry a wireless companion phone around with them which will really act an extension of their desktop
8496394 if you realize a concession stand is low on hot dogs instead of waiting until you run out wouldnt it be great if when you ring up the one hundredth remaining hot dog your system automatically makes a call or sends a text message back to the kitchen
8496395 this is very similar to what we do at many of the large airports
8496396 youve got a large number of people coming in and out of the arena at different points in time during the course of a game you need to know exactly where to send your security staff and how to redirect them to those areas quickly
8496397 providing instant replays and statistics to all of our fans is a big one were looking at
8496398 another idea would be letting the fans vote on the three stars of the game its really about involving the fans
8496399 now theyll be able to put that players hockey jersey on sale in the pro shop right after the game and let the fans know through their cell phones
8496400 arena fans watching a replay on their phone might be able to do a close up on the type of skates a player is wearing and immediately order those online off of the canucks web site
8496401 that probably affected the timing of the deal more than anything
8496402 we decided to get started on the project now to be able to take advantage of the efficiencies and synergies during the olympics our in house system will be totally compatible with what vanoc overlays over top during the games
8496403 well i dont know about 900 horsepower but i have seen a bunch of engines over 875 horsepower
8496404 but changing engines whos going to pay for it theres no reason i see to obsolete everything weve got who would pay for that the manufacturers wouldnt except maybe one
8496405 i dont think anyone wants to make the racing less exciting do fans want to watch us racing volkswagens at 50 mph
8496406 we are damaging this world and its not just about carbon dioxide
8496407 weve got to learn to lead a sustainable life and a sustainable future as humans
8496408 people talk about environmentalism as a way to save the planet and i think thats very inaccurate its a way to save humanity because the planet is going to go on
8496409 as a society we need to invest in technologies and realistic alternative technologies
8496410 ethanol is a horrible solution whoever thought that changing food to fuel was a good idea was stupid hydrogen may be an alternative but the end all solution would be fusion technology
8496411 but i think that most people are willing to do whatever it takes as long as it doesnt affect them thats pretty much the consensus ive come to
8496412 whats really frustrating for me is although i am a firm believer in america and deeply patriotic and think this country does great things around the world its not always perfect
8496413 congress needs to reprioritize and if this country focuses on whats important weve proven we can do amazing things right now i dont think were there
8496414 and this is an ongoing activity every month how can we get something going on green racing
8496415 there was an e 85 corvette program running the american lemans series though that may have been cut to fund tony stewarts new
8496416 so how about running these big rig haulers on bio diesel
8496417 i think it is all something nascar would be open to and something all the manufacturers would be interested in talking with nascar about
8496418 but it would be a very very challenging process and not cheap and in todays economic environment i wouldnt expect it to happen overnight
8496419 mit grossem stolz gebe ich bekannt dass barack obama der kandidat der demokraten f r die pr sidentschaft der vereinigten staaten ist

8496422 i want to find out when we get punched a few times who wants to punch back who wants to take it and who wants to get up and give us something
8496423 the fact that nbc covered the main matches of pro beach volleyball at the olympics in prime time legitimizes the sport
8496424 our attendance has continued to grow the last three years and with this only our fourth year where weve taken it is a credit to the volleyball community in the area
8496425 i want to find out when we get punched a few times who wants to punch back who wants to take it and who wants to get up and give us something
8496426 i didnt play quite as well as i did the other day in the first round didnt find my rhythm but sometimes you just have to get through these matches
8496427 my leg was straight and i couldnt bend it the muscle was in spasm and i had a lot of pain
8496428 as you can see i am completely out of breath she really pushed me to the limit
8496429 i was just trying to come back to normal position where i could just stand up and regroup again and play the next point
8496430 i thought i was going to get my dress really dirty that was my biggest concern
8496431 i would have loved to take a nap on the court because i was really exhausted but you know the rules are the rules i had to keep going
8496432 its an amazing feeling i just play much more confident
8496433 we went inside the kitchen but they got us out they were talking and were in police uniform
8496434 they militants said we will kill you we pleaded with them not to kill us and said take all the belongings and cash but please spare us we have small children
8496435 they then locked all of us except my husband who they kept separately in a room
8496436 i had lost hope i had given up it was gods grace that they the children are safe i am also thankful to the army for getting them out
8496437 what makes the routine great is not that they are doing the most incredible tricks
8496438 its that they are hitting the breaks in the music so creatively and stylishly
8496439 are you even listening to the song do you even hear it
8496440 im expecting to watch film all day and get ready for the football game
8496441 we might have worked that very first team harder just because i was trying to run everybody off
8496442 i felt sorry for some of those guys we didnt know who the knotheads were so we just assumed everybody was
8496443 it seems much more realistic now than when i first got here
8496444 as a freshman if somebody at wake had said they wanted to win the acc title it was like speaking spanish nobody believed that wake could do it now that people believe we can do it weve got to own up to it
8496445 i was 15 years old and there with my dad
8496446 i remember it being cold and i remember the grass was just coming in and you really couldnt tell there was much grass out there
8496447 it was just tremendous because of the way the field kind of glistened even if it was cold
8496448 it was a big thing back then when the stadium opened and a lot of people were excited
8496449 it was just a happening and for some reason i kept the ticket stub all these years
8496450 the stadium was close to our house and i naturally loved baseball
8496451 i went to a lot of games in the 60s and 70s but i havent been to many lately
8496452 i remember we didnt get much better once i took over
8496453 i didnt do much better after i took over for george
8496454 i guess thats progress and you cant stand in the way of that im sure ill get a little nostalgic but thats ok
8496455 economics isnt something that i understand as well as i should

8496458 i believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country i have since the time that my mom took that position when she ran in 1970 as a us senate candidate i believe that since roe v wade has been the law for 20 years we should sustain and support it
8496459 romney has decided to support experimentation on surplus frozen embryos from in vitro fertilization procedures

8496464 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media
8496465 the more negativland started appropriating media the more we thought about it means
8496466 what do we now i know start a blog vent vent vent vent vent send mission accomplished i dont want to put down the idea of blogs the blog explosion has happened in part because more and more people completely distrust the joke of corporate mcnews
8496467 the blogosphere is limited to an echo chamber where all agree with all
8496468 when you look at big picture its pretty damn depressing but doesnt stop people from winning small local battles
8496469 this is a contest a war and its not red against blue or left against right its between the top and the bottom a class war is being waged in this country against almost everybody who lives in this country

8496474 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8496475 hillary told us in no uncertain terms last night that she is going to do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us
8496476 he has a remarkable ability to inspire people to raise our hopes and rally us to high purposes he has the intelligence and curiosity every successful president needs
8496477 he has shown a clear grasp of foreign policy and national security challenges and a firm commitment to rebuild our badly strained military his family heritage and life experiences have given him a unique capacity to lead our increasingly diverse nation and to restore our leadership in an ever more interdependent world
8496478 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8496479 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8496480 as a senator he has shown his independence of right wing orthodoxy on some very important issues but on the two great questions of this election how to rebuild the american dream and how to restore americas leadership in the world he still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years
8496481 you can learn an awful lot about a man campaigning with him debating him and seeing how he reacts under pressure you learn about the strength of his mind but even more importantly you learn about the quality of his heart
8496482 i watched how barack touched people how he inspired them
8496483 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can change change the change everybody knows we need
8496484 michelle obama kicked it off pretty well dont you think
8496485 president bill clinton reminded us of what its like when youve got a president who actually puts people first
8496486 it is wrong that senator obama got to go through 15 debates trumpeting his superior judgment
8496487 give me a break this whole thing is the biggest fairy tale ive ever seen
8496488 i love this and i thank you but we have important work to do tonight
8496489 on bush and mccains watch we have witnessed the growing influence of a belligerent iran that has destabilized the middle east and threatens our ally israel
8496490 americans have a clear choice in november john mccain offers more of the same failed policies that endanger america and israel
8496491 in his heart in his gut barack obama stands with israel not only his words but his deeds bear testament to this fact barack obama not john mccain led the fight in the senate by introducing divestment legislation that would deliver powerful economic sanctions against iran
8496492 i am disappointed for steven we knew he had a problem when he joined up with england for their last match but he said he would play through the pain tonight
8496493 the schools stare fixedly into the past as we hurtle pell mell into the future
8496494 they are characteristics of the spirit mood language and process of science they are operative wherever evidence of social change can be found
8496495 a new kind of person one who is an actively inquiring flexible creative innovative tolerant liberal personality who can face uncertainty and ambiguity without disorientation who can formulate viable new meanings to meet changes in the environment which threaten individual and mutual survival
8496496 new book out and making the move to open access
8496497 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
8496498 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
8496499 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
8496500 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers
8496501 like everyone he had been taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong something that only pirates would do
8496502 palestine calls to you support me liberate me i am your mother and you are my sons

8496506 i felt good thats the best ive felt in four five months
8496507 a big mug of coffee zoning out for about 30 minutes or so and then filling out my tps reports
8496508 a fear psychosis is being created to slow down certain projects of national importance
8496509 the nano project is an unique and innovative initiative that will establish indias position as a small car hub indian industry must be encouraged to make such large investments in order to build the countrys competitiveness as well as support job creation
8496510 we will review how the relaxation hours go and accordingly take a decision for thursday
8496511 it just shows his fertility is very high dr lynch said
8496512 when you look at it under a microscope its very concentrated very mobile and now weve had great success with the first two attempts two ais and two pregnancies thats the proof of the pudding
8496513 everyone thought oh thats so cute it just makes it real it just shows life and its really nice to see the calf moving around
8496514 this is the first pregnancy at the zoo its not just the first birth we have to manage the pregnancy manage the birth shes a first time mum dr lynch said
8496515 shes certainly a bit more clingy than usual id say when we come out in the paddock we do spend quite a bit of time with the elephants here and its not unusual for her just to follow you round the paddock

8496520 it just adds further trouble particularly this one because most of the people affected would be families that are already struggling because they are on welfare
8496521 to cut them off will only cause further homelessness problems and further family conflict

8496524 this increase seen with heated seats is unlikely to be a significant issue unless you are sitting in a car for a long period of time on a regular basis with the heater on
8496525 but these are the types of things men should be considering if they want to have a baby but are having trouble conceiving
8496526 the prospect of a custodial sentence is frightening for her
8496527 she has put herself in the position where her child will be without the mother of course many people would say well tough that is your doing you have brought this on yourself and must face the consequences what she did was thoroughly reprehensible but it has not been every case where a woman who has cried rape has gone into custody
8496528 but it has not been every case where a woman who has cried rape has gone into custody
8496529 as you can see i am completely out of breath she really pushed me to the limit
8496530 marked enlargement of his heart which had been failing for some time
8496531 im usually a pretty cool and calm guy before games but i was even yelling and screaming with the rest of them in warm ups
8496532 i couldnt really hear myself but i was screaming right along with everybody else they even had that tiger out there roaring it was a crazy experience its not often you get to do something like that its something ill cherish because im a fan first it was real exciting to get to go play at death valley
8496533 i doubt theres a place in the country that can match it those fans are loud and theyre right there on top of you theyre obnoxious but in a good way because theyre supporting their team
8496534 they are so passionate about their team about football and the state of louisiana its something you dont see in a whole lot of places going up to michigan last year theyre drinking wine and theyre waving you go down to lsu and theyre chugging beers and theyre throwing them at you
8496535 you dream about playing in playing at a place like that and having a chance to win
8496536 we were going about 60 mph downtown through baton rouge
8496537 there were two cops in front of us and two behind us there were eight on motorcycles theyd go block off an intersection and then youd see them go flying by you to get to the next one it was pretty crazy
8496538 the drive in there is an exciting thing for a 19 or 20 year old guy and its the same thing for an old coach
8496539 its exciting to go down that drive and have everybody hollering at you its a great atmosphere to play in
8496540 they had jamarcus russell skyler green dwayne bowe joseph addai
8496541 it was like being in the pro bowl or something like that i loved being out there playing with them
8496542 where im from i run when i see a dog
8496543 they had that big live tiger right there i didnt want any part of that
8496544 i am sick to death of all this remorse and rehabilitation get down to basics if you commit crime you get sentenced
8496545 if the legal profession has got this sort of person coming through the ranks god helps us in the future
8496546 i cant express my excitement in words i cant wait to get out there on saturday
8496547 its been a long time coming its a different atmosphere coming up for the home opener than weve had in the past
8496548 im ready to go im sitting here and im envisioning in my mind how the games going to go after we line up against those guys
8496549 we were at a point of so far away that weve kind of had miles to go before we sleep
8496550 overall the thing that has helped us get better is better practice habits
8496551 i knew the first time i saw this team that that was an issue i told them this today what we do at times is we try to revert back to 0 12 and 1 11 habits and thats not acceptable
8496552 were not the most talented team in the league by any stretch of the imagination but we have enough talent to be a good football team and when youre a good football team you can carry the game into the fourth quarter and find a way to win
8496553 when you buy into a guy with a record like that you definitely take heed to what hes saying weve been buying into it as a team and were ready to go out saturday and make it happen
8496554 our quarterback battle is a lot closer than i expected
8496555 well go into the ballgame with a starter the other two guys whoever is not starting jimbo will have a package for them
8496556 idc research shows that power and cooling efficiency and system density are among the top concerns of high performance computing hpc buyers today escalating system sizes and sharply rising energy costs are contributing to these concerns
8496557 ecophlex technology is designed to alleviate these issues for high end hpc users and could be an important differentiator for cray as they prepare to enter the petascale computing era
8496558 most large computers today exhaust heat into the air and then the computer room air conditioner crac units have to remove the heat from the air and put it into chilled water this method is very inefficient for a petascale system the area taken up by the crac units could exceed the computer footprint wasting precious datacenter space and energy
8496559 other systems use chilled water coils embedded in each computer cabinet and sometimes even embedded invasively into the compute blades with ecophlex technology you still use chilled water but much less of it and because of our unique engineering you dont need to worry about water condensation or leakage that could harm electronic components the combination of our ecophlex technology unprecedented upgradeability and environmentally friendly design philosophy makes cray systems the industry leading green solution
8496560 attempts to improve energy efficiency often involve lower power processors or reducing the frequencies of standard processors but this requires more processors to achieve a given performance level which reduces performance efficiency and since many application codes have limited scalability this strategy can reduce an hpc systems breadth of applicability making it a more limited purpose machine ecophlex technology allows hpc sites large or small to enter the muli petaflops era tackle the most daunting science and engineering problems and apply large numbers of high performance processors at industry leading densities while achieving strong energy efficiencies on a broad spectrum of applications
8496561 in addition to its cooling technologies cray continues to provide environmentally friendly multi generational cabinets to our customers most of whom have already upgraded two or three times in the same cabinets for a dramatic tco advantage
8496562 all too often buying the next generation supercomputer from a vendor requires a forklift upgrade replacement of the cabinets the hpc buyer bears the substantial added cost of the new cabinets and the old cabinets often have to be trucked off at some cost to a landfill with a negative environmental impact
8496563 he can run he can throw if somebody lets him be their starting quarterback hes going to be a star
8496564 the most important thing is to have the confidence of your teammates to know that if carson goes down for whatever reason that ill be able to get the job done
8496565 this is the one time of year that i know im going to get to play and its a chance to show my teammates what i can do i have a great relationship with a lot of guys on the team and im very comfortable right now
8496566 itll be good to run with the first unit for however long were in there just try to build upon what weve done so far this preseason and hopefully end on a good note
8496567 weve got a sour taste in our mouth from last week a 13 0 loss to new orleans in terms of some of the issues we had so were looking to execute a little bit better and start off right against baltimore on sept 7
8496568 i dont know ive always played the position of quarterback and ive always been real comfortable back there its just a matter of being comfortable with your surroundings and the offense and who youre with ive gained a good sense of that since ive been here
8496569 i guess its not as competitive as detroits jon kitnas i saw him and kitna in pregame throwing balls at the goal posts i think me being younger than him probably has something to do with how different our relationship is but theres a good amount of trust between us now just in terms of stuff that im seeing while hes on the field and us being able to talk about different plays and coverages he trusts what im saying to him
8496570 the biggest difference is where we came from hes been the star all his life the heisman winner and all that and i went to harvard hes always been in the limelight and ive kind of always been in the shadows at the same time the trust weve established with each other in terms of our football smarts and instincts is going to go a long way this year
8496571 senhor perdoai me pelas palavras que n o disse pelas promessas que n o cumpri pelas vezes que n o disse eu te amo por n o acreditar em vos
8496572 i think that three to five years is a good horizon to establish the planning figures for our work and that is what we will now have to see in detail with the pakistani government
8496573 it is indeed a humanitarian crisis if you have such levels of displacement in an area with instability with insecurity it is very difficult to fully respond to this challenge
8496574 there arent a whole heck of a lot of bad guys there left to fight
8496575 the business community wants to be engaged and we have to because we are part of the provider system
8496576 i used to do my own laundry when i was in college
8496577 i used to do my own laundry when i was in college
8496578 i know that laundry is his job but i cant tell you how many other things he does for a guy like me or the other coaches
8496579 the vehicle was going to pick up prisoners and as it reached a bridge an explosive laden car exploded and nine of our policemen and two passers by were killed
8496580 obviously he did things well enough that we think hes the guy we have to have under center to win the football game right now
8496581 its just a situation where we need what he brings to the table right now
8496582 but as ive said before you might as well go on and get it over get it out of the way and go on from there you never know how somebody is going to react maybe its going to make him 10 times better we are going to find out
8496583 doesnt matter if its quarterback fullback defensive back everybody is going to have to play you have so many young kids there that are going to be hyperventilating somewhere so well have to give them time to blow in the bag and get back to normal
8496584 we were last in the conference last year in rushing offense second to last in rushing defense and last in turnovers
8496585 thats a triple disaster right there we have to rush the ball better this season
8496586 in preseason practice we did scrimmage quite a bit for the first team quarterback
8496587 he made some mistakes in some practices but improved as we went he hasnt played in a lot of games we have to wait and see when live action starts this thursday hopefully our offensive line will have their best year the success of the offense depends on the guys up front
8496588 you dont know what youve got until you go play
8496589 were trying to stay under the radar with not talking too big well let our play on the field do the talking that needs to be said i dont know if we have a good team right now or an average team i dont know yet well have to wait until thursday
8496590 its important that we go and we play hard and we play smart you only get so many chances to do this thats one thing about being able to play on thursday night especially this thursday night because its the first one everybody that doesnt want to watch politics can watch football
8496591 well go on and well race him that way in the chase if thats the way he wants to race
8496592 a real smart racer explained it to me this way after he wrecked me and i was real mad he said i just had to look at your rear bumper and decide if you would do this to me and you had and so it was a real simple decision id do it again
8496593 jack put out a little statement saying its all about hard work and his people work harder than ours on any given day and i want to shake the hand of the man whos working harder than me
8496594 well ive got a list of 100 people who are ready to show up at fontana and stand in line to shake his hand because they all think theyre working harder than he is our guys work so much harder than jack roushs that its criminal
8496595 but it is what it is and its the same for everybody its not a waste of time regardless of what people might tell you
8496596 there are dozens of stories across the board of how people have fudged and it can go both ways up or down it depends on what your particular test is looking for if youre a guy with an independent engine shop trying to sell your product youre going to want to see really good numbers
8496597 and nascar understands that which is why were seeing nascar take engines back to concord for testing give nascar credit you have havent seen the chassis dyno since atlanta back in march and there it supposedly broke but it doesnt take six months to repair
8496598 i am going to do absolutely nothing for you or maybe ill pity you
8496599 the hands that help are better far than the lips that pray
8496600 it is through faith that a righteous person has life
8496601 good how was your weekend i want to see you soon
8496602 this contract award is an important win for boeing because it supports a cornerstone of the armys high energy laser program
8496603 hel td will give warfighters a transformational capability to counter the difficult threats posed by rockets artillery shells and mortar projectiles
8496604 boeing spent the past year developing the preliminary design of the hel td beam control system and we appreciate the confidence the army has shown in our efforts by awarding us these contract options to continue working on the program
8496605 the title is of great concern to us since the word is commonly used in a derogatory manner against people of the muslim faith or arab origin we have no desire to inhibit the creative process or your right to produce any film you wish
8496606 stop what youre doing or youre going to find yourself dead
8496607 the incredible feeling of betrayal from my colleagues id worked with these people for years
8496608 he has no identification papers no freedom of movement and no rights in this country economically or socially speaking instead he has been forced into a situation reminiscent of house arrest without any possibility of for instance earning an income
8496609 i am suing norway to check whether i have all the rights i am entitled to
8496610 im only demanding to get what i am entitled to and i dont care how people react
8496611 proud of what al zarqawi has done and that he has become a martyr
8496612 i think that whether you are muslim buddhist christian hindu or atheist you have to be able to bear insults you cant say im a muslim and that means i should be above criticism you can freely insult jesus christ you can mock other religions
8496613 deep in the mentality of danish people that we will not tolerate people saying you cant say or publish that there is a growing awareness in denmark that we have to keep it the bastion of free speech that it has been for many years
8496614 denmarks immigration policy is not going to change the voters need to know that the law holds
8496615 weve already written to some of our ambassadors and our friends ive spoken to the eu commissioner ive spoken to my french colleague and im in the process of writing to other colleagues
8496616 transport will cover long distances passing partly through inhabited areas we must know precisely what risks are involved and what to do if anything goes wrong
8496617 it was because of my first name ahmad and they said there were other names also on the blacklist
8496618 in practice there is no question of the fdfa proposing a dialogue with osama bin laden
8496619 did not state that she would promote such a dialogue nor has she proposed such a dialogue
8496620 she is a very dangerous person no doubt about it
8496621 this is a major haul a major capture for the fbi
8496622 to find someone who has such rich information computer hard drives e mails that is really a major capture
8496623 villagers had asked the militants to surrender before they laid siege
8496624 but the militants requested safe passage that was denied then the militants threw a hand grenade in the direction of the villagers to break the siege
8496625 we are seeing the writing on the wall if we dont prevent the taliban at this stage there is every possibility the military would launch an operation and the 11million population would be migrating in a state of helplessness to safer areas
8496626 we allowed them to work here for humanitarian reasons because we are helping them to earn money for their families to rebuild their homes
8496627 burning and looting were continuing this morning women are being molested and brutalised and extremists are doing what they want with them
8496628 please let the whole world that we should love one another we are al children of the same father
8496629 we will take our orders from sheik osama bin laden because we are his students al qaeda is the mother of the holy war in somalia
8496630 most of our leaders were trained in al qaeda camps we get our tactics and guidelines from them
8496631 should pretoria have taken tougher action about the south africans detained in uganda
8496632 this is additional evidence to the failure of the security approach adopted by europe as a solution to illegal immigration
8496633 europe has slotted immense funds for this approach which could have paid the debts of the countries of the south
8496634 there are no laws in the countries of the south that sufficiently protect the victims many of whom are young people
8496635 a stigma for some of the souths regimes and governments
8496636 and we find the laws drafted in europe as well as the funds are directed against the victims of immigration
8496637 the security approach including the radars the logistical means and the plans set by europe are not directed towards the illegal immigration mafias
8496638 this gives us a better picture of what countries discriminate against us based on religion
8496639 a total of 2 463 actual or attempted acts of piracy were registered around the world between 2000 and the end of 2006 this represents an annual average incident rate of 352 a substantial increase over the mean of 209 recorded for the period of 1994 1999
8496640 the concentration of pirate attacks continues to be greatest in southeast asia especially in the waters around the indonesian archipelago which accounted for roughly 25 percent of all global incidents during 2006
8496641 i think kicked it off pretty well dont you think
8496642 what its like when youve got a president who actually puts people first thank you
8496643 the whole biden family on this journey with me to take america back
8496644 we want to open up this convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the effort to take america back
8496645 i will leave it to others to decide the inspiration factor
8496646 i think the conventions gone pretty well so far what do you think
8496647 i think we will have a great night i look forward to seeing you there god bless you and god bless america
8496648 sources tell nbc the two men had tattoos and jewelry popular with
8496649 there is no reason for someone with a to have rifles with scopes
8496650 federal authorities have scheduled a press conference for tuesday afternoon amid reports that a fortunate traffic stop by aurora police may have disrupted an assassination attempt against barack obama
8496651 a witness interviewed in the case said one of suspects allegedly said the guns were to be used to kill the but authorities do not believe the alleged threat put obama in immediate danger authorities told abc news the men had tattoos of white supremacist images
8496652 cbs4 has now learned at least four people are under arrest in connection with a possible plot to kill barack obama at his thursday night acceptance speech in denver
8496653 the hotel where the pair of would be assassins was staying the cherry creek hotel at
8496654 apparently crack newsweek investigative reporter mark hosenball actually spied a couple of fbi agents lurking around the premises late last night hes looking into the matter now and well report back as soon as he hears more
8496655 an official speaking on the condition of anonymity says there is concern about the arrest considering the denver on monday people convicted of a felony are not allowed to possess guns
8496656 federal authorities have scheduled a press conference for tuesday afternoon amid reports that a fortunate traffic stop by aurora police may have disrupted an assassination attempt against
8496657 its unclear precisely why authorities suspect the men were targeting barack obama but one of the officers who was briefed says he was told at least one of the suspects made statements to that effect the secret service atf and the spokesman says the agency is concerned by the proximity to the convention and the items found in the mans car
8496658 when i first met coach stud after he got my name he asked me what position i played
8496659 when i told him i played defensive line he said why
8496660 they told me what they felt the best move would be so i took it
8496661 the encouragement has kind of died off because hes more self motivated and then knows what he has to do
8496662 if youre a defensive lineman you can get blocked the whole game
8496663 but those five plays you dont get blocked one of those can be a game changing performance offensive lineman you pretty much have to be perfect because if you miss a block that could be it
8496664 throughout the summer i probably spent about an hour each day going over film
8496665 we used to always come back from practice every day bruised and banged up
8496666 i see these guys more than i see well of course my family more than i see anybody else
8496667 we dont put any pressure on him we try and get him comfortable with us
8496668 i shouldnt have been i was stubborn but now thats the best thing ive ever done the more you can play the better
8496669 hes a really strong player and has pretty good feet
8496670 hes a really athletic player especially coming from the defensive side of the ball
8496671 everybodys going to have that problem its a little bit of a difference but its just like anything everything changes when you get to college anyway
8496672 they are one of the if not the most generous tribes in the nation
8496673 not just to surrounding communities but to indian people in general
8496674 theyve been tremendously generous to prior lake when weve had needs such as lights for our parks
8496675 but with some of the tribes they are helping were talking about the basics of life
8496676 we sat around for about two years scratching our heads wondering how we were going to get the thing going again once the fish were back
8496677 there are things that at one time were government supported and now theyre backing off
8496678 we might have been one of three legs of a project and one of the three backed off and we felt it necessary to do more
8496679 the top 25 list which we are not ready to release yet the shakopee group records an increase of about 44 percent two others in the top 25 have seen an increase of 40 plus percent and five in the 20 to 30 percent range so we do see that fluctuation and were not always sure whats behind it
8496680 for every one of you here you know good and well there are about 20 people in your life who arent registered to vote who arent paying attention who dont think it matters
8496681 but we dont have time to get this wrong if we were in a better place as a nation we could play that game we could afford to sit out and protest and show our discontent but see were not and every year that we wait every year that we dawdle every year that we hem and haw is another year away from our childrens future that we take theres nothing more powerful than your own voice talking to the folks in your own community
8496682 the reality is it is going to be up to us to get our people to the polls and do all the things we need to do to make sure that barack obama is raising his right hand on jan 20 2009 in washington d c
8496683 president george w bush won ohio by 119 000 votes in 2004 three hundred and nine thousand black people did not vote in ohio in that year
8496684 they robbed us in florida in 2000 but not this time
8496685 they took votes in ohio in 2004 but not this time
8496686 she was saying that she was going to vote for presumptive republican nominee john mccain if hillary doesnt get the nomination which she wont because that has been decided
8496687 it was a slap in the face because what do hillary clinton and mccain have in common other than that theyre both white it really undermines all of the work we black women did on the clinton campaign because it seems some of them were only voting for her because shes a woman and shes white
8496688 as african american women we have always been faced with that duality of being black and a woman
8496689 there has been the womens rights movement where there was racism and the civil rights movement where there was some sexism
8496690 the womens movement was supposed to be about uniting all women but it was really about uniting all white women
8496691 ive been extremely galvanized by this campaign and its so historic i just had to come
8496692 im hoping to see the city of los angeles develop a reputation for being a family friendly place to live it is my intention to carry out the mayors vision for using the libraries cultural affairs recreation and parks to create welcoming places for the citizens of our city and thats my charge
8496693 so i am excited about being able to bring the experience i had with the supervisor working with foster care and childrens services and first five and l a up i had a lot of understanding about what families need and ill hopefully be able to migrate that into what the city wants to have happen and marry the two
8496694 after she died i just couldnt go back to new york
8496695 i wanted to get less into the policy and more in the public affair side of community life
8496696 working on the red line blue line construction planning the whole gamut of all the transportation projects on the westside and thats how i got involved with working with supervisor burke because most of my projects went straight through her district
8496697 so i got a chance to work with her closely i was fortunate enough to be offered a job i came here to do budget and i didnt find out until i was being introduced to the rest of the staff that someone else was going to do budget i was going to do children services
8496698 well over the years i learned that its really not that simple that theres good and bad on both sides that in many cases a mother who is neglecting her child is an unparented child herself and that the way to help that is to teach that mother how to be a mother to that child and thats really whats needed
8496699 the system at that time didnt support that vision the vision grew in me i was introduced to the whole world of foster care and that vision grew in me that indeed the thing to do is to find out how to keep these children with their mother because even though she doesnt fit my rule my idea of perfect she loves the child and theres value in that and the child loves her so what can we do to keep those two together now in a case where a child is in danger they will have to be removed but the majority of the children we come into contact with are neglected and neglected meaning their clothes arent clean theyre not being fed theyre not being taught theyre not disciplined theyre made to go to school
8496700 to help the county navigate and use something that grew in the second district that was once called the compton project which was this idea of helping the mother or helping the families stay together
8496701 from being an isolated program down in compton to now being the county standard of how we deal with families and from that to being a national model on how to deal with this issue of abuse and neglected children and families and to take the idea from my limited understanding about just the little kid and realizing that that kid is attached to siblings to a parent and that we do them just a disservice by breaking that if its broken unnecessarily
8496702 what im most concerned about is that these are people that were missed by every system
8496703 they didnt get educated they graduated or they got social promoted along or they dropped out theyre not attached necessarily to a religion or a church they dont know how to live in this society they get bumped along and helped temporarily but their mental health issues their depression their fear just the stresses of straight out poverty should not be overlooked

8496705 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8496706 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8496707 over the last 15 years us humans have exceeded the worst case scenario in greenhouse gas production
8496708 and a 12 degree temperature increase would alter the earth in significant ways we need to take action quickly
8496709 there are people where you can just see it on their faces
8496710 ive talked to a number of lifelong democrats who are really excited and some republicans who are conflicted
8496711 you get some that like to walk on the other side of the aisle and just take a side look then there are people who come up and you say hi to the people you havent seen in a while
8496712 i think theres more local money coming in now and they democrats are paying attention now more than ever
8496713 if adolf hitler ever ran for president hancock county would vote him in
8496714 i think youll have some more democrats voting this year
8496715 a lot of them recognize the routson name so they stop to ask who jeff is
8496716 its a principle of law that a penalty should match the seriousness of the crime
8496717 what we needed most post flood was bodies and equipment to haul away all that trash
8496718 i think when all was said and done we hauled away over 10 million pounds of trash
8496719 they came in on front loaders and dump trucks like the calvary
8496720 if it werent for them we would have taken months not days to clean up our city
8496721 we deal a lot with moving materials so really that is our expertise
8496722 we have people that know how to load run loaders and run dump trucks so it was right up our alley
8496723 the people we have here when they go out on a snowstorm they realize that its their family and neighbors driving on the roads so they take their job very seriously
8496724 when they had an opportunity to be of service to people who were hurting they took it really seriously and did their job
8496725 i dont see how it could have been done any better they performed above and beyond in my opinion
8496726 with hair you cut away and with wood you cut away
8496727 just because i cut it doesnt mean ill ever cut it again
8496728 im doing girly stuff in the salon and hes out hunting
8496729 we agree with the humane society that there is an inherent conflict of interest between the humane society and the dog warden
8496730 over the years employers have commented on the fact that students sometimes come inappropriately dressed to interviews or work experience placements
8496731 hopefully the fashion parade will provide an idea of what to wear or what not to wear in different professions
8496732 this also included safety equipment needed in the construction and mechanical industries
8496733 it is an emergency we dont like seeing these but we are very reliant on water and should be thankful sa water handled it so well
8496734 a more extensive public consultation would have alleviated public concern around town
8496735 the maintenance should have been published in the paper and also on television to notify residents
8496736 it doesnt cause any problems with anything connected to plumbing and it is just one of those things that happens
8496737 it was handled really well and put back on in a short amount of time
8496738 the roads did not improve until we were in victoria
8496739 not many locals had the chance to go to melbourne back then let alone ride there
8496740 it is so exciting i hope they jump out of the water
8496741 rather than drop their heads the boys showed some spirit and got behind each other
8496742 they held their heads high against tough competition and that is something they should be proud of
8496743 the best part was going to an afl game and watching the girls play their final
8496744 nowadays when you put your bin out it is the start of a major industry that employs hundreds of people and millions of dollars worth of infrastructure and equipment
8496745 south australia has a waste recycling diversion rate from landfill of about 68 percent and after all recyclables are sorted and removed the remaining rubbish which is a huge amount is contaminated plastics that go to landfill
8496746 these sites must be lined fitted with drainage pipes covered with gravel and geo textile then the rubbish is placed on top and covered with clay and a methane extraction system is fitted
8496747 all of this in my view could be cost prohibitive for a council of our size so a shared commercially operated site may have to be evaluated
8496748 a lot of larger and smaller regional councils have already implemented this system and unfortunately all these costs will go through council and then be burdened on the ratepayers
8496749 waste management and recycling will be the only acceptable method of disposal but it comes at a big cost
8496750 i thought why not and went into the station and filled in an application to be a police officer
8496751 six weeks later i started a twelve month course at the fort larges academy
8496752 i was called to an assault on a woman and at the conclusion of the job found out that the person was really a man
8496753 i was apprehensive at first coming back as a police officer amongst my friends but they are decent people and have never put me in an awkward situations
8496754 in fact i have never had an issue in port pirie with friends or crooks
8496755 my philosophy is that i treat them how i would want them to treat me
8496756 i am left handed and totally useless with my right hand that is why i am a goalie because hockey is a right hand sport
8496757 it is really about mates and comradery more than sport
8496758 i was lucky that i played cricket for props in the summer and football for lions in the winter two different clubs and different mates
8496759 not only did we flag up problems we flagged up solutions
8496760 you dont just wake up one morning and kill somebody
8496761 if you seek advice from a number of individuals who make recommendations and you do not put those in place that is a pretty challenging place to be
8496762 we gave some pretty good recommendations i think some of these need to find their way back to those who are responsible for taking decisions
8496763 i find it difficult to say what we are doing could be described as not acting
8496764 giving even more democrats and supporters an opportunity to hear from governor bill richardson his speech has been moved from this evening to a featured speaking slot tomorrow at mile high because of such an enthusiastic audience response the long running schedule led the democratic convention to ask the governor if he would speak tomorrow and he graciously agreed he will be speaking to 75 000 people and a nationally televised audience
8496765 these are my principles if you dont like them i have others
8496766 calon bn baik tetapi kalau beliau menang maka datuk seri abdullah ahmad badawi akan dakwa yang dirinya menang dakwa yang sokongan kepada bn iaitu pada dirinya sudah kembali dakwa bn telah dipulihkan dibawah kepimpinannya
8496767 saya percaya dengan berat hati penyokong penyokong bn telah undi pkr supaya abdullah akan sedar yang kepimpinannya tidak dikehendaki lagi
8496768 calon yang diletak sesuai juga apakah yang tidak kena dengan bn mungkin inilah mesej yang ingin dihantar oleh pengundi bahawa rakyat menolak kepimpinan abdullah
8496769 namun mesej yang hendak dihantar oleh pengundi melayu cina dan india menjadi sia sia kerana abdullah tidak ada telinga untuk mendengar dan tidak ada mata untuk melihat
8496770 pilihan bagi umno hanya dua setia kepada abdullah dan kalah dalam pilihanraya umum ke 13 atau setia kepada umno lebih daripada setia kepada abdullah dengan kemungkinan menang pilihan raya umum ke 13
8496771 untuk menang calon umno perlukan undi orang bukan ahli parti serta orang cina dan india
8496772 dalam keadaan sekarang iaitu umno dan kerajaan yang dipimpin oleh abdullah tidak mungkin orang bukan daripada umno akan beri kemenangan kepada calon umno atau bn
8496773 i remember him as a very tough guy he was a hard runner and a hard worker
8496774 he gave you everything he had on every play he was a good football player
8496775 he loved the game of football he worked very hard at it
8496776 what happened in permatang pauh was not something so big as to change the situation that exists after the last general election
8496777 it is time to face the music it is we who have been buried
8496778 he does not have the minimal credibility needed to run the country day by day let alone to take it in the new directions we need to go in a complex world he may not have the credibility needed to keep the country together
8496779 it is a rejection of our leadership and if there is no change we will be faced with a change of government sooner than we expect
8496780 they are saying they dont want to be taken for granted any longer
8496781 are you going to be on the wrong side of history if obama is elected president
8496782 deference to our journalistic tenet that opinion pieces are edited solely on form never on content
8496783 it is being blocked because we found that some of the comments on the website were insensitive bordering on incitement
8496784 so i had to type it in to access mt if true it simply shows that the bn is becoming more brain dead than before they are beginning to behave erratically in panic clutching at straws
8496785 central front in the in his convention speech wednesday night vice presidential nominee
8496786 a troop increase is likely to inflame afghan nationalism because afghans are more anti foreign than we acknowledge and the support for our presence in the insurgency areas is declining the more responsibility we take in afghanistan the more we undermine the credibility and responsibility of the afghan government and encourage it to act irresponsibly
8496787 unless the next american president builds on the existing commitments to help lift the afghan people out of extreme poverty and protect civilians it will be impossible for the country to achieve lasting peace
8496788 but in the game the clock was stopped while the arbiter was called to the table
8496789 it is a big plus to allow two lanes this year
8496790 we anticipate that the construction on burbank will cause delays
8496791 if you have 100 000 people on campus its like trying to get the entire population of ascension parish out at the same time
8496792 i usually drive here early to get a good spot since i live 20 minutes away
8496793 it takes almost an hour to get where im going and the only other option is to stay around and wait

8496798 delaware can get another senator but my boys cant get another father
8496799 the power of our example more than the example of our power
8496800 lets raise awareness show support and build relationships to save our youth
8496801 the violence is starting to creep up weve got to get a hand on it
8496802 dozens more have been physically injured and countless more wear emotional scars and these emotionally scarred youths are survivors in the true sense of the word and need our support to heal
8496803 before youths can break habits of violence or become equipped with the tools to think and act in healthy ways they must first realize that change is necessary and possible
8496804 children who experienced regular care by their fathers in the years prior to schooling showed higher levels of cooperative behavior

8496817 i mean when is the last time we elected a president based on one year of service in the senate before he started running in theory we could find someone who is a gifted television commentator and let them run
8496818 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8496819 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8496820 at this particular moment i look for the seasoning and the experience the demonstrated strength and toughness that i think its going to take to actually produce the results that people need in their daily lives i think that clinton by virtue of her life experience has a little bit more of that
8496821 the goal is to create cells that are missing or defective in people its very exciting
8496822 this is a win win situation for medicine and ethics
8496823 you can fight a war with some objective less than total victory
8496824 we dont forecast the ports our ships are going to be pulling into
8496825 the ships are performing duties on maintaining peace and stability in abkhazia and in the republics territorial waters
8496826 among the duties we are performing is control over abkhazias territorial waters and the prevention of the trafficking in arms we are also carrying out a humanitarian mission
8496827 weve been moved up a day and that is not going to hurt us at all
8496828 i think it helps us because we are so dang ready to play a varsity game
8496829 christmas is coming early and that part has got me excited
8496830 everybodys butterflies have moved up i am excited but apprehensive because of the not knowing i think we are pretty good but we will see on thursday
8496831 i want them to come out hungry like a heavy weight prize fight
8496832 this is the beginning of the season and it is my favorite time because everybody is trying to establish themselves it will be interesting to see what kind of fortitude we have
8496833 this is an option team that we are facing and our defense is going to have a lot of responsibilities this week
8496834 our defensive ends stanley thomas and two willis have got a big portion of that responsibility but then again so do our linebackers tackles and backfield weve been preparing for these guys and it is going to help us to be playing them at home
8496835 they are ultra talented because we watched them scrimmage mcarthur and whooped on them pretty good
8496836 but that is just my nature i like to just get after it but i have to be patient and not put us in a bad situation so that hopefully we will have a chance in the fourth quarter
8496837 he seems to be uncowed and unapologetic about anything that is happening
8496838 im confident the final results will give us a primary victory and we can move on to the general election
8496839 im not stepping down im going to run through and win this election
8496840 we have already seen attempts to buy this senate seat by outsiders who do not represent the best interest of alaska
8496841 theyve staked their careers on providing for people in communities through earmarks and other says
8496842 thats created a lot of obligations particularly in the construction industry and industry that relies on buildings and facilities and roads and whatever it might be theyre sort of collecting those chips now at least sen stevens is
8496843 on energy alaskans know that i will fight every day to open anwr while mark tells his liberal friends that he is carefully cautious about drilling and only wants move forward when the environment is right
8496844 now is the time to open anwr and alaskans will need someone with experience to get that job done
8496845 this is going to be a battle between a younger person not quite as mature as i am not as experienced as i am does have talent do they want to do that replacement at this period of time
8496846 it has always been a rivalry since ive been here and this is my 13th year
8496847 they are the only team that weve played year in and year out we played el campo for a lot of years except this year and the same with sweeny weve played them a lot but there were a few years we didnt
8496848 this is my 11th year at columbia and at one point we used to be district rivals
8496849 since ive been here we are 8 4 against them
8496850 we feel real pleased with the progression of our team in the preseason because we only have a handful who have experienced friday nights
8496851 only these six know what those lights look like but so far so good our progression is better than expected because of our offense execution and i feel good about our defense because i believe our kids know our scheme defense is a priority for us and has always been but i believe theyve picked up from where we left off from last year
8496852 weve seen some great things from raley this year so far he can read defenses better and is taking charge of the offense
8496853 if he can stay calm and poised and take care of the offense and run our offense he will be all right but we want to do different things with this offense and not put the game on his shoulders entirely
8496854 they are physical and are a powerful team and it will be one of our tests in a tough schedule
8496855 but we are hoping to make it a successful first step for us to start off the season they probably have more experience as far as starters and returning lettermen the key for them is size but weve got to rise to the occasion and overcome their size and experience
8496856 offensively we need to maintain our drives and not have silly penalties
8496857 we also must not have turnovers and that is our no 1 key not to kill our own drives
8496858 for us it is going to be important to line up and take care of our assignments
8496859 no position is safe on this football team and some of those spots are still in competition for starting spots
8496860 the iraqi government wants to finish the whole thing very soon
8496861 we need more jobs better education health care for everyone we all want that dont we that means we want change which is what my campaign has been all about
8496862 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8496863 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8496864 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8496865 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8496866 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8496867 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8496868 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8496869 kalau memang tiga terpidana yang diduga melakukan pembunuhan terhadap asrori tidak bersalah maka mereka harus dibebaskan mereka juga bisa mengajukan gugatan pra peradilan kepada polisi
8496870 mit gro em stolz gebe ich bekannt dass barack obama der kandidat der demokraten f r die pr sidentschaft der vereinigten staaten ist

8496872 bei den jungen menschen steht der verkehrsunfall im vordergrund bei den nichtt dlichen unf llen sind sportunf lle im vordergrund aber diese gehen zum gl ck in den seltensten f llen t dlich aus
8496873 kita melakukan exercise kepada kejati kejari pasca urip ditangkap kita lihat beberapa bulan ke depan kalau tidak serius sudah cukup terhadap institusi ini
8496874 ini penegakan hukum tidak mesti di kpk harus dibagi bagi peran selama ini kpk menangkap politisi tapi untuk yang kecil kecil tidak
8496875 jika 9 orang dari kami ditangkap kalian harus meneruskan aksi di sini
8496876 ini kemenangan kita karena polisi tidak menyerbu dan menangkap kita semalam
8496877 while most americans were struggling the good times were rolling for the top 10
8496878 when income concentration creates barriers to the resources and opportunities that would enable people to get ahead on their own initiative and efforts that violates our fundamental sense of fairness
8496879 i think the world of demeco because hes special in a lot of different ways
8496880 let me start with his attitude hes so unselfish hes not egotistical hes very humble the team and the organization mean a lot to him and winning is the most important thing to him
8496881 yeah it does but demeco came to us with a great foundation
8496882 i couldnt believe his knowledge of the position when he got here
8496883 he understands concepts it was easy for him to pick up our system
8496884 his emotional level is ideal never too high and never too low i could talk all day about him i love the kid
8496885 hes everything you want a great player a great leader and a great teammate
8496886 hes got a smile on his face all the time not only does he have great ability he works hard all the time hes never critical of another player he just gives them a pat on the back thats one reason hes such a terrific leader
8496887 first of all i think the middle linebacker has to be smart
8496888 he has to understand what were trying to do because he has to put everybody in the right position
8496889 i may get tired chasing people but its never going to show
8496890 if i had to come off the field i wouldnt feel like i was completely in the game i like to be in the middle of the action and stay there
8496891 were more competitive on both sides of the ball this season
8496892 the visionary lies to himself the liar only to others
8496893 asean india trade accounts for only 2 percent of aseans global trade so the potential of bilateral economic cooperation is profound
8496894 as soon as possible when the asean countries are ready
8496895 obviously hes a bigger tight end and he has an edge about him
8496896 he definitely brings an attitude to our offense and to our team and thats something i feel will definitely help us
8496897 marques colston drew brees reggie i want to help these guys play at a higher level and do as i try to do every year which is to do the best i can
8496898 i wouldnt go so far as to say that game is a four letter word to us but we dont think of ourselves as a game company

8496942 people need their services no matter what is happening with the market
8496943 banks have really been hit over the head by restrictions on how much they can lend and who they can lend to

8496972 he also touched on the history of how he became governor and on the same theme as obama has things can and should and will be better
8496973 he touched on some of the themes and stories many of us in massachusetts have heard before it was his introduction to a national stage and i think conducted himself well

8496986 everything ive learned in eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8496987 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8496988 a leader who can deliver change the change that everybody knows we need
8496989 the candidate who once promised a contest of ideas now has nothing left but personal attacks

8497127 who is randy scheunemann he is the principal foreign policy adviser to john mccain but randy scheunemann has another identity another role he is a dual loyalist a foreign agent whose assignment is to get america committed to spilling the blood of her sons for client regimes who have made this moral mercenary a rich man
8497128 now scheunemann is the neocon agent in place in mccains camp the neocons got their war with iraq they are pushing for war on iran and they are now baiting the russian bear is this what mccain has on offer endless war

8497136 these are extraordinary times this is an extraordinary election the american people are ready barack obama is ready this is his time this is our time this is americas time
8497137 i profoundly disagree with the direction that john wants to take the country
8497138 ive been on the ground in georgia iraq pakistan and afghanistan and i can tell you in no uncertain terms this administrations policy has been an abject failure
8497139 again and again on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8497140 and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8497141 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8497142 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8497143 after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home
8497144 be there because barack obama and joe biden will deliver america the change we so desperately need
8497145 joe biden is right we need more than a good soldier we need a leader with the experience and judgment to serve as commander in chief from day one that leader is john mccain
8497146 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need

8497158 in theory there is no difference between theory and practice but in practice there is
8497159 well do our best to track down how it got there and close that gateway
8497160 this is not a frequent occurrence but we have had viruses that have made their way on board before
8497161 whatever is happening politically the bottom line is tomorrow morning the government is going to have to make a decision about building two power stations which are going to cost upwards of 10 billion
8497162 it doesnt have the money and it is going to come out of schools transport and other infrastructure budgets or alternatively the state will start to go into dangerous levels of debt
8497163 the business community is not only dismayed that it has happened it is confused by how it has happened because anybody who understands government finances and the energy issue thinks there was no alternative to privatisation
8497164 nsw now has a very dangerous situation where it cant invite the private sector to help fund this important infrastructure and it doesnt have the money in the forward estimates of the budget to do it itself
8497165 the defeat of the electricity sale is extremely disappointing and will have serious implications on the development of new transport infrastructure in nsw
8497166 it means that taxpayers money will stay tied up in obsolete coal fired power generators instead of being re invested in critical capacity building urban transport projects such as the m4 east and the proposed metro rail system
8497167 we would urge the liberal party to certainly reconsider supporting the sale this should be seen as bigger than politics
8497168 this is in the states long term interest and it shouldnt be viewed as a short term issue
8497169 this was one way to provide the money to have reinvested in the states grid to provide certainty of supply

8497173 fedex refused to bargain because these workers are contractors not employees
8497174 its not against the law to work for yourself which is why more than 10 million americans pursue that work lifestyle every day
8497175 this bill is going to create france in the u s
8497176 one thing that stands out in the research is how routine this all is
8497177 these elections havent been free or fair in the 20 years i have studied them during an organizing drive the workplace is a totally coercive environment workers are not making a free choice
8497178 but while its been battered the idea of workplace democracy has not been drained of its last ounce of vitality
8497179 the corporate merry go round has hitched its wagon to the democratic party and the rhetoric of the democratic party has responded accordingly
8497180 if we were in the debates we would have a three way race
8497181 but tens of millions of americans have never been told we are even in the race
8497182 i think nader has less appeal than he did in 2000 or 2004 but he deserves to be heard
8497183 its a combination of what we give them and what they can add to it
8497184 at the moment all i know is i have the great pleasure to go and jam with the two guys and start work on some material whatever it ends up as to ever get a chance to jam with two people like that it is a phenomenal thing for me its my life its what ive dreamed about doing
8497185 lots of politics would need to get ironed out before an album could be made
8497186 the goal is to create cells that are missing or defective in people its very exciting
8497187 this is a win win situation for medicine and ethics
8497188 there are a lot of aspects that look like a right wing think tank im very worried about that possibility
8497189 people are concerned about the blurring of the line between friedmans technical work in economics and his fairly well known persona as a political advocate of a very pure free market conservative or neoliberal position where the market is the solution to everything
8497190 donors will receive reports and attend lectures but they wont belong to the institute
8497191 they will have nothing to do with its direction and no economist worth their salt would take that kind of direction anyway we will bring in people from all over the world with all different approaches
8497192 talking more broadly about the intellectual portfolio of the university
8497193 as we gather here tonight our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8497194 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8497195 ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be the president of the united states
8497196 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us
8497197 actually that makes 18 million of us because like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8497198 barack obama and i took very different journeys to this destination but we share a common story
8497199 mine began in scranton pennsylvania and then wilmington delaware with a dad who fell on hard economic times but who always told me champ when you get knocked down get up get up my mothers creed is the american creed no one is better than you you are everyones equal and everyone is equal to you
8497200 you can learn an awful lot about a man campaigning with him debating him and seeing how he reacts under pressure
8497201 you learn about the strength of his mind but even more importantly you learn about the quality of his heart i watched how he touched people how he inspired them and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8497202 i mean when is the last time we elected a president based on one year of service in the senate before he started running he would have been a senator longer by the time hes inaugurated but essentially once you start running for president full time you dont have time to do much else
8497203 i know you hear that phrase a lot in politics i mean it
8497204 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8497205 and president clinton reminded us of what its like when you have a president who actually puts people first thank you
8497206 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and country lets declare together in one voice right here and right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8497207 i move that senator barack obama of illinois be selected by this convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party for president of the united states
8497208 nobody is asking what is happening in the republican party why mccain did not invite muslims or why there are no muslims in his cabinet why he has not visited a mosque
8497209 i think there are occasions where you have acutely felt that our national party was not as open as you wanted it to be you are a part of this party and we are a part of you we are stronger as a party and a nation when we make room
8497210 we have a once in a generation nominee in barack obama who can help us find our way back to each other in common cause
8497211 the democratic party embodies the best interest of the american people and they should support the values that underlie that
8497212 i think the idea that americans are bigoted and will not tolerate muslim leadership is not true and we should simply start setting the record straight
8497213 nothing you say is going to be as important as what you do
8497214 its like the ice cream truck they come running out when they hear that horn
8497215 were going there to help people and we sure dont want another katrina catastrophe
8497216 the concern here is to make sure that we have an adequate response
8497217 thats what washington d c does they work with all the states to make sure that the people on the ground have the resources to respond
8497218 the continuous sharp decline in share prices can have implications for the wider financial system
8497219 to develop medium term measures for achieving stability in the capital market
8497220 it just really shattered my whole idea of suicide and what it looked like

8497227 can you please give us the response and refusal rates for your most recent national poll
8497228 as far as i know we dont publish response and refusal rates we conducted the poll for the associated press youd have to ask them about releasing the response and refusal rates
8497229 we dont have them here from ipsos it takes a little while for them to get those to us i can ask them it shouldnt take too long but normally it takes a few days theyre not secret or anything
8497230 can you please give us the response and refusal rates for your most recent national poll
8497231 a reasonable approximation for the response rate on the economist wave of august 4 6 would be 43 the opt out rate from our mailings was 4 my best guess at a comparable statistic to refusal
8497232 can you please give us the response and refusal rates for your most recent national poll
8497233 but knowledge is power lets take advantage of this and be safe
8497234 heres a stark statistic for you of fatal crashes 93 percent had no training
8497235 theres a core message which anyone should be able to look at and go gee whiz maybe some training would help me avoid becoming a statistic
8497236 thats unheard of were the only state thats done that
8497237 if you have 14 fewer people that didnt die on a motorcycle thats great we need to keep on this these deaths are preventable
8497238 were five ahead of where we were last year and we dont want to be there
8497239 with gas prices going the way they are people are turning to these things
8497240 i just wanted a bike cause all my friends ride

8497242 this is something that ive been wanting to do most of my life
8497243 if someone is serious about riding a motorcycle on the street absolutely they should do this
8497244 meet me in st louie louie meet me at the fair dont tell me the lights are shining any place but there
8497245 laughed at the suggestion and certainly did not call mccain on it

8497249 are you feeling withdrawn like you dont want to be around people
8497250 who would ever want to hurt themselves and of course i want to be around people im a people person what kind of questions are these im sleepy not suicidal
8497251 i like to write about my life on the internet for complete strangers
8497252 well thats probably why youre tired you have a lot going on

8497257 having said that the people were right and he is yet to change but this time without his daughter by his side he has become a public embarrassment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me its obvious who that is
8497258 he has no idea what is going on in my life because i have chosen not to involve him in it his recent attack on my life and my loved ones is simply for an addiction that he has fame
8497259 your fingertips across my skin the palm trees swaying in the wind images you sang me spanish lullabies the sweetest sadness in your eyes id never want to see you unhappy i thought youd want the same for me goodbye my almost lover goodbye my hopeless dream so long my luckless romance my back is turned on you should have known youd bring me heartache almost lovers always do

8497263 that shits going to be on youtube we gotta get that tape
8497264 hes running through traffic dodging cars on peoples hoods as two guards are chasing him
8497265 hes saying please help me please help me with two or three security guards running through traffic trying to catch him
8497266 they were running after him saying thats the guy with the camera
8497267 i cut across and headed that way thinking he will prevent these guys from taking my tape
8497268 i knew that then at least wed be able to get the tape later
8497269 i figured theres no way that the security guards are just going to assault this random dude in front of a cop
8497270 it landed within five feet of me i leaned down to pick it up and i got tackled by two of the dudes they threw me into that ivy covered wall and i was trying to get them off me at one point there were three guards on me i threw the tape to sean and thats when it got really ugly
8497271 he hurled him into it then threw him onto the ground at this point there are two or three officers there
8497272 they beat the shit out of him in front of a cop
8497273 i am not going to give you evidence to help you back up your story

8497291 should we trust john mccains judgment when he says there can be no timelines to draw down our troops from iraq that we must stay indefinitely or should we listen to barack obama who says shift responsibility to the iraqis and set a time to bring our combat troops home
8497292 after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home john mccain was wrong barack obama was right

8497299 today a clear message was sent to the iemma government
8497300 they dont have the support of the population nor do they have the support of the majority of the people inside the parliament and the events that occurred today clearly demonstrate that this government does not have the support to proceed
8497301 over 70 per cent of workers covered by the enterprise agreement choose to be union members yet telstra is not respecting their rights to be represented and to bargain collectively
8497302 telstra has a choice they can cooperate with the ballot and respect their employees democratic wishes or they can utilise the last remnants of work choices to trample on workers rights
8497303 job losses of this size are very bad news for local economies and diminish yet again telstras engagement with regional australia
8497304 the union is just punching at shadows because they know that this is a great offer for our employees
8497305 we are offering eligible employees employee collective agreements that are fair competitive and reflect the terms and conditions our people have told us are important to them

8497352 quedense en su pa s globero y pelotero pinches fariceos traga tortillas
8497353 quedense en su pa s globero y pelotero pinches fariceos traga tortillas
8497354 yeah i mean your dad can even come out too i know he has been to the bar a few times
8497355 my dad i dont talk to my dad you mean rick hes my boyfriend
8497356 why are you asking me about the speech this guy already has given four of the best speeches anyone can remember he doesnt need my help i just want to hear what he comes up with this time
8497357 he needs to talk about the future and whats really at stake not just in november but long term
8497358 especially how were going to get jobs back in this country
8497359 i expect to hear how hes going to address the breakdown in washington the things that have kept us from getting our levees repaired and he has to talk about the way the bush administration has squandered the united states reputation as the great hope of the world
8497360 he can unite the country not just the party because he represents the diversity and unity that we have there
8497361 is how were going to bring the country back so much has happened to people in the last few years and people need to have some hope of a comeback
8497362 he has to reach out to the clinton delegates and embrace them he has to do it himself for the sake of the millions who supported her and who cant be here i expect him to talk about the economy and iraq but first he better talk to us
8497363 he has to say again as he did when he first announced that this election is not about me its really about you and what kind of future you and your family will have its important he speak to independents they are the largest party now in colorado
8497364 our decision to engage was made in the last second as the russian tanks were rolling we had no choice
8497365 we took the initiative just to buy some time we knew we were not going to win against the russian army but we had to do something to defend ourselves
8497366 i got a call from the minister of defense that russian tanks some 200 were massing to enter tskhinvali from north ossetia
8497367 i ignored it at first but reports kept coming in that they had begun to move forward in fact they had mobilized reserves several days ahead of time
8497368 that theyd been called up three days before from places like moscow we had intelligence coming in ahead of time but we just couldnt believe it also in recent weeks the separatists had intensified artillery barrages and were shooting our soldiers id kept telling our guys to stay calm actually we had most of our troops down near abkhazia where we expected the real trouble to start i can tell you that if wed intended to attack wed have withdrawn our best trained forces from iraq up front
8497369 some months ago i was warned by western leaders in dubrovnik to expect an attack this summer
8497370 mr putin had already threatened me in february saying we would become a protectorate of russia when i met mr medvedev in june he was very friendly i saw him again in july and he was a changed man spooked evasive he tried to avoid me he knew something by then i ask everyone to consider what does it mean when hundreds of tanks can mobilize and occupy a country within two days just the fuelling takes that long they were on their way would we provoke a war while all our western friends are away on vacation be sensible
8497371 if america thinks it is too weak to do anything about georgia
8497372 you should understand how the russians see it how much moscow respects a strong united states or at least a u s that believes in its own strength
8497373 the us having backed numerous brutal right wing military dictatorships in central america from the 1960s and 1970s through to the early 1990s

8497385 mit dem geist der einheit und mit dem ziel des sieges lasst uns barack obama einstimmig zum kandidaten erkl ren
8497386 er hat die intelligenz und die neugier die jeder pr sident braucht
8497387 mit joe bidens erfahrung und seiner weisheit mit der er obamas bewiesene instinkte seine einsicht und sein verst ndnis unterst tzen wird hat amerika das sichere f hrungsduo das es braucht
8497388 es ist der job des n chsten pr sidenten den amerikanischen traum wieder aufzubauen und die amerikanische f hrung in der welt wieder herzustellen
8497389 er wird immer zuerst die diplomatie w hlen und erst als letztes mittel die milit rische gewalt
8497390 die zweifel haben 1992 nicht gegriffen und sie werden auch 2008 nicht greifen denn wir sind auf der richtigen seite der geschichte
8497391 on the streets we didnt have any rules maybe one no kicks to the groin home for dinner
8497392 das ist die zeit wenn risikopr mien von 10 bis 15 us dollar pro barrel gerechtfertigt sind
8497393 php now edit templates templatename sidebar tpl to include this line where ever you want the top users to get displayed
8497394 our objective is to make a rapid and substantial improvement to the overall logistics service we provide to our publishers suppliers and customers and at the same time to offer a modern work environment to our employees
8497395 valora will undergo a process of fundamental transformation over the next few years the trajectory along which this will proceed has now been set
8497396 unser ziel ist es insgesamt die bestehenden logistikdienstleistungen f r unsere verleger lieferanten und kunden rasch und erheblich zu verbessern gleichzeitig wollen wir unseren mitarbeitenden ein zeitgerechtes arbeitsumfeld bieten
8497397 die valora gruppe wird in den n chsten jahren grundlegende ver nderungen durchlaufen die weichen dazu sind nun gestellt
8497398 what ive heard consistently from my clients is we just need to know
8497399 there remain a number of differences in the details and the devil is in the details
8497400 having two different standard setting bodies working over time isnt a sustainable model
8497401 for many shareholders the presence of excessive perquisites has become an acid test on governance
8497402 perks have always been a controversial issue paying the taxes on top of the perks has been even more so
8497403 just because there will be kids and everything else well keep them in sealed plastic bags
8497404 they can still pick up the bag and handle them
8497405 with that you get immediate feedback on the interaction between device and tissue
8497406 is to really get people excited about science and medicine and bioengineering
8497407 this is a new platform for learning in the same way a laptop or a desktop was a new platform
8497408 the time is approaching when these little devices will be as much a part of education as a bookbag
8497409 back then it was still a little bit of an exotic item
8497410 now they receive one as a high school graduation gift
8497411 when i first showed them the camera and how easy it was to put a video on youtube they looked like i had just pulled a rabbit out of my hat
8497412 a lot of students watched and we got a lot of feedback from people who were angry about the policy
8497413 a lot of kids told me later they used that video in discussions in other classes
8497414 were excited to bring the magic brand to new platforms and give gamers new ways to experience this great property
8497415 the game successfully brings magics inherent strategic game play to the xbox live community
8497416 we won this game by putting pressure on the real esteli
8497417 from a players perspective we didnt play our best game because i think we were a little bit nervous
8497418 in the first half we played well but in the second half we let the forwards advance lacking concentration we almost allowed a goal which is unacceptable at home the important thing today is the win and we are going to honduras with the desire to win the series
8497419 the marketing and promotion efforts of astrazeneca through its advertisers and sales force overstated the benefits of seroquel and minimized downplayed and concealed the risks associated with this drug
8497420 this is not good i have a family four kids
8497421 those plans were later changed because of very serious reasons
8497422 i dont mean serious as in dire i mean serious as in good business practices
8497423 producers and directors would rather be in the city limits
8497424 its great for the industry we need soundstage space we need a space for all the work thats coming in
8497425 what weve always needed is a big empty soundproof box with high ceilings and now were going to get it
8497426 in an ideal world the production office is right next to the soundstage especially when a film is stage intensive
8497427 we should be getting really busy here pretty quickly were waiting on people to dot their is and cross their ts
8497428 it wouldnt have happened at all without the pennsylvania film tax credit program as an incentive
8497429 we will be hiring quite a few people thats one of the things im most proud of were going to be putting people to work
8497430 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure
8497431 for that reason everyone in the gulf needs to be monitoring the storm
8497432 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario
8497433 we might see oil prices spike us 5 to us 8 if it really rips into platforms
8497434 combined with the deep warm waters rapid intensification could occur in a couple of days
8497435 i dont know how i can live now because none of my family is left
8497436 it has happened before but its not a frequent occurrence
8497437 we continually refine and update our procedures and do our best to protect the systems on the station
8497438 im not going to speculate on how this could have happened
8497439 our expedition 17 crew on the station is working with flight control and engineering teams and with our international partners to identify and eradicate the virus thats on board and well look for any actions we can take to prevent that from happening again
8497440 gamers are the second most targeted group malware authors go after and chances are that any password and account combination thats stolen could be reused on other sites
8497441 needs to look at this as a wake up call and they need to look closely at their policies
8497442 things are not locked down or as tight as they should be
8497443 look at real strong management and real strong policy enforcement
8497444 police will use a softened stance to deal with the protesters
8497445 we will give them time to leave the government house but if they continue to defy the court order then we have to use force to drive them out i cannot set the precise time or deadline for this
8497446 if we get arrested please dont follow us to the detention center
8497447 if the police want to arrest them come here and do so or if they want our leaders to give themselves up that is fine but the government has to resign first
8497448 what area of american international policy would you change immediately as president
8497449 id institute a policy that i call rogue state rollback i would arm train equip both from without and from within forces that would eventually overthrow the governments and install free and democratically elected governments as long as saddam hussein is in power i am convinced that he will pose a threat to our security
8497450 is causing a rift with the american military which contends that any significant diminution of the awakening could result in renewed violence jeopardizing the substantial security gains in the past year
8497451 if it is not handled properly we could have a security issue
8497452 how honest are we if we tell the truth most of the time and stay silent only when telling the truth might get us fired or earn us a broken nose we need moral courage to be honest all the time
8497453 i dont know that people in missouri are going to like seeing tens of thousands of europeans screaming for the one
8497454 prominent republicans have been for the first time openly critical
8497455 what happened inside the bush white house and washingtons culture of deception
8497456 a historic if incomplete triumph or a depressing reminder of why few women pursue high office in the first place
8497457 pigs at the trough how corporate greed and political corruption are undermining america
8497458 fanatics and fools the game plan for winning back america
8497459 we struck a deal with the huckabee people they came to us and dealt with us honorably and with respect and so we told them that if dr paul didnt make it through the first round that we would go for their man they pledged us three delegates to the republican national convention
8497460 a change of environment is the traditional fallacy upon which doomed loves and lungs reside
8497461 if he turned any more cheeks hed have to pull down his pants
8497462 civilized men are more discourteous than savages because they know they can be impolite without having their skulls split as a general thing
8497463 if he turned any more cheeks hed have to pull down his pants
8497464 your attack has been rendered harmless it is however quite pretty
8497465 i had no idea where the money to pay for all this was going to come from but i knew that this project had to be done and so i put my trust in the universe
8497466 we have to find ways to market bellevue in different ways
8497467 now we shut down around 5 p m we have no nightlife but if we can turn the community into a destination this town could be hopping on weekends and evenings
8497468 another pizzeria is not going to bring newcomers to bellevue
8497469 destination stores and restaurants will attract young residents and out of towners
8497470 i too would like to see a more diverse shopping district
8497471 it would be good to see a mens clothing store again and a couple more restaurants
8497472 the cost of rent is less than in the city
8497473 it was a good way to introduce wine to a dry town
8497474 bellevue is in a perfect location to draw young people its right on port authority bus lines and its only a few minutes from downtown but if you want to attract young people to live here you must give them something to do in their town including having a drink with their meals
8497475 ive seen a lot more changes in the past seven months we have a proactive council that has a vision for the future
8497476 you can get good prices on big homes within walking distance of our business district
8497477 lot of people like to go out and eat and have a glass of wine id rather see them stay in bellevue more diners equals more shoppers and more potential home buyers
8497478 my personal opinion i see nothing wrong with restaurants serving wine
8497479 but what happens will depend on what the majority of borough residents want to do if it gets on the ballot the question will be decided by the voters
8497480 when a store becomes vacant it usually stays empty only for a little while and then a new business will come in
8497481 restaurants would do better but i think allowing sales by the drink could put us on a slippery slope
8497482 i see the potential for an increase in police calls
8497483 anyway many of us dont decide on where to go for dinner based on whether the restaurant serves alcohol
8497484 i like to donate the money because it will help make my brother happy
8497485 you can tell that raeann really loves and cares about her brother
8497486 shes constantly ahead of him knowing what he wants she is a kind hearted little girl
8497487 people know that the bracelets are for a good cause and they appeal to a lot of people who can personally relate to them
8497488 raeann can make them by request too and you usually have them the next day thats how quick she is
8497489 i have remembrance bracelets autism ones and i have bought birthstone bracelets for my daughters
8497490 there are even quite a few that i have given as gifts
8497491 its nice to have something like this all of her bracelets are displayed here with little cards saying what each bracelet is explaining the meanings of the colored beads
8497492 we feel fairly fortunate that our supplier did give us a bona fide bid
8497493 last year this particular area wasnt that bad we only had about three weeks of really bad weather the midwest however got hit hard
8497494 we are stuck between a rock and a hard place
8497495 its going to be a give and take this year
8497496 we will just have to be as conservative as we can on the flat streets while making sure our people are safe
8497497 were contemplating that as a decision we may have to make
8497498 its almost obscene compared to what these other communities are seeing
8497499 ive warned my municipalities and the board that this is something they have to plan for in the future
8497500 the impact is going to be felt on budgets deferred maintenance and maybe even tax increases
8497501 in general people in western pennsylvania are used to seeing black asphalt when it snows i think with these costs municipalities are going to have to start prioritizing and there has to be some understanding by the public
8497502 the days of seeing rock salt at 40 a ton are probably in the past
8497503 euroncap cree que los consumidores est n interesados en la seguridad ofrecida a todos los ocupantes cuando eligen el modelo que van a comprar por esta raz n el organismo esta desarrollando un nuevo sistema de puntuaci n que tendr en cuenta la seguridad total del veh culo
8497504 unser ziel ist es insgesamt die bestehenden logistikdienstleistungen f r unsere verleger lieferanten und kunden rasch und erheblich zu verbessern gleichzeitig wollen wir unseren mitarbeitenden ein zeitgerechtes arbeitsumfeld bieten
8497505 die valora gruppe wird in den n chsten jahren grundlegende ver nderungen durchlaufen die weichen dazu sind nun gestellt

8497507 there is a fake couple in the house who is it
8497508 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8497509 a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need will deliver that change
8497510 as we gather here tonight our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8497511 the bush foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8497512 now after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home
8497513 im here to warm up the crowd for joe biden though as you will soon see he doesnt need any help from me
8497514 he drew the distinction on the war and other issues
8497515 hes going to go out and take the offensive after all this pounding that obama has taken
8497516 he was genuine passionate articulate did not say too much and really did what he had to do
8497517 i watched how he touched people how he inspired them and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear
8497518 when i got knocked down by guys bigger than me she sent me back out and demanded that i bloody their nose so i could walk down that street the next day
8497519 wenn chuck norris liegest tze macht dr ckt er nicht sich nach oben sondern die welt nach unten
8497520 manche leute tragen superman schlafanz ge superman tr gt chuck norris schlafanz ge
8497521 they understand theyre going to be held to a higher standard
8497522 its a sad day when any officer breaks their oath to serve with integrity
8497523 this case is a reminder to all that no one is above the law
8497524 if you find yourself on the wrong road dont just keep on going until youre in over your head back up and start over on the right road
8497525 if youre happy and you know it clap your hands
8497526 have been based in whole or in part on the worlds addiction to oil
8497527 if we continue to follow this slippery oil slicked downward winding path our citizens will shiver in darkness as our resources hemorrhage to third world thugs whose only virtue is their control of petroleum based energy
8497528 and indeed for the past eight years have filled both offices at once
8497529 for the past eight years the man in the oval office has tipped his hat over his eyes kicked back his chair and snoozed at his desk
8497530 charged with protecting our national interests he slept on duty while his vice president conspired with oil industry cronies tasked with cutting off funding to terrorists he slept on duty while oil shortages worsened oil prices soared and dollars by the ton were delivered to terrorists banks in iran saudi arabia and venezuela
8497531 faced with a new kind of war this president and his vice president helped their friends the old fashioned way through war profiteering tax cuts for billionaires and in many cases out and out corruption
8497532 comprehensive and based on sound science and sound policies science we know will work
8497533 for over a quarter of a century the republicans have sold their magic beans with a promise of a giant beanstalk and gold over the horizon
8497534 it is time to bring our nation back to reality it is time for an energy policy that recognizes national security means ending dependence on oil and that the future is about new ideas and change for the better not snake oil and quackery

8497539 on a un peu de mal comprendre cette valorisation boursi re
8497540 i love this you know i do but we have important work to do here tonight
8497541 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8497542 most important barack obama knows america cannot be strong abroad unless we are first strong at home people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8497543 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8497544 i know the tingling is gone which is really a good sign
8497545 the one thing well continue to do is monitor everyday and always reserve the right to do whats in his best interests and ours
8497546 the one thing we dont want him to do and weve told him this about 100 times is pitch with any kind of concern in his head weve kind of beat him over the head with that i had him back in my office again today and we did that again
8497547 were not talking about ending the year were talking about ending a career
8497548 any time youre dealing with a pitchers arm i can appreciate them doing that some organizations in this position would do whatever they could to get the player out there and if he says hes ok then ok
8497549 im not a 40 year old man who might be at the end of his days i dont want the blame to come back on them with people saying oh he could have pitched a lot longer if the red sox didnt ask him to do this i dont want to do that
8497550 that error you made tuesday night was that the first of your big league career
8497551 im a young player and im still learning about what pitches i can handle and drive
8497552 as i continue to get experience i look for certain pitches certain counts and sometimes take a chance and try to drive it
8497553 i dont think any of us knows how many of them hes going to hit or where hell be he has the ability to swing hard and square up the ball weve known that for a long time
8497554 he competes real hard and he doesnt give at bats away he got a pitch he can handle and he hit it good
8497555 thats a big part of the yard but i hit it good its exciting its a huge win for us that means we won all three of the road series on this trip now we just have to come out today and win one more
8497556 the ambassador outlined the russian federations position on recent developments in georgia
8497557 mr smith stated that australia respects the territorial integrity of georgia and believes that russia should abide by ceasefire arrangements and return to the positions they occupied before the conflict began
8497558 the previous council they really didnt engage with the state government and quite frankly they didnt report the situation
8497559 i think cloncurry has really struggled to look after its assets in the past
8497560 but that is well and truly behind us now everyone is working really hard on this issue to find a way to resolve it
8497561 at 400 000 a month obviously not going to be forever
8497562 a bigger solution still has to be found because the town cannot be left without water
8497563 there are sites that youve visited that you didnt know had a line of sight on you
8497564 this is the only way to make sure sites dont get information about you
8497565 die menschliche natur richtet sich mit ihrem begehren gegen den geist gottes und der geist gottes richtet sich mit seinem begehren gegen die menschliche natur die beiden liegen im streit miteinander und jede seite will verhindern dass ihr das tut wozu die andere seite euch dr ngt
8497566 wenn ihr den neigungen eurer s ndigen natur folgt wird euer leben die entsprechenden folgen zeigen unzucht unreine gedanken vergn gungssucht g tzendienst zauberei feindschaften streit eifersucht zorn selbsts chtiger ehrgeiz spaltungen selbstgerechte abgrenzung gegen andere gruppen neid trunkenheit ausschweifender lebenswandel und dergleichen mehr
8497567 i used to be a sci fi fan then i started living it
8497568 im impressed but i have to agree with the others dip into your savings and buy some decent noodles i lived off of top ramen while i was in college and im not in a hurry to revisit those noodles again ever
8497569 not to fuss but instead of a quadrennial party celebration certainly there must be a few people like me pointedly asking why the 110th congress accomplished virtually nothing least of all repairing the heinour damage wrought by bush43 and his cronies
8497570 my daughter told me in no uncertain terms that there was to be no more kozy shack pudding in her lunchbox i felt ashamed for having purchased and implemented this pudding without having taste tested it first
8497571 would serve no more than another three years and three months in prison not accounting for credit for good behavior awarded by the bureau of prisons
8497572 has exposed significant misconduct by others in and out of public office and revealed to law enforcement officials and the public the manner and means used by government officials to game the system for private advantage in violation of criminal regulatory and ethical laws and rules
8497573 is appropriate given abramoffs extraordinary cooperation to date cooperation which can be wholly or partially credited for the convictions of a member of congress five high level legislative branch officials one high level executive branch official and two other mid to low level public officials as well as ongoing matters
8497574 good faith belief may established by among other things the reliance upon the advice of experts
8497575 the psychological impact of a course of conduct must be assessed with reference to the subjects psychological history and current mental health status the healthier the individual the less likely that the use of any one procedure or set of precedures as a course of conduct will result in prolonged mental harm
8497576 the state being involved in this case makes a lot of sense
8497577 imagine someones suprise when their mouse starts snoring when not being used
8497578 we have grown into a bedroom community and we continue to see new businesses and buildings coming up in places that used to be abandoned buildings
8497579 i see much of the life i knew when i was growing up here
8497580 i see kennywood where i played as a child and the steel mill where i worked for many years
8497581 the statue was taken down melted to use the steel during world war ii
8497582 we always want to put much of the communitys history into the portrait
8497583 our goal is to inspire young artists to believe in themselves enough to pursue their artistic skills
8497584 my administration was immediately interested in mr holbrooks project when he proposed it last year because he looked at a bunch of young people and instead of seeing problems he saw their potential and he chose to invest in them
8497585 an assisting tool for teaching image amp video compression techniques
8497586 un incremento de las lluvias que ser n fuertes en las provincias orientales en especial en las zonas monta osas y la costa sur con riesgo de inundaciones y desprendimientos de tierra
8497587 se mantendr n las fuertes marejadas en ambas costas orientales con posibles inundaciones en la ciudad norte a de baracoa
8497588 we have no education we have nothing our hope for the future is our children we want them to go to school and learn
8497589 for three months all of the men in the village worked together on the water system not a single one of us left to work outside the village agros paid for the materials they also paid us half of what we would normally have earned working for other people so that we could afford the time to work on the water project now we have running water to all our houses
8497590 when we first come to a community the people are hoping we will just give them what they need we don t do that it would be much easier but it wouldn t work people value what they work for we work alongside communities its a 7 10 year commitment to help a village out of poverty and build social and economic wealth we teach them how to work together everyone has to get involved both the men and the women if they wont work together then we cant work with them

8497598 the fact that we need to be consistent is the most important thing
8497599 were still coming out trying to fly to the ball and hit people
8497600 thats the type of identity that shafe brought to us and we kind of emulated on the field i dont think weve lost a step in that respect
8497601 we always want people to feel like they have their moneys worth when they come and watch our team play a team that runs a team that hits a team that plays together
8497602 i feel like this is a better team than we had last year
8497603 so many signs are there hopefully that translates into more wins but thats why you go play the games to find out
8497604 hey watch me say somethin funny im gonna act cool

8497614 we didnt properly prepare ourselves so it took much longer for us to mesh with the community
8497615 educational allowances are great since she can now pursue areas of study she couldnt before

8497620 i dont know if well be able to contain ourselves when he speaks thursday night added jackson lee 58
8497621 she is besides herself she is a daughter of the south who never had the opportunities that her own daughter had
8497622 as a matter of fact it wasnt until iowa that it became a reality to me
8497623 im still skeptical hell become president because this is america and race is still a major component
8497624 obama has to make it clear that quality ought to be the basis on which people are elected and that color is secondary
8497625 its one thing to be excited and to celebrate and another thing to be engaged and make the big effort
8497626 at the 2004 convention after baracks keynote speech i said to someone that hed be the next nominee
8497627 when can win in iowa or other states he has won in i think it is a tremendous testimony to how far weve come but believe me as an african american and as a woman i know how hard it is
8497628 to think that 40 years later we are nominating the first african american for president of the united states in many ways tells me all the difficulties this country went through in really trying to make all people equal was worthwhile
8497629 it breaches social and legal standards to get its way
8497630 my dads not an idiot hes nothing short of a genius he does have huge flaws and were trying to really paint an honest picture of that i think the osbournes to a degree tarnished the publics perception of my dad as a bit of a senile funny bumbling guy
8497631 at the moment theres no concrete information about the kidnappers were now studying several sources including background information
8497632 maybe the kidnappers after being cornered by villagers thought it would be difficult to escape and killed ito probably by shooting him several times
8497633 our activities have never created animosity among the local people and there was no trouble i dont think it was politically motivated either it was probably just a simple robbery
8497634 aku sedang berada di lokasi pembuatan film suatu pagi dan menembakkan senjata otomatis lalu kru berkata kau harus berhenti menembak kudeta militer akan segera terjadi
8497635 aku bahkan tidak tahu apa artinya itu kapan terakhir kali ada kudeta militer di amerika
8497636 aku terus memikirkan anak dan istriku yang ada di hotel jadi aku meninggalkan lokasi membangunkan mereka dan membawa mereka ke bandara
8497637 aku meninggalkan keluargaku di bandara kembali ke bangkok dan pergi ke lokasi pembuatan film tanpa mempedulikan kalau aku akan kembali ke tengah baku tembak aku harus menyelesaikan film itu banyak tank di jalanan itu merupakan pengalaman yang menakutkan
8497638 for me i mean the respect of your peers is ultimately what you play the game for and really nothing else
8497639 theres no accolades that im chasing at this point other than to be on a winning club and to play in a world series
8497640 that was a chance to add a bat at the right position at a very low cost and a chance to add depth that we might need
8497641 j d s injury necessitated this trade that said were really happy to have mark as a red sox
8497642 they return 4 of 5 starters on the offensive line and their quarterback nate davis seems to be a little bit of a magician
8497643 plus their wide receiver caught a bunch of balls last year so theyre pretty skilled offensively they seem to have graduated some people but defensively all their big producers are all back
8497644 i think were ok in the offensive line but i dont think we want another injury there but again that usually that means someone will have to step up
8497645 yeah i never really knew how much i weighed when i was back in high school
8497646 i didnt know i was going to have a chance to jump in so fast i thought it was going to be a little slower i was coming from defense to offense and i thought it was going to take a year or so to learn the offense but i guess when i jumped in thats when my learning process started
8497647 i guess it happened fast but i think its a good change for me i think i fit into the offense really well
8497648 he had a plan and stuck to it thats a credit to him and strength coach jason loscalzo for working with him and i remember that his numbers in the weight room just skyrocketed as he began to lose weight he got much stronger and just got in overall better shape hes a much better athlete than he was
8497649 i had to change the way i was eating and just take care of my body it wasnt healthy for me to be that size so i had to lose the weight i was more injury prone because i was bigger and i wasnt healing well because i was carrying so much weight around im feeling a lot better now
8497650 weve got a lot of leaner guys and then weve got claiborne in there
8497651 hes kind of a bowling ball who moves people off the line really well hes really good for the running game especially a guy like him is lower to the ground and real powerful im excited to see him move some people come saturday
8497652 ive just been doing photographs for the european tour for the last hour
8497653 the trophies are somewhere driving around here at the moment
8497654 i play with an awful lot of intensity it takes a lot out of me in any given week and i do put a lot in
8497655 you know i get quite an adrenaline rush out of winning tournaments so there is a little bit of a lull afterward
8497656 i have to realize this situation and ive worked my way through it
8497657 years ago i probably would have been frustrated by it but now ive come to realize this is the natural reaction of winning and while you try and counter it you dont try and fight it youve got to go with it
8497658 the game was fine last week i made a few mental errors at times and it caught up to me
8497659 it wasnt far away from being good i just hope i dont make the same mental errors this week but theres nothing ive got to find in my golf swing or anything like that
8497660 the training camp experience has been very interesting a little bit harder than i thought it was going to be
8497661 but at the end of the day once youve survived its not that bad
8497662 the amount of effort you have to put into it
8497663 coming from college everythings a lot faster i was telling some of my college teammates a college game is like an nfl practice in terms of effort and what you have to do its crazy youre going against guys that are bigger stronger faster that can play
8497664 in college youre going to come across people that shouldnt be there theyre just filling a spot thats not the nfl
8497665 its been a lot harder a lot rougher on the body than i thought it was going to be and in terms of digesting the playbook all the plays youve got to learn its no joke
8497666 i dont know what to say about it because i havent experienced it yet well see whos here and whos not here i just want to make sure im here
8497667 as captain of this team and as a member of this team for the past nine years its been exciting to be a part of all the victories and the championships
8497668 i know all the players and coaches are excited for this season and id be at the top of the list
8497669 one of the reasons why we werent able to get over that 7 4 hump the last two years was because we didnt sustain the same level of play throughout the season thats the step that were going to have to take this year
8497670 i think thats going to come with maturity experience and obviously with the talent level we have but i think we have to put it all together if we want to take that next step
8497671 the nice thing is now were actually capable of doing that i was hoping a few years ago we could do that but im not so sure we were good enough we had some good individual players but i think we have enough talent across the board now to reach those goals
8497672 ive got the phone with me all the time im just waiting
8497673 it was brutal i couldnt play during a time of the summer i usually play well i really havent played any golf in six weeks with the exception of last week so i dont have much in the way of expectations
8497674 he finished fourth in one of the events and just finished 16th in an open event so hes had a very solid summer hes played in a lot of the national stuff for a number of years im proud of him
8497675 its nice to be back last year i didnt play the tour
8497676 its just nice to come back and play this year has been pretty good
8497677 to be as simple as possible i just want to play football
8497678 thats what it comes down to i know whats on the table i know whats on the line i put a lot of work in this and i want to play
8497679 just wasnt a time frame on that my knee still looks pretty good the decision was left up to me to play if you give a football player a decision to play you know im going to play
8497680 is the direct result of big oil and their cronies like scott garrett blocking sound energy policy for years
8497681 i think its good to have a strengthened relationship with the pacific neighbors there already is some cooperation but now we want to build on this more and more i suppose this is simply what one calls globalization this means more cooperation and a greater involvement of our overseas territories in their regional environment
8497682 we really need to get the message across in particular in are in essence because you just cant take it for granted and i suppose the best way of achieving this would be to have members of parliament personalities of french polynesia and i think its really important to create a regular movement of such visits so those territories can explain in their own words what they are what they want and how they intend to develop themselves
8497683 theres no reason i cant be the change i want to see in the world
8497684 when it rains their drinking water looks like chocolate milk
8497685 this isnt nuclear science here we can clean up dirty water
8497686 people would walk two or three hours to come knock on my door
8497687 at that point they make me stand up and give a speech which i wasnt ready for
8497688 just let me live til voting time in november in my lifetime we just might get to see the first african american president
8497689 the part of the machine thats running the motor right now
8497690 if you have to permit on the fly its not preferred
8497691 were here to assist you in facilitating your first amendment rights follow us please
8497692 so what well do is well just go ahead and make some allowances
8497693 he brings a great approach from front to back he sees all 11 guys thats what i think as a defensive coordinator your responsibility is
8497694 mikes very no nonsense and theyve responded well to that
8497695 its a hard playing group its just that they havent been consistent
8497696 the real positive i found when i first got here is all these guys are good guys who want to win
8497697 marvin re enforced some things swarm to the ball pad level footwork
8497698 mike cut his teeth as a secondary coach so technically in the back end weve improved tremendously
8497699 we already had some talented guys now you see it happening on the practice field
8497700 were not were more in your face more man zone blitz
8497701 you just have confidence that theyre going to make people have to go 80 90 yards and not give up 60 yard chunks
8497702 when were healthy we have as much talent as anybody needs to get to the super bowl
8497703 nobody expects much out of us and thats a good thing its just the opposite of cleveland where everybody expects them to be good
8497704 august 4th pryor gets to start practicing hes going to be incorporated into our offense that day hes got a lot of things that hes got to build as a foundation hes got great ability so i would think that from day one hell be a guy that youre going to take notice of
8497705 there are high expectations but those things are based off the premise of what weve done in the past as well the 17 starters that we have coming back the preseason publications are great but i like the postseason publications better
8497706 when we can take a freshman class and go through all four years and win consistently then i think you can say that youve turned the corner
8497707 i obviously get tired of answering the same question when are you going to retire when i dont know and i dont know what to say so many times id like to retire when i feel as if i cannot make a contribution to penn state
8497708 michigan man running things change is sweeping through michigan traditions the transition likely will take time on offense so a defense that returns all four starters on the line needs to get tough
8497709 everybody has an opportunity in this conference how we play down the stretch will be important we lost some games last year in the closing minutes we lost one double overtime game we lost a couple games where we had the lead so we have to finish games at the end
8497710 we were able to bring the purdue program from the depths to being very competitive
8497711 were not satisfied with six wins ive said this a lot back in 1993 when i arrived back on campus at northwestern if we would have had six wins we would have had a parade down central street shut it down and had a purple party
8497712 we have a rare combination we still have a relatively young football team this year we also have a very experienced football team in a lot of ways so were really optimistic about the way things are going to shake out
8497713 were coming off our first winning season first bowl experience in a number of years we feel like we have some confidence on campus i think our guys are really looking forward to the season
8497714 j tais tr s amoureuse de cet endroit quand j tais adolescente jy ai m me travaill pendant les vacances
8497715 with icarus quill and ink from the blood of nameless things
8497716 weve discussed this just because your bedrooms smaller doesnt mean its haunted
8497717 thats not why small usually equals cozy but the atmosphere feels for lack of anything better off somehow
8497718 hear no voice but our crying smell only your fear write us down
8497719 in this free fall that is my life will i be left again
8497720 the atmosphere is moist and daytime heating and the warm front will set off showers and possible severe weather
8497721 it should be a little bit more tame on friday
8497722 weve averaged around 3 to 4 inches of rain since this started and fortunately it started out with a good soaking rain and a lot of this has gone into the ground
8497723 they were nice they gave us our breakfast for free
8497724 it seemed like the higher areas of the county got more
8497725 the county averaged two and a half to three inches of rain
8497726 it has gotten less organized inland but it is still an area of low pressure
8497727 its too early to tell what effect it will have on the early varieties it will help the later varieties
8497728 we did have a tornado warning tuesday but that expired quickly the rain fall has come at a pace that has either been able to run off or be absorbed
8497729 thats what he is there for and it is good that he is there for us hes been through it he knows things
8497730 the way ive been hitting lately is not acceptable by my standards because i expect a lot out of myself no matter how old i am or how long ive been here i have a certain standard to perform lately i havent been doing it and yes its embarrassing
8497731 every day you start over make the best of it and learn from it this is probably one of a million slumps ill go through and dealing with adversity is all part of it thats the positive side of it for me everybody struggles
8497732 players know people want to see them play and usually they bear down and do better all those people probably never saw jay struggle as a kid
8497733 i know i have to be aggressive but be aggressive in the strike zone these pitchers know they dont have to throw me a strike so they wont why should they i wouldnt either if i didnt have to
8497734 this is all a learning process and i need to shorten that process as quickly as i can
8497735 i havent struck out seven straight times in my life ever in your whole life you are always experiencing first times and hopefully thats the last time i experience that
8497736 i was going up there more trying not to strike out than get a hit
8497737 thats a bad approach thats like playing not to lose rather than playing to win thats over
8497738 he struck out 10 didnt walk anybody and gave up only three runs and seven hits
8497739 ill meet with gm walt jocketty when we get back tonight
8497740 that makes for not throwing in the towel for us playing as if it us contending
8497741 it is better to play contending teams than teams out of it you still have to play its your job
8497742 i dont care if youre playing a game in your backyard you play the game right and you play to win
8497743 i dont really think about the record going into the games
8497744 i just try to remember what ive done to them in games past and how i got different guys out stick with the game plan and execute it until they try to do something else
8497745 you know hes going to pitch a good game and put up a lot of zeros
8497746 hes one of the premier pitchers in the league so i knew i couldnt make a mistake
8497747 roy and two big swings are all we needed tonight
8497748 i dont know if it was the first inning going a bunch of pitches right out of the chute
8497749 i kind of ran down a little bit i thought maybe i could get through the eighth but that was pushing it
8497750 maybe in new york i went out of the zone for some fastballs
8497751 but i feel just as good as i did the prior week
8497752 the makeup of the guys in this clubhouse is that they can have a 10 game losing streak and put it all behind them
8497753 i thought fausto got better as the game wore on
8497754 i felt the best that i have all year tonight i had good stuff
8497755 its funny i had nothing in kansas city in my last start and won and tonight i lost
8497756 im pleased with the way their guys fought through things with all the adversity and trades and things
8497757 what kind of photos are better in b amp w
8497758 i personally think its too close to some residences and some commercial areas and they have a history of a spill
8497759 tom is a good guy but after 18 years i think it was time to move in another direction
8497760 he knows the players and he knows the township issues i didnt want us to lose a guy like that
8497761 after 18 years of service we should have offered him a settlement and allowed him to leave with dignity not give him the ax while hes on vacation
8497762 this is not good i have a family four kids
8497763 you expect things to be expensive when youre on vacation said mr
8497764 why would you go out there when its eating up your gas
8497765 i told them lets save the money and have a cook out in the back yard
8497766 weve been on a roller coaster for the past few years
8497767 hopefully we are looking at a baseline now and we will start moving in one direction up
8497768 its hard to believe how much happens in one day here
8497769 it took a little government intervention to make that happen
8497770 i think it was the right move at the right time
8497771 its a destination spot where people will want to come to
8497772 we dont want to have traffic backing up on the interstate

8497804 when i was getting at bats against lefties i was trying to take advantage of them by seeing a lot of pitches so i thought seeing a lot of pitches would help me get out of it
8497805 but manager ron gardenhire told me be more aggressive jump on the first good pitch i took that approach today and it worked
8497806 we knew jimenez was up earlier but we didnt see him then then riggleman comes walking out and i went hey hes up no one saw him
8497807 i was like just finally finally i know i can hit lefties they know i can hit lefties

8497822 the analogy to his own time 16 years ago in office there couldnt be a more thorough and complete transition to the cq election map
8497823 obama and chief strategist david axelrod are clearly aware of what past campaigns did right and what they did wrong
8497824 there were lessons we really learned from howard deans primary
8497825 you cant just have this internet presence it has to be real on the ground
8497826 it was a genuinely difficult moment in the campaign for them and him and he did a risky thing gave an extremely well received speech and came out of it stronger if anything
8497827 he did exactly what he was told except it was the wrong holiday inn and the wrong van
8497828 that is the most amazing criminal heist that anyone has ever done
8497829 the conclusion i came to was its an inside job
8497830 he said i dont know they just asked me to pick up this van
8497831 ive had a lot of crazy things happen in our vans i dont know that this is even the craziest thing thats happened in our vans this is the funnest thing
8497832 all of a sudden he simply says to me no
8497833 said curry a former georgia tech football coach now at georgia state
8497834 no 2 if i come to georgia tech will you help me become a football coach
8497835 you would have had to consider us a long shot
8497836 he really had to want to be a part of building something great
8497837 at the end of the day youre going to know youre getting our best there has to be trust from a player and there has to be respect for the coach
8497838 he can get in your face and scowl at you a little bit other times hes a fun guy you see every day smiling and making jokes
8497839 coach roof has come in and brought a lot of confidence to our defense making things simplified for us to go out there and make plays hes one of those guys who has been in that situation before where a team has been down we believe in him and he believes in us
8497840 he was also a great player so when he gives you advice you really listen
8497841 i had good players around me that when i grabbed a piece of string to hang on they would get there quick so i wouldnt miss
8497842 i only knew him at northwestern when we played duke two or three times
8497843 i used to kid him when he first got here when we started competing a little bit in the spring about how much he blitzed guess what he still does
8497844 we did it fairly quick at duke because we were very fortunate to have some guys that made plays they were in position to make
8497845 as far as getting into talking about how good the gophers defense will be thats too far down the road we just need to be in the now because that picture gets too big for kids our picture needs to be very small
8497846 there will be some people who will be profoundly inconvenienced
8497847 weve worked very hard to minimize the impact as much as possible

8497852 take him yourselves and crucify him i found no case against him
8497853 take him yourselves and crucify him i found no case against him
8497854 just as there were many who were astonished at him so marred was his appearance beyond human semblance so he shall startle many nations
8497855 i dont see anything wrong with this guy we smacked him around a little bit here he is all banged up are you happy now
8497856 their laws the laws of the jews were nearly trodden under foot
8497857 i think clinton really covered some ground that hillary left open which was unconditional support of barack
8497858 the entire time hes held back tonight he went all out
8497859 he needed to do that and he did it with pure class and style he went to the point of embracing barack obama
8497860 he said it enough times i think it was hard for him to get to this point
8497861 he reminded people lets not get caught up in the emotion weve got a lot of work to do
8497862 certainly living in london i get an earful every day about how america is not what it was there were discourses on foreign policy defence dealing with our neighbours as citizens of the world
8497863 i was not convinced that biden was the person who shouldve been running with obama because our states governor bill richardson was
8497864 particularly because he raised his children on his own i got an entirely different picture of him than this strong white male
8497865 biden has an outstanding story its very admirable how he raised his children
8497866 tidak dapat berkompromi dengan kenyataan berbau diskriminasi perkauman yang dikeluarkan oleh ahli ahli politik yang tidak bertanggungjawab
8497867 walaupun tema bagi perayaan kemerdekaan ke 51 adalah perpaduan teras kejayaan namun kenyataan ahmad sedemikian tidak dapat memupuk semangat perpaduan nasional malah akan menjerumuskan hubungan perkauman yang sedia ada

8497869 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8497870 i think he has done pretty well so far what do you think
8497871 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8497872 now despite being complicit in this catastrophic foreign policy john mccain says barack obama isnt ready to protect our national security
8497873 now let me ask you whose judgment should we trust should we trust john mccain
8497874 i really thought things were going to get tense but in the end it was all so emotional holding hands and cheering and dancing to love train
8497875 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8497876 ghost towns of 2100 just goes to show how much forbes has forgotten their recent history
8497877 some might argue that city dwellers will survive and rebuild although the fate of new orleans in the wake of hurricane katrina which flooded 80 of the city in 2005 offers mixed lessons
8497878 researchers at the university of california davis forecast a 75 chance that san francisco will be struck by a major earthquake of magnitude 7 or above by 2086
8497879 i try not to speculate and think about that too much i just try to keep my head clear and concentrate on practice ive been going hard at it during exhibition games on special teams it hasnt been mistake free but im just trying to go hard and get better every chance i get
8497880 i think physically im up to speed with the other guys
8497881 i can match the defensive backs its just that from a technical point of view theres a lot of work i have to do things like the way i run my routes also we run a lot of no huddle where we try to see what the defence is doing and adjust a lot of the routes i run will change depending on the defence thats something ive never had to do before
8497882 we had lunch and i told him you look like a cow on the side of the road and youre giving that impression youve got to play through that
8497883 but hes shown his athletic ability and speed and i think hes got a chance
8497884 the whole thing when he went down there is he can catch the ball jump and i mean jump with a 42 inch vertical jump and run
8497885 and hes not a pipsqueak so thats given him a head start you look at federkeil whos now coming into his own and you see it takes some time to learn
8497886 ha pasado un a o y no est paco a medida que pasa el tiempo yo noto m s su p rdida al principio estaba un poco agotada de cuidarle y atenderle me hab a quedado algo delgada mientras me recuper no pude pensar en la tragedia tengo la sensaci n de que va a venir de que va a entrar de un momento a otro no puedo hacerme a la idea de que no est

8497888 s pero siguiendo a la liebre me he escapado del pelot n ahora s lo me queda igualar su r cord
8497889 yo creo que nadie ha llenado hasta ahora su espacio umbral ten a virtudes y defectos y una de sus virtudes era la de ser inconfundible era un escritor con un estilo tan propio que solamente imit ndolo puede ser reproducido pero quien imita nunca es buen escritor
8497890 su hueco no se ha llenado y probablemente nadie lo llenar nunca nadie ha llenado el hueco de pla de camba y de larra
8497891 la columna de paco es dif cil de sustituir a m me gusta mucho leer a los columnistas y hay algunos que se leen bien y otros muy bien pero la verdad es que hoy no hay una columna como la que escrib a paco
8497892 es muy dif cil que vuelva a haber un columnista como los que paco le a cuando empez ahora la gente pone menos cuidado en la escritura pero todos sabemos qui nes son los columnistas que escriben bien
8497893 su inocencia infantil y su deslumbrante ingenio que seg n cela era tambi n su lastre
8497894 yo creo que la literatura es algo que se hace con palabras pero que deben tener un contenido las palabras sin contenido se convierten en una osamenta umbral es un maestro de la palabra pero la palabra es condici n necesaria aunque no suficiente para pasar a la posteridad
8497895 de umbral quedar mortal y rosa eso lo sabemos todos y r fagas de alta literatura disparadas por aqu y por all hay una obra en la que nadie ha reparado y que a m me parece la mejor de las suyas los cuadernos de luis vives ah umbral raya la altura del retrato del artista adolescente de joyce o el retrato del artista cachorro de dylan thomas
8497896 paco escrib a mucho para mucha gente era un poco abrumador era m s f cil leer la columna diaria ya que lectores de libros hay menos que de peri dicos mucha gente se permite juzgar sin haber le do todos los libros de paco hay algunos un poco ocasionales pero hay otros que ha escrito concienzudamente poniendo mucho amor y mucho arte

8497949 for us africa still has a huge amount of promise
8497950 there are still things we want to do with the african setting and i think its safe to say well continue to explore it
8497951 we might find something new and compelling about the antarctic setting that wants us to make the next game there
8497952 if we wanted to make the next game set in the forest of south america we could do it
8497953 but i think to save time for us one of the reasons we chose to use the african setting is because we felt that in order to retain the far cry brand value of an exotic dangerous environment a place that maybe people havent had a chance to see themselves or have seen extensively in film television and other games we wanted to choose africa

8497983 its great for the industry we need soundstage space we need a space for all the work thats coming in
8497984 what weve always needed is a big empty soundproof box with high ceilings and now were going to get it
8497985 in an ideal world the production office is right next to the soundstage especially when a film is stage intensive

8497989 how we think about downtowns has changed completely since 1997
8497990 groups like the riverlife task force and the green building alliance werent even around back then
8497991 theres a lot of people interested in doing stuff downtown we sense there could be a clearer direction we did the stadiums what is the next big idea for downtown as a community it seems to me that we should have a say in that
8497992 could downtown pittsburgh as a downtown be a leed certified place
8497993 does that make us more competitive for investment both within the region but really more nationally that would be a tremendous thing if we could do it
8497994 its really a small thing but talk to somebody who just spent 250 000 to move downtown and all of the sudden the contractor can start at 5 a m thats a problem
8497995 if we want to get investment both public and private a downtown plan is a cost of doing business
8497996 there was concern and we will definitely work with the parents a little bit but basically hes under arrest
8497997 this situation is so difficult and theyre just making it worse

8497999 shall the county enact an ordinance to increase real estate taxes in order to repeal the alcoholic drink tax
8498000 it is not surprising to anyone who has observed county chief executive dan onoratos administrations procedural gymnastics that the administration has apparently commissioned a political statement instead of a legal analysis
8498001 this latest effort to disenfranchise the voters is an insult to the thousands of voters who signed the petitions and everyone who is entitled to vote on the drink tax

8498018 what its like when youve got a democratic president thank you president clinton
8498019 that would be my recommendation to the city council and i believe several councilors are in favor
8498020 theres a feeling thats shared by myself and several other city councilors with the new schools being built that they have to concentrate on programming
8498021 were going to have these buildings sitting there instead of having a yearlong debate and coming up with the best solution of what to do
8498022 a proposal should have been offered to work on instead of waiting until they were going to be vacant next week why wait until sept 3 for the school committee to talk about it
8498023 i certainly dont think in this economy we can lease these buildings for low money i think we owe it to the taxpayers
8498024 i think the school committee shares my concern that the buildings need to be reused
8498025 i know the only impediment is they were swing schools so now the decision can be made
8498026 our feeling on the school committee is we should release to the city the former schools that are not part of our plans
8498027 at this point wed have to consult with ward councilors and the neighborhoods
8498028 part of the problem is were not sure if the school committee is going to use south or fitch for the central offices
8498029 we were looking to see what soon to be former schools would have the best parking and would be the best match meeting the needs for central offices
8498030 the high school in the last few years has become an office building it was never intended to be an office building
8498031 since declaring the building surplus weve debated the use of the school quite vigorously
8498032 were in the process of meeting one more time in early september to finalize a request for proposal that will be submitted to the city council
8498033 at that time theres a good possibility that the trustees will finalize the request for proposal for the banks school which will be submitted to the city council for action
8498034 were anxious to get the banks school back online it will never be a school again but it will bring it back to viability its been two years
8498035 its business for them thats all anyone cares about these days
8498036 i know stephanie and eamon are very disappointed that happened
8498037 were happy if ms gunn wants to come forward and well get something signed

8498063 i beseech you o lord in the name of your honor and by my ignominy that you have mercy on me i beseech you in the name of your strength and my weaknesses your self sufficiency and my dependence to you i submit my sinning guilty forelock you have many slaves apart from me but i have no master other than you to save me there isnt any refuge but with you nor escape from you except to you i plead you o lord in the manner of the pleading of a destitute and entreat you in the manner of a broken downtrodden man i beseech you in the manner of a blind man in fear this is a supplication o lord from one whose head is bowed down before your majesty whose nose is in the dust whose eyes are filled with tears and whose heart has submitted
8498064 oh my boy my dear child my very soul where were you didnt i tell you not to disobey me do my bidding and dont force me to punish you while i hate to do that
8498065 allah loves his creation more than a woman does her child
8498066 who was traveling through an arid land he dismounted and took shelter under a tree seeking some rest he lay there with his beast loaded with food and water at his side but when he awoke lo the beast was gone he began to search for it frantically he climbed a hill but couldnt see a trace of it he climbed another hill and still no trace of it finally when hunger and thirst overtook him he said let me go back to the tree and lay down there until death overtakes me so he went back to the tree and lay there with eyes closed in total despair and lo as he opened his eyes and raised his head there the beast was right before his very eyes with all the food and water loaded on it intact he rushed to it and picked up its halter can you imagine his happiness but lo allah is happier with a man when he turns to him seeking his forgiveness than the man who found his beast when he had lost all hopes
8498067 o my lord have mercy upon him who has no one to show mercy save you no helper save you no refuge save you no savior save you i am your slave in your need dependent on you beggar at your door you are the refuge with you is the shelter there is refuge but with you nor escape from you except to you
8498068 o allah i ask of you by the fact that you are allah there is no god except you the one the self sufficient master who begets not nor was he begotten and there is none co equal or comparable unto him
8498069 he has called upon allah by his greatest name which if he is asked by it he gives and if he is called upon by it he responds
8498070 o allah i ask you by the fact that all praise is due to you there is no god except you al hannaan the compassionate al mannaan the gracious the originator of the heavens and the earth o owner of majesty and honour o ever living self sustaining one i ask of you
8498071 he has called upon allah by his greatest name which is he is called upon by it he responds and if he is asked by it he gives
8498072 the greatest name of allah is in three soorahs of the quran in al baqarah aal imraan and ta ha
8498073 and your ilaah god is one ilaah god allah laa ilaaha illa huwa there is none who has the right to be worshipped but he the most gracious the most merciful
8498074 i do not mind which out of the two blessings was greater that allaah guided me to islaam or that he kept me away from these innovated sects
8498075 i think he felt he was defending a womans integrity
8498076 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8498077 not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
8498078 no other country on earth is my story even possible
8498079 that is the true genius of america a faith in the simple dreams of its people the insistence on small miracles
8498080 few obstacles can withstand the power of millions of voices calling for change
8498081 together starting today let us finish the work that needs to be done and usher in a new birth of freedom on this earth
8498082 you have done what the cynics said we couldnt do
8498083 you came together as democrats republicans and independents to stand up and say that we are one nation we are one people and our time for change has come
8498084 you have to look at american culture and the fact that its been 400 years for these kind of racial attitudes to develop racial behaviors to materialize and youre certainly not going to wipe that out with just someone being elected to any office in the united states
8498085 i have never been so naive as to believe that we can get beyond our racial divisions in a single election cycle or with a single candidacy particularly a candidacy as imperfect as my own
8498086 when we passed civil rights bills in 64 and 65 and under lyndon johnson racial attitudes didnt change for a long time but over time as a result of those bills they changed dramatically and in the same way martin luther king didnt change peoples attitudes immediately but over time he had an enormous impact
8498087 i remember him as a very tough guy he was a hard runner and a hard worker
8498088 he gave you everything he had on every play he was a good football player
8498089 he loved the game of football he worked very hard at it
8498090 to serve as a scapegoat for the inappropriate affairs and activities of others
8498091 a major player in this administration an intimate of the mayor making allegations of corruption
8498092 an investigatory agency perhaps the attorney general or u s attorney should be looking into this
8498093 he has sat back in a spineless way and said were going to wait for this and wait for that
8498094 is a very good turn of events for the city of pittsburgh
8498095 has been a sort of cavalier and ford centric individual and hasnt really been thinking about the good of the city
8498096 but that vision never materialized and as i have always said where there is no vision people perish i have no desire to perish along with luke ravenstahls pittsburgh
8498097 the way contracts are supposed to be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder and the way contributions have been made to the mayor i think its self evident
8498098 understanding the actual requirements mctish kunkel submitted a bid lower than the other responsive bidder
8498099 any time we see a situation where contracts are being awarded to anyone other than the lowest responsible bidder there ought to be a reason
8498100 goes much further than pat ford pittsburgh is no longer a city that is open for business pittsburgh is a city for sale
8498101 almost everything we do will have to be authorized by the pennsylvania department of transportation the private company becomes the collaborator
8498102 we know without question that this will come up for a vote we have several spare tires
8498103 its tough because the days of patronage would be over
8498104 there would be no more 1 200 dinners on nantucket they wouldnt be able to raise political contributions from consultants bond people and highway contractors
8498105 we cant pick up the road and ship it out of the country
8498106 at some point somewhere somebody has to begin critically analyzing this administration
8498107 this is certainly a big chance to showcase nationally what we hope to be about as a football program
8498108 we can show were a credible respectable football team when you play against a team like wake forest you have an opportunity to do that but we know weve got to perform at a high level with intelligence and intensity
8498109 theres a lot of excitement because we realize what an opportunity we have to show what weve got
8498110 theyve been a real dominant football team over the past two years
8498111 theyve got a quarterback who has been starting for three years and a mature defense with a lot of seniors coach grobe and his staff really emphasize defense and special teams and theyre very good in those areas
8498112 theyre going to try to manage the clock and take what the defense gives them
8498113 were going to have to play sound defense and not allow them to get into position to make plays we need to put them into third and long situations we feel real confident in our defense and i think we have the personnel to run the 4 3
8498114 i feel i can play anything but the offensive line the defensive line and quarterback weve got enough competition at quarterback already
8498115 i saw some of those guys three years ago and now theyre seniors theyre a mature football team and wont be rattled
8498116 the home field could be an unbelievable advantage for us
8498117 baylor and the city of waco have to help make it an advantage it could be a critical factor
8498118 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure
8498119 for that reason everyone in the gulf needs to be monitoring the storm
8498120 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario
8498121 we might see oil prices spike us 5 to us 8 if it really rips into platforms
8498122 combined with the deep warm waters rapid intensification could occur in a couple of days
8498123 in the uk people would ask me twice a week what julia roberts is like i bet now theyd be going on about sienna miller
8498124 expansion of the a league is a critical issue to the continuing evolution and growth of football and this is a very exciting day for ffa everyone involved in the a league gold coast united and north queensland
8498125 the gold coast is a vitally important region for football
8498126 it is one of the fastest growing regions in the country with a population already over half a million and a strong level of participation and interest in the sport
8498127 we know that the people of the gold coast enjoy supporting local teams and i have no doubt skilled park will be one of the best home grounds in the country
8498128 north queensland has met all the commercial criteria we set for them last month including local community and business support which has been terrific
8498129 i am honoured to be here tonight to support barack obama
8498130 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama
8498131 the campaign generated so much heat it increased global warming
8498132 we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to commander in chief
8498133 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8498134 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8498135 but in a world troubled by terror by trafficking in weapons drugs and people by human rights abuses by other threats to our security our interests and our values when he cannot convert adversaries into partners he will stand up to them
8498136 the university is delighted with ibms latest business growth decision as it will enhance the levels of collaboration between the enterprise and the university
8498137 the girls have adapted to the system really well especially the middles
8498138 hopefully some of the things that weve been learning some of the things theyve been adjusting to will translate into some more ws here especially this weekend
8498139 were focusing on doing things right rather than just winning
8498140 ive been pretty happy with the outcomes of some of the ways that theyre passing and the location of their passes
8498141 any time you can go and play a couple matches you learn who your game time players are you learn which players can execute under pressure
8498142 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8498143 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8498144 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8498145 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8498146 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8498147 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8498148 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8498149 es ist seit einiger zeit bekannt dass wir unsere m glichkeiten abw gen
8498150 when a tree falls in a forest obama hears it
8498151 you ruined my life america now i will destroy your world
8498152 its all about the united states of america and what is going to happen to americans who are taken prisoner in future wars
8498153 the geneva conventions protect americans if this country changes the rules its changing the rules for americans taken prisoner abroad that is far too high a price to pay so this administration can hang on to its misbegotten policies
8498154 when a tree falls in a forest obama hears it
8498155 you ruined my life america now i will destroy your world
8498156 bad is so bad that we cannot but think good an accident good is so good that we feel certain that evil could be explained
8498157 i want to emphasise that it is entirely possible that there are innocent and honest explanations the use of statutory power to require documents to be provided will enable the sfo to ascertain how funds were applied
8498158 i am prepared to wait on the court steps for them and if they dont turn up they can go away for ever
8498159 on information currently to hand there are serious questions whether donations intended for one purpose may have been put to a different purpose
8498160 the allegations concern important matters relating to the funding of a political party which go to the heart of the democratic process and involve a minister in the government
8498161 the public was firstly told that mr peters had not received any money from mr glenn then the public was told that mr peters had in fact received a donation but had not known about it and then finally yesterday they were told that mr peters had personally solicited the donation
8498162 the public are entitled to know why she withheld this crucial information for so long
8498163 pretty much what he said in the letter to the privileges committee
8498164 as youd expect the first thing i did was go away and ring mr peters
8498165 its always seemed to me that somewhere someplace there must have been some kind of contribution but it wasnt clear where
8498166 mr peters of course is on the record that the first he knew of the donation to his legal expenses was july 18
8498167 this really is one of the most significant steps forward for cancer prevention in new zealand
8498168 the ethical question is not whether it is right to vaccinate girls against a cancer that can be spread by sexual contact it is how best we can protect the lives of new zealands women
8498169 in fact medsafe fast tracked the registration of the vaccine for use in this country because the results of international clinical trials were so impressive
8498170 the dark gods march in step and i shall deliver them this world for their pleasure
8498171 what will it take for us to make it happen
8498172 how best can i incorporate my mainframe in the soa architecture
8498173 nah the 6 0 85 racquet to todays standard is a piece of junk
8498174 hello detroit hello world hire these guys they should be designing our next generation of street vehicles now
8498175 keep your panties on get your boxers out of a wad or however you want to phrase it and just try to kick back relax and have some with this contest
8498176 ich fliege in den s dwesten der usa reicht da ein 4 mm weitwinkel
8498177 a lot of players are hurting now but you can see their bodys changing and theyre toning up and getting in better basketball shape
8498178 if we want to get to the playoffs and we want to go further than that and win the championship its all on us
8498179 a big mug of coffee zoning out for about 30 minutes or so and then filling out my tps reports
8498180 a big mug of coffee zoning out for about 30 minutes or so and then filling out my tps reports
8498181 once again this government has shown that its words and commitments are meaningless and they have no intention of keeping to their word
8498182 les familles ont accept les d dommagements car la police sait se montrer tr s mena ante
8498183 lorsquils acceptent largent on leur demande de rester tranquilles de ne pas donner dinterviews aux m dias
8498184 je ne peux pas vous parler maintenant ce nest pas le bon moment nappelez plus sil vous pla t
8498185 cest vident que la construction au rabais y tait pour quelque chose sinon pourquoi les b timents c t ne se sont ils pas effondr s
8498186 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8498187 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8498188 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8498189 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8498190 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8498191 in the united states for instance as much as 30 percent of food worth some us 48 3 billion is thrown away thats like leaving the tap running and pouring 40 trillion liters of water into the garbage can enough water to meet the household needs of 500 million people
8498192 we are providing food to take care of not only our necessary consumption but also our wasteful habits
8498193 si como dicen tienen pruebas las presenten ante las instancias pertinentes donde realmente se ejerzan acciones de fiscalizaci n como puede ser el ife
8498194 porque decir que las presentar n en otras instancias de car cter pol tico como el congreso es s lo avivar el esc ndalo lo que habla de la poca seriedad con que toman su funci n de gobernar
8498195 es s lo mantener una cortina de humo frente a los temas realmente urgentes como la inseguridad y el asesinato de los dos empresarios de poza rica el pasado lunes y no son hechos aislados es el asentamiento de la delincuencia organizada en el estado como lo perciben cada d a los ciudadanos de veracruz
8498196 el de la seguridad si es un tema de gobierno un tema de urgencia y un tema serio que afecta de manera directa a los veracruzanos por lo que exigimos tanto al gobernador como a su gabinete se pongan a trabajar y cumplan a la ciudadan a con lo que es su deber porque los hechos recientes s lo demuestran su falta de resultados
8498197 no es con esc ndalo ni con campa as medi ticas como se gobierna sino con hechos
8498198 le decimos al gobierno del estado desde el gobernador y a todos sus colaboradores se pongan a trabajar y lleven a la gente soluciones que los veracruzanos sientan en su vida cotidiana
8498199 every day he gets a little bit better if we had another week hed probably be full go
8498200 im concerned only in that i havent seen them under fire
8498201 im just gonna go out there and see what its like and take in the experience hopefully play well and well win
8498202 ill just go out there and see what happens and hopefully i play and get a shot at competing with other people out there
8498203 being able to add collaboration components to your own applications thats where cocomo is going to come in you can check out more at the collaborative methods blog were exposing almost all of the functionality from connect now into components that you can use inside of your own flex applications even better cocomo will provide all the hooks you need to add a real time collaborative element to your application theres a recording available from a meeting with the cocomo team if youre interested in more info
8498204 the first session is going to be more of an overview really
8498205 devastated when informed this morning on set particularly jolene anderson who played his on screen wife
8498206 they were incredibly close their two characters just got married the spokeswoman said
8498207 like other members of the cast and crew jolene is struggling to come to terms with the death of her dear friend overnight
8498208 a tremendous young person loved and respected by his fellow all saints cast members and crew
8498209 his work on stage and screen was admired by everybody who knew him
8498210 his death is such a sad loss we at channel seven will miss his energy and smile
8498211 our thoughts and prayers are with marks family and friends
8498212 no one loved her doing it more than mark he was thrilled she said
8498213 very close tight knit group were informed on set and filming was called off for the day she said
8498214 they were devastated so we closed the set immediately as people were trying to come to terms with the tragedy the spokeswoman said
8498215 the cast have been rocked by two tragedies the seven spokeswoman said
8498216 todays consumers want the freedom to be online at any time and the existing mobile broadband pricing packages have potential risk for excessive and unexpected download charges often amounting to several hundred dollars in a month
8498217 in our experience 6gb of data allowance per month is more than sufficient for an average internet user
8498218 wir sind gegen ber jedem der als investor zu uns kommen will sehr aufgeschlossen
8498219 diese regionen haben sich als sehr effizient im umgang mit ihrem kapital gezeigt das ist etwas wovon wir bei siemens profitieren k nnten
8498220 unser ziel ist es insgesamt die bestehenden logistikdienstleistungen f r unsere verleger lieferanten und kunden rasch und erheblich zu verbessern gleichzeitig wollen wir unseren mitarbeitenden ein zeitgerechtes arbeitsumfeld bieten
8498221 die valora gruppe wird in den n chsten jahren grundlegende ver nderungen durchlaufen die weichen dazu sind nun gestellt
8498222 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8498223 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8498224 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8498225 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8498226 javais pens tort que le gouvernement f d ral viendrait au secours de ceux qui restaient il ne la pas fait et nous nallons pas r p ter la m me erreur
8498227 nous sommes pr ts vacuer la grande question est de savoir dans quel tat sont nos digues beaucoup de travail a t r alis je suis prudemment optimiste et ce sera un bon test pour nous
8498228 this event will be held on sunday sept 6 2008 from 10 a m to 12 p m at the toyota sports center 555 north nash street in el segundo
8498229 better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak out and remove all doubt
8498230 but if we look at the seven to eight year olds a different picture emerges
8498231 if i cant have more i dont see why he or she should
8498232 i think that both genes and culture play a role
8498233 social norms of equality can come into being even without extended forms of cultural transmission
8498234 nobody would dispute that the sexual maturation of children is driven by biology and genes so why should other phenotypes like those associated with fairness behaviour not also be driven by biology and genes
8498235 when there are lots of competing males trying to fertilise the eggs of females males produce larger more competitive sperm that live for longer
8498236 similarly when females detect that there are too many males competing for her eggs which may damage or kill the females play hard to get producing smaller eggs that are harder for searching sperm to find
8498237 if you cant run away from a highly competitive environment you must therefore make your gametes more competitive in order to get a higher chance of successfully reproducing
8498238 when the sperm are in competition most vertebrates have a very fast block to polysperming as soon as the first sperm is in theres an electrical block that will stop further sperm entering the eggs
8498239 but in the sea squirts that i work on that block is quite slow so it means once youre in the high sperm concentrations the levels actually become lethal to the animal because all the eggs become polyspermic and they die
8498240 coral is also broadcast spawn and the majority of marine invertebrates use this form of reproduction
8498241 one approach to restore auditory function is to replace defective cells with healthy new cells
8498242 our work shows that it is possible to produce functional auditory hair cells in the mammalian cochlea
8498243 it remains to be determined whether gene transfer into a deaf mouse will lead to the production of healthy cells that enable hearing
8498244 however we have made an important step toward defining an approach that may lead to therapeutic intervention for hearing loss
8498245 the implications are that this could treat congenital forms of hearing loss in humans
8498246 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8498247 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8498248 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8498249 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8498250 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8498251 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8498252 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8498253 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8498254 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8498255 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8498256 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8498257 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8498258 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8498259 who are open to doing something on the production side
8498260 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8498261 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8498262 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8498263 the cooper can only get down into lake eyre every thirteen or fourteen years
8498264 if you take us back thirteen or fourteen years we still havent had an event where this river the cooper has actually made it to lake eyre the last time was in 1990
8498265 on one of our sites we recorded six or seven inches in the gauge but there wasnt a skerrick of pasture growth then you get a flood and you get a beautiful pasture response
8498266 people out here have reported cattle fattening at two kilos per head per day for two to three months which is equivalent to feedlot conditions
8498267 the smaller floods as well as the mass floods are critical for species survival
8498268 eleven out of the 12 native fish species use the flood plains for breeding across a range of big and small flows
8498269 we think in excess of five million water birds came into the lake eyre basin in the big flood of 2000 they are staggering numbers
8498270 it took months almost a year to restock some of these big properties in the flood plan nowadays we can re stock them overnight
8498271 its a principle of law that a penalty should match the seriousness of the crime
8498272 we depose a dictator and create a democracy in three years with historically low casualties and it is considered a massive defeat
8498273 when a tree falls in a forest obama hears it
8498274 you ruined my life america now i will destroy your world
8498275 we guarantee that if you are bored by one version of the book youll be equally bored by any of the above
8498276 well ive been in printing for 13 years and i never saw no one try nothing like this before
8498277 co o ese carajo no puede ver una carajita porque le echa los perros
8498278 temos uma surpresa para voc s teremos um convidado especial esta noite
8498279 nosso pa s menos seguro e est mais isolado agora do que em qualquer outro momento na hist ria recente
8498280 sair do po o no qual o pa s est
8498281 nos ltimos sete anos esta administra o fracassou no momento de enfrentar as maiores for as que est o definindo este s culo a emerg ncia da r ssia china e ndia como grandes pot ncias o avan o das armas letais e a escassez do fornecimento de energia
8498282 devemos acreditar em john mccain que diz n o se deve criar um prazo para a retirada das tropas do iraque ou devemos escutar barack obama que diz que devemos transferir a responsabilidade aos iraquianos e fixar um calend rio para trazer nossas tropas de combate para casa
8498283 barack obama e eu seguimos caminhos muito diferentes para chegar a este destino mas compartilhamos uma hist ria comum

8498331 wir sind teil der eu und nicht vermittler zwischen der eu und russland eine solche vermittlerrolle w re weder sinnvoll noch richtig
8498332 da sollten wir schon auch auf die h ren die unter nazi deutschland ebenfalls oder wie polen noch mehr gelitten haben als russland
8498333 russland hat vor allem auch nach beendigung der k mpfe in georgien deutlich gemacht dass es sich an vereinbarungen nicht halten will
8498334 russland ist dabei georgien weiter zu destabilisieren mit dem ziel dort eine russlandfreundliche regierung zu etablieren das hat neben der v lkerrechtswidrigen anerkennung von abchasien und s dossetien den konflikt versch rft und eine l sung weiter erschwert

8498338 if nine inches of rain drop in 24 or 36 hours
8498339 thats twice the amount of rain that would fall in a normal month
8498340 the difference between this year and last year is the pattern shifted
8498341 theres been a slight tendency toward global warming and a slight tendency for more extreme precipitation
8498342 its a significant enough change to affect flooding to some extent
8498343 people ask what would it take to get this taken care of
8498344 money money will solve just about any issue that you have but the problem is theres not an unlimited resource of money out there were competing with other communities other projects
8498345 all the options that the corps of engineers are going to recommend for downtown findlay are going to be very costly
8498346 theres been some public resistance to imposing the sales tax
8498347 you have almost 300 000 acres of land south of findlay
8498348 approximately 10 inches of slope per mile between kenton and findlay
8498349 so youve got water coming in eight nine times faster than it can go out just based on the slope of the land
8498350 if were talking about the major inundation flood like we had in august of 07 i dont feel that development has a major role to play in that kind of flooding
8498351 development urban sprawl or whatever you might want to call it probably has an effect on the local neighborhood flood
8498352 the whole point is if you are going to build in a flood plain you cannot decrease the flood storage capacity
8498353 depends on the volume of water thats coming down the stream
8498354 so obviously if we get a volume of water thats larger than that the opening under the bridge wont be able to carry it as effectively as it would if it were designed for a larger storm
8498355 the prevailing issue in most of our decisions is economics
8498356 it becomes a matter of the impact of the cost of making the bridge opening larger to go from a 10 year storm design to an 100 year storm you could be tacking on 75 to 100 percent to the price of the project
8498357 if we still feel locally that its a viable project it would be up to us to foot the bill
8498358 in my opinion the communities just werent pulled together in the past
8498359 and they didnt pass the assessments that have to be passed to do any major engineering project

8498368 there is pressure on my team to do well in the ipl next year because last year we did not get the results we wanted that was in part was down to players coming and going for international duty
8498369 there is a limit with the number of overseas players we can play and a limit to the budget i dont know how much pietersen or flintoff will be available next year with the ashes going on thats a big competition for them
8498370 we need players who can play for us for a longer time and gel with the team not coming and going like that it is a team sport and last year shane warnes side rajasthan won through a team ethic not big names
8498371 all i really need to know i learned in kindergarten

8498373 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8498374 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8498375 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8498376 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8498377 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8498378 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8498379 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8498380 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8498381 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8498382 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8498383 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8498384 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8498385 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8498386 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8498387 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8498388 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8498389 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8498390 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8498391 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8498392 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8498393 thomas cook moves in a very volatile fashion between rs 78 to about rs 104 if it can take rs 104 out you are probably looking at rs 121 and in an extreme case rs 143 whenever you have such ranging kind of market double digit stocks tend to do things on both sides
8498394 similarly on fortis healthcare again a hospital kind of stock relatively safer than lot of other things so rs 66 is a key support here could run up to about rs 82 and then probably rs 88 again trading moves around rs 88 90 it has significant resistance and people need to get out

8498406 as we gather here tonight our country is less secure and more isolated than it has been at any time in recent history the bush foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8498407 we have been given a tentative date by ipl they want us to come to india on august 30 but i have replied to them that such a date wasnt possible

8498442 the fact john mccain dispatched his paid consultant to launch this despicable ad from a so called independent committee shows how desperate he is to change the subject from his shocking disconnect with the economic struggles of the american people
8498443 he knows that barack obama has denounced the detestable crimes that bill ayers committed 40 years ago
8498444 why would barack obama be friends with somebody who bombed the capitol and is proud of it
8498445 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8498446 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8498447 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8498448 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8498449 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8498450 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8498451 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8498452 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8498453 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

8498458 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8498459 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8498460 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8498461 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

8498464 two there should be no more no less one to embody power the other to crave it
8498465 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8498466 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8498467 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8498468 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

8498557 the story appealed me very much it was my father who first met the real family and he showed me synopsis it is then that we decided why not make a film on such a strong issue
8498558 the production has completely stopped the only films that are doing well are pushto films and with indian films releasing in pakistan they do not have any chance to stand
8498559 no why should i we should face the truth it is something which is already dying indian films have only accelerated the pace so it is better to done away with what is dying and start all over again

8498579 ini sekaligus untuk mengurangi kerinduan saya dan untuk nostalgia juga karena sejak kecil saya sudah mulai suka mendengar dan menyanyikan lagu lagu india ya selain itu untuk mengingatkan kembali kepada khalayak tentang tanah hindustan itu sebagai tempat bersejarah bagi genre musik dangdut
8498580 yang pasti ada beberapa kesulitan karena itu bukan bahasa saya sehari hari tapi saya belajar bahasa india ya walaupun tidak sempurna sempurna sekali tapi bisa dibilang saya puas dan syukur atas selesainya penggarapan lagu ini untuk pengucapan lirik dengan bahasa india memang tidak mudah karena bahasa hindi sama seperti bahasa arab kalau penyebutannya panjang atau dengungannya salah maksudnya akan jadi lain
8498581 ya kita pingin agar orang india yang mendengar lagu ini tidak akan menyangka kalau penyanyinya adalah orang indonesia dan malaysia

8498600 there is a significant and growing undersupply of housing in australia which is evidenced by historically low vacancy rates and rising rents
8498601 uncertainty remains as to the timing of a recovery in the housing market and the commencement of a number of large scale property development projects is subject to a number of variables including the time taken to gain regulatory and other approvals
8498602 notwithstanding the above and based on the companys latest budget projections directors are expecting at this stage that the result for the 2008 09 year will be around 15 per cent up on the year just ended
8498603 the consolidated entity could not be liable for more than 2 96 million
8498604 under the terms of the proposed settlement the group would incur a net cost after expenses and tax of up to 40 million which will be funded by cash and available facilities
8498605 recent comprehensive and systematic reviews of the evidence show that food advertising affects what children eat what they prefer to eat and what they pester their parents for
8498606 the federal government needs to put in place legislation that protects children supports parents and does not undermine campaigns to promote healthy lifestyles
8498607 it is a shame that the revised standards have put broadcasters revenue before our childrens health
8498608 a national ban on junk food advertising during childrens tv viewing hours is a sensible first step in tackling childhood obesity
8498609 an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure
8498610 senator browns amendment if successful would potentially compromise acmas standing as an independent regulatory body

8498614 the bottom line however is that the strong negative trend in summertime ice extent characterizing the past decade continues
8498615 we could have no ice at the north pole at the end of this summer and the reason here is that the north pole area right now is covered with very thin ice and this ice we call first year ice the ice that tends to melt out in the summer
8498616 its possible that ships could sail from alaska right to the north pole
8498617 clearly if you look over what we have seen in the past three years and where we were headed we are in this long term decline and we may have no ice at all in the arctic ocean in summer by 2030 or so

8498625 hes doing a great job its funny we have the same numbers its great to be there now but you kind of look at where you are at the end of the season and gauge from that
8498626 we checked on him going into the eighth and he said i feel great
8498627 he ended up throwing some pitches on that walk you have to do this a step at a time these guys get extended sometimes he will get an extra day so that will help
8498628 he gets on top of the ball hes like a whirling dervish out there hes got some deception hes got thump with the fastball hes got a sharp breaking ball hes got a slider and then he has that filthy changeup he was on tonight
8498629 oh you didnt get that job you wanted working for the wedding photographer
8498630 its hard to imagine the star tribune without the associated press but thats what could happen in 2010 the regions biggest news source recently sent the nations most prominent wire service the required two years cancellation notice
8498631 if a split comes to pass strib readers will notice changes from the biggest international headlines to the smallest sports agate type just this morning i counted at least 18 ap stories or photos in the stribs news sections a wire service credit was attached nearly all the national sports news and briefs plus a half dozen business and variety items
8498632 we have the utmost respect for ap this is not a hostile gesture by any means its the beginning of an assessment of our business model not the end

8498636 things will come to a screeching halt if they dont extend the production tax credit
8498637 you have to forge ahead you have to continue to work the projects on a daily basis
8498638 there are too many intricate complex components that have to be completed on timetables and milestones and if those milestones dont get completed and dont get met those projects will never come to fruition
8498639 that means that the wind marketplace right now is going crazy
8498640 its driving the cost of wind turbines through the roof it means that a lot of developers are working day and night trying to get their projects finished so that they can meet that production tax credit deadline
8498641 without the production tax credit were going to see that it will be more difficult for us to be able to bring more wind onto the system because our customers will have to pay more for it
8498642 now we can still do it of course but it will just mean that the price of power will go up
8498643 it will generate about 525 000 in cash back to those local shareholders on an annual basis

8498646 what can you do to assure the voters that the congress is not in gridlock

8498661 i personally spend at least 2 hours a day researching baseball betting trends and buying activity while watching the latest sell reports from ladnier neisler investment firm inc when i put all this information together i have a better idea of how to allocate my baseball betting monies and portfolio following this step and keeping with the advice of weitzman wilkes the successful investor will augment baseball betting shares returning a yield of 7 or better while minimizing losses from lower end performers timing is crucial in this step if you get out too soon youll risk missing a possible market spike but if you hold too long you may miss the seasonal changes in the baseball betting market and be stuck holding the bag until another buying cycle starts
8498662 you dont have to be a millionaire to make cash when dealing with baseball betting securities
8498663 most successful traders start with as little as one thousand dollars and slowly build from there
8498664 look this isnt some 30 second sound byte promising you a life of wealth and luxury without any work you have to work hard in this baseball betting field and that is the only way to become a success
8498665 it took me forever to get my portfolio to the point where it was making a steady flow of cash but once it was i knew that sustaining this cash flow would be an entirely new challenge luckily for me i successfully reinvested baseball betting marketing dividends and was able to capitalize on a strong bull market
8498666 i started out following all the zany and crazy ideas i could find that promised a quick buck in the end however i learned that working with baseball betting can be challenging and there are no short cuts to success take your time and follow the advice in this article ways to get the most out of baseball betting development and use offered by flury villandry ratz sinka an author and noted scholar talks to us about baseball betting development if youre looking to make some dough in the baseball betting industry the best paying positions are sales corporate law executive management and operations

8498678 if downside risks to the dollar emerge from here on the market will keep in mind the possibility of similar action by authorities

8498696 a lawyer may outsource legal or nonlegal support services provided the lawyer remains ultimately responsible for rendering competent legal services to the client
8498697 the use of a local photocopy shop for the reproduction of documents to the retention of a document management company for the creation and maintenance of a database for complex litigation or even to the engagement of a group of foreign lawyers to draft patent applications

8498700 for where you go i will go and where you lodge i will lodge
8498701 the bible recognizes that all those proximate evils from which god saves his people are manifestations of the far deeper disorder in human life
8498702 p 25 original emphasis with full quotations of key scripture texts a welcome feature throughout this book wright shows that salvation from sin is not just a new testament perspective
8498703 religions in themselves are no answer to our deepest problems
8498704 nobody else deserves even the vocabulary of salvation let alone the reality of it
8498705 the bible is fundamentally a grand narrative with four major parts or sections creation fall redemption in history new creation
8498706 the story of salvation is what fills the gap between the scattering of the nations in genesis 11 and the healing of the nations in revelation 22 p
8498707 salvation is contained not in christianity as a religion but in the story that christians tell in bearing witness to the biblical god and what god has done in history for our salvation salvation is guaranteed by and because of what god has done not by our religious beliefs or practices

8498713 about america finally beginning to come to grips with the complexity of the racial issues that have bedeviled us for so long
8498714 this is a huge step this is a generational step
8498715 the word history gets thrown around and its used rather loosely
8498716 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job of hiding it tonight
8498717 it was like watching muhammad ali come out of retirement
8498718 para escolher um papel procuro algo novo que nunca tenha feito antes n o gosto de repeti es me interesso mais pela hist ria e pelo diretor do que pelo personagem
8498719 tive sorte porque os outros atores que desempenharam papel de cegos tiveram que trabalhar muito mais que eu

8498722 temos uma surpresa para voc s teremos um convidado especial esta noite
8498723 se n o me engano hillary clinton sacudiu a casa na noite passada
8498724 bill clinton um exemplo de presidente que tem o povo como sua prioridade
8498725 nosso pa s menos seguro e est mais isolado agora do que em qualquer outro momento na hist ria recente
8498726 sair do po o no qual o pa s est
8498727 nos ltimos sete anos esta administra o fracassou no momento de enfrentar as maiores for as que est o definindo este s culo a emerg ncia da r ssia china e ndia como grandes pot ncias o avan o das armas letais e a escassez do fornecimento de energia
8498728 devemos acreditar em john mccain que diz n o se deve criar um prazo para a retirada das tropas do iraque ou devemos escutar barack obama que diz que devemos transferir a responsabilidade aos iraquianos e fixar um calend rio para trazer nossas tropas de combate para casa
8498729 barack obama e eu seguimos caminhos muito diferentes para chegar a este destino mas compartilhamos uma hist ria comum
8498730 essa a am rica que o presidente george w bush nos deixou e esse o futuro que nos oferecer john mccain
8498731 wir erleben dass viele aktionen der jugendlichen spektakul rer sind auch ist mehr gewalt im spiel generell werden sie aber nicht krimineller es wird nur mehr hingesehen aber es ist nicht g nstig zu sagen dass alle verurteilt werden sollen es bedarf anderer wege es ist gut dass jugendliche ab 14 jahre strafbar sind es braucht aber ganz viele aktivit ten um auff llige jugendliche schon vor dem 14 lebensjahr aufzufangen
8498732 i also played a very small part in his movie mutta mesthri there was a scene which showed a school and i was one of the children in that scene it will be an honour to meet the star
8498733 my children are here with me since the past seven days and they have missed school they will stay put with us until we meet him
8498734 we have already spent rs 20 000 and i do not care about the amount as long as we get to meet our hero
8498735 kita melakukan exercise kepada kejati kejari pasca urip ditangkap kita lihat beberapa bulan ke depan kalau tidak serius sudah cukup terhadap institusi ini
8498736 ini penegakan hukum tidak mesti di kpk harus dibagi bagi peran selama ini kpk menangkap politisi tapi untuk yang kecil kecil tidak
8498737 saya khawatir nanti malah berubah jadi pusat transaksi yang lainnya seperti narkoba
8498738 ada yang parkir saja sudah untung apalagi sampai sekedar nongkrong
8498739 sangat gelap nggak ada yang berani ikut ngejar ke dalam
8498740 has refused to cooperate with the government and recall the products
8498741 sfca maintains that it is not responsible for products previously manufactured by simplicity inc
8498742 the efforts of our early childhood teachers have a role in the success of our high school students
8498743 it was our choice to do it all at once creating only one year of transition rather than keeping the district in transition for four to five years
8498744 with the transition we knew we would lose our k 8 school histories the last three years of state data that is used for showing student improvement
8498745 we knew as we started redesigning teaching and learning in the district that it would take time several years before we would see significant improvement
8498746 our k 8th grade principals can now look at individual students and see what specific areas of learning they had difficulty with
8498747 we try to play games with the kids like mixing up the turkeys and chickens and letting them guess which is which
8498748 we kind of watch by the end of the fair some of these are really tame
8498749 weve had counts of several thousands during a regular day
8498750 we are going to stay with a friend in cortland until we can find a home but he didnt get off work until 4 p m it was noon and we had nowhere to go
8498751 i told her come lay down take a shower eat some lunch
8498752 i wasnt going to let her stay in her car anymore
8498753 the manager knew we are friends and told me i could be evicted if i allowed them to move in
8498754 i understand that but i didnt think allowing her to stay here for a few hours after surgery would get me evicted
8498755 i own my trailer i take care of myself and my pets i dont want anyone to do anything for me but i want to stay in my home
8498756 she just let me lay down there for a few hours after the surgery
8498757 i cant afford a lawyer or anything and when i saw this it broke my heart
8498758 i can go live in the shelter if i have to i dont have anywhere else to go but ill have to find someplace for my pets if i had it to do again i would still do it i couldnt leave her with no place to lay down
8498759 this is not a ban nor does it encourage the use of paper bags
8498760 the only thing that will cost the city of pullman is to do nothing
8498761 this is a bad time in the economy to introduce this fee
8498762 mary shelleys novel is exceedingly rich and complex the exhibition alludes to some of these thematic threads while making a case that the continued examination of these issues is imperative for a vital society
8498763 thematically i think this is a fairly open ended exhibit
8498764 i hope it encourages visitors to look at frankenstein on a metaphoric level as the ultimate other the idea is that not only does one have an impact on a community but a responsibility to it
8498765 during a five year tour the exhibition visited 82 libraries across america this aspect of the projects history drew to a close a year or so ago since then we decided to reanimate the project and make it available to interested libraries
8498766 i thought that it would be a really interesting exhibit to bring because the possibilities are endless think of how dr frankensteins creation has permeated popular culture most things with the franken prefix are overwhelmingly bad but why what is it about frankenstein that resonates with us so deeply and yet incurs such dread
8498767 i think the exhibition will encourage audiences to explore the interdisciplinary nature of science and the intersections of science and philosophy and science and morality
8498768 in an era of genetically modified food stem cell research and cloned sheep frankenstein is more relevant and perhaps more cautionary than ever before
8498769 were really glad to get the frankenstein exhibit during the fall
8498770 every day he gets a little bit better if we had another week hed probably be full go
8498771 im concerned only in that i havent seen them under fire
8498772 im just gonna go out there and see what its like and take in the experience hopefully play well and well win
8498773 ill just go out there and see what happens and hopefully i play and get a shot at competing with other people out there
8498774 lets prepare for the worst and hope for the best
8498775 this storm could change direction and it could change in intensity
8498776 all i can think about is this game at this point
8498777 well see what happens today but the bottom line is they sucked
8498778 even without having our two best pitchers so forth and so on they still stunk thats the bottom line
8498779 you dont want to think about that until youre counted out by the numbers were still going to go out there play hard and see what happens
8498780 everybody has that month where were as good as alex rodriguez is
8498781 ive had those months before where i was pretty darn good and i know a bunch of these other guys have all of us just need to be really good
8498782 this sends a message that washington is committed to taiwans defense
8498783 and with some sort of framework for improved cross strait relations under consideration taiwan needs to bargain from a position of strength
8498784 but the fact is unless these harpoons have some sort of magical power anything that costs 90 million isnt going to dramatically tip the balance one way or the other
8498785 my guess is that the administration was waiting until the olympics were over so as not to embarrass president hu jintao and the chinese leadership
8498786 now that bush has returned my expectation is that we will see a number of sales move ahead to congress for review in the weeks ahead
8498787 it seems there isnt urgency to move forward and perhaps even a preference to leave this decision to bushs successor
8498788 det g r ont n i dag n r jag pratar om det
8498789 n r blodet b rjade spruta s f rstod jag att n san g tt av
8498790 n r blodet b rjade spruta s f rstod jag att n san g tt av
8498791 i plan to stay here only i will not move
8498792 the so called autonomous bodies dont bother about government guidelines and dont do anything its only on the surface iits are even worse than other universities i called the iit delhi director and his first response to me was we are not covered by the reservation policy they are getting full government grants so how can they not follow it
8498793 its like this when the daughter in law comes home she has to be part of the house then its the same thing with iit and its students now they are here and we will make the best of this obviously when there are so many people some will agree and will disagree but in the end it was a unanimous decision nothing more has to be said on this
8498794 i dont want to say too much on this matter but yes a lot of awakening is required even in the hrd ministry
8498795 note well there seems to be no saturday event on the schedule joementum
8498796 is maverick actually going to drop joementum on us on friday
8498797 im zweiten quartal verloren die deutschen tageszeitungen 2 2 prozent der auflage gegen ber 2007
8498798 die auflage seit jahren stur um 2 5 prozent zur ck
8498799 nun ja eine beschreibung die auch auf jeden blog passen k nnte ausgew hlt wird schlie lich auch da und auch nicht nur die verlobte von boris becker ganz im gegenteil solche klatschgeschichten kommen dort ganz im gegensatz zu den etablierten medien eher selten vor
8498800 nie waren handwerklich und ethisch gut ausgebildete journalisten notwendiger als heute um das berleben des qualit tsjournalismus in der digitalen welt zu sichern
8498801 enth lt wenig was neu oder berpr fbar w re
8498802 drohen die medien zum surrealen kettenbrief digitaler illusionen und t uschungen zu werden wo die fakten durch meinungen und die professionellen nachrichtensammeler von durchgeknallten kommentatoren ersetzt werden
8498803 are you tired of getting all that junk mail telephone calls during dinner if you are this site is for you
8498804 i never backed down from a challenge i always did my own fighting i was never afraid to say what i thought and i was never hesitant to fight for a cause that i believed in
8498805 the club is looking to make its mark in a wider area and signing a big name player would possibly help that and would help me if they are of the right standard
8498806 but it wont help the team if you just buy lads at the back end of their career just looking for a final pay day they wont get anywhere near my team if they are not capable of helping it
8498807 i believe cesc brings calm and confidence to the side and overall we had a good balance here
8498808 i felt the whole team was sharper and physically much better than on saturday that is what made it easier
8498809 the response after saturday was clear there was togetherness focus and efficiency and that is what you want on such a night with so much at stake
8498810 no evil can happen to a good man either in life or after death

8498822 that makes two of us actually that makes 18 million of us because like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8498823 the american dream is under siege at home and american leadership in the world has been weakened
8498824 clearly the job of the next president is to rebuild the american dream and to restore american leadership in the world everything i learned in my eight years as president and work done since convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8498825 i used to work in a fire hydrant factory you couldnt park anywhere near the place

8498834 with barack obama as our president theyll look at us again theyll trust us again and well be able to lead again
8498835 these upbeat capital goods numbers amid a downtrodden u s consumer sector indicates how helpful a weak dollar is in the current cycle
8498836 the recent downturn in growth abroad and stabilization of the dollar could put pressure on capital goods spending in the months ahead
8498837 exports are holding up a lot better than we thought they would with the weakness in europe and japan and we are seeing the impact of the stimulus package on business investment decisions
8498838 fixeu vos en aquesta g bia plena de milers de micos que el meu cap us va comprar a 10 i 20 euros per a la seva col lecci jo us ofereixo vendre us els micos per 35 euros i quan el cap torni de la ciutat els hi veneu pels 50 que us ha ofert
8498839 they actually want us to reward them for the last eight years by giving them four more lets send them a message that will echo from the rockies all across america thanks but no thanks in this case the third time is not the charm
8498840 most important barack obama knows that america cannot be strong abroad unless we are strong at home people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power

8498852 no camp received 1 million from equality california a major gay rights organization
8498853 were happy with the verdict but its a shame this should have been limited to one death
8498854 he should have had the courage and the guts to kill himself before killing anyone else
8498855 this defendant is dangerous he is a predator who takes pride in his work
8498856 he earned this day his actions call out for the death penalty
8498857 by the verdict today they have given voice to the victims
8498858 i cant speak for shasta i cant get inside her head
8498859 possibly now well have to be dragged through a court proceeding in california if they go ahead with the prosecution it would be such as waste of taxpayer money because hell never spend a day in a california prison

8498870 to personally update golding on the proposed establishment of a political union
8498871 i applaud the notion and i think it is a grand idea worth pursuing
8498872 prime minister barrow commended mr manning and his team but expressed belizes well known reservations about certain aspects of such integration
8498873 recognised in international law as a sovereign and cohesive entity
8498874 joint declaration on collaboration towards the achievement of single economy and political integration between grenada st lucia st vincent and the grenadines and the republic of trinidad and tobago
8498875 they are present not only in the uk but also in the states also in latin america and now are moving onto asia
8498876 so you have these large banks sort of balancing their risks in one part of the world and in another
8498877 anything that the bank invests in has to be on the same balance sheet
8498878 so far because of their business mix which is retail because of the tight regulation they are better placed than other banks in europe mr garcia says
8498879 the problem is that the economy is in a very bad situation and i think its going to be a long process of downturn

8498883 our job as opfor is to simulate an enemy force similar to that at the actual red flag with the standard training rules and similar scenarios
8498884 and tomorrow in case we need to fight somewhere together we will be able to integrate very well within a short time
8498885 dad always likened writing a field guide to serving a prison sentence

8498898 its pretty daunting to follow in the diet coke hunks footsteps but maybe its time for him to retire everyone at mother is completely over excited about this appointment and its probably one of the biggest things thats ever happened to us
8498899 coca cola europe has enlisted mother london to explore creative work for diet coke and coke light
8498900 in light of this coca cola great britain is currently reviewing the role vccp will play on diet coke

8499348 i dont think anybody likes training camp but i need it
8499349 everybody needs it were rusty so we need it for our techniques to get in shape to get our bodies accustomed to getting pounded and getting hit and its good to get back into the playbook and refresh the plays its not all bad
8499350 the biggest reason hes lasted 15 years is hes a tremendous athlete
8499351 but he has seen a little bit of everything he understands what it takes to play this game how to prepare how to manage himself and he knows his body

8499353 a lot of people think youve got to drink fluids the morning of practice and games but youve got to get hydrated the night before or days before you actually have to perform so i drink a lot all week water gatorade electrolytes at least a gallon a day
8499354 i take care of myself so i eat what i want i just work it off
8499355 every minute of camp is valuable so youve got to schedule your stuff when i get downtime i relax a lot of tv sleep if ive got business deals on the table ill handle that taking care of business outside of football but outside stuff thats not important is put off

8499368 dont give up yet its not over if god forbid we fail and were not on the ballot wait two years and lets just do what weve been doing from the beginning
8499369 its premature right now to start picking apart the dream
8499370 id like to see it get done and id like to seen a plan to do it
8499371 the failure to have a plan is a plan to fail thats an old saying but it does have some credibility to it

8499373 everybody wants to know what this things going to cost

8499377 there is genuine concern about the difficulties that people will face paying their heating bills over the coming winter and we are looking at extra support
8499378 to be as simple as possible i just want to play football

8499387 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house
8499388 and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8499389 quite frankly i dont care what john mccain does with his ads
8499390 i think what hes doing is a little silly and trite apparently he doesnt understand that theres an economic crisis evolving in this country
8499391 people will be looking to understand the rationale besides party loyalty and party unity what is the specific rationale behind his support of barack obama
8499392 if it cant be done i have great concern that these hearings will be virtually or exclusively classified closed to the public and i might add to the detainees
8499393 laughed at the suggestion and certainly did not call mccain on it
8499394 rove is pushing romney so aggressively some folks are beginning to wonder whats going on
8499395 romney is already vetted by the media has strong executive experience both in business and in government has an interesting story to tell with saving the u s olympics and also helps mccain deal with the economy because he can speak to the economy with a fluency that mccain doesnt have

8499400 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8499401 barack obama is ready to honor the oath to preserve protect and defend the constitution president of the united states
8499402 we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar
8499403 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history
8499404 and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8499405 and just in case you were wondering i think reminded us of what its like when youve got a president who actually puts people first
8499406 caseys maintained that shes protecting caylee and shes also protecting the family from physical harm we believe that 100 percent

8499414 he told me look we wont be remembering this at your thirtieth wedding anniversary
8499415 of course i start to breathe after somebody passed gas

8499530 so for the girls there are only the big singles left
8499531 the girls im most attracted to are always a lot like me
8499532 if you dont realize that paul butterworth is singing an 8 minute long karaoke theres a lot of things you arent going to realize
8499533 i hope you sit next to a big fat person on the airplane
8499534 you know one day youre actually going to kill me and ill be laughing in heaven as they throw your butt in jail
8499535 i couldnt have stood out more if i was riding a brontosaurus through there

8499540 me not saying something and you not writing it down are two completely different things

8499546 thats a hot outfit letoto if you were any taller
8499547 oh uncle johnny i didnt know you could look so handsome

8499550 you remind me of my friend deanna shes a female bodybuilder
8499551 i was taking down the donkey from the nativity scene in our kitchen and i thought to myself if i drop the donkey on the floor and it breaks then i can tell people that i broke my ass on the kitchen floor
8499552 you see the difference between me and you is my mouth gets me into trouble and yours gets you out of it
8499553 the geisha sleep in certain positions so as not to disturb their elaborate hairdos and thats what i was just doing
8499554 i dont want to be tied down and have my time consumed by someone there to say i love you to and having to hold hands and shop together and eat with and no one to hold and cuddle with i can play xbox all night long baby
8499555 finally i got up and read my bible i figured that would put me to sleep

8499562 i promise i really did check him out before i started dating him
8499563 so i was typing to you and there was dead silence on the phone and forgot i was on the phone with my mom and she randomly started talking and it startled me
8499564 whos the one whose name begins with a j and ends with an n
8499565 go shopping with him and youll never be satisfied with another mans shopping again
8499566 do you guys have a money changer in the temple
8499567 its like the military here i have to say yes sir to my roommate
8499568 i cant believe you said makeout in front of my mom

8499573 this is the first time shes been publicly traded on the girl exchange and her stock has gone sky high
8499574 this isnt fair prybys only got on your wall of quotes because pretty much anything that proceeds from her mouth is notably retarded
8499575 youre just upset because you cant put that on facebook
8499576 theres a stomach virus going around and every girl on my hall has been inflicted with the terror
8499577 youre like a reality t v show i want to turn the channel and walk away but for some strange reason i cant
8499578 i own too many nice ties not to go to the spring banquet
8499579 god blessed me with great hair im counting on that to bring me true love
8499580 this song was written for my future wife which is none of you
8499581 i hope i dont get married til im in grad school so i can pick up undergrad chicks too
8499582 i have a new vein on my leg i feel like an old woman one of those blue nasty ones
8499583 may it not be said of me methinks she doth protest too much because really im just raising a voice for all of us you choose to mercilessly poke numerous times throughout the day
8499584 cause all my good looking genes cant override someone whos ugly
8499585 i lost it from all the throwing up i did
8499586 you know if you keep breathing like that when i talk to you about girls youre never going to get married
8499587 i dont sleep with him any more john hes older than me hes older than you
8499588 i cant explain the honor of having two quotes on your profile it gives one the sense that they are going to be somebody wow
8499589 can i suck some of your blood so that i can be a pirate
8499590 if i was bored and had a lot of spare time i would count how many pictures of lauren duncan i had on my computer
8499591 i dont feel comfortable with you saying that and wearing those shorts
8499592 hey lance was telling me about this job at the hospital they charge you nine dollars an hour
8499593 do you think they slimmed your dad down for that picture
8499594 hey ah can i have a lead apron too im feeling kinda exposed here
8499595 gino that lady over there is staring oh my god you are freaking them out
8499596 thats it youre going in before you get us in trouble
8499597 were happy with the verdict but its a shame this should have been limited to one death
8499598 he should have had the courage and the guts to kill himself before killing anyone else
8499599 this defendant is dangerous he is a predator who takes pride in his work
8499600 he earned this day his actions call out for the death penalty
8499601 by the verdict today they have given voice to the victims
8499602 i cant speak for shasta i cant get inside her head
8499603 possibly now well have to be dragged through a court proceeding in california if they go ahead with the prosecution it would be such as waste of taxpayer money because hell never spend a day in a california prison
8499604 generally for human beings its pretty hard to maintain impartiality when confronted with such horror
8499605 the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander chief sound familiar
8499606 well i dont think i will do anything with you guys on nye because i want to spend it with my dad

8499613 im just a regular guy trying to make a difference in this world
8499614 those 65 or older have long been the poor population and that really has changed for a very short window 30 or at the most 40 years
8499615 now were seeing a contraction of those income support systems that supported the elderly namely social security and worker pensions
8499616 i worry about the huge national debt that will affect all of us and the poor economic outlook
8499617 i have five grandchildren and i wonder what kind of world will their grandchildren have
8499618 with plane fare hotel and extra expenses it would have been way over 1 000 and im on a very fixed income
8499619 its too bad the days are gone when hardworking immigrants could become part of the middle class and my heart goes out to people trying to keep or buy a house nowadays since taxes heating and other rising costs are making this less possible
8499620 this republican trickle down idea it evaporates before it gets down to anybody else real democrats know that
8499621 productivity actually grew faster over the 2000s cycle than over the 1990s 2 5 percent annually in the 2000 07 period vs 2 percent in the 1990
8499622 when it comes to efficient profitable production the men and women of the american work force have a lot to be proud of but when it comes to being rewarded for the work they do the skills theyve sharpened and the contributions theyve made well thats a different story
8499623 their paychecks have been frozen their health coverage is being cut back theyre facing greater global competition and their pensions are more precarious than ever
8499624 today top corporate executives earn 275 times as much as the average worker compared to only 27 times in 1973
8499625 the disconnect between pay and productivity has never been stronger
8499626 whats your theory on what happens to socks that get lost in the dryer
8499627 gt rs were only available in japan occasionally australia and they always had right hand drive
8499628 partly because they were not available here they became forbidden fruit and they developed an underground following in the united states hard core car enthusiasts know about godzilla
8499629 thats the whole point we wanted to make this car so that it is a multipurpose vehicle if you want to drive like your hairs on fire it will do that pretty well
8499630 or you can use it like a normal car to cruise back and forth to work in comfort it will do that well too
8499631 wanted to be able to carry out a normal conversation between driver and passenger at 186 miles an hour so theres very little wind noise or other interior noise
8499632 you hear it and you think to yourself what the heck is going on back there but the sounds are normal thats all because of the transmissions being located in the rear so yes youll have some discomfiting sounds
8499633 theres also hydraulic pumps back there engaging and disengaging the clutches as you go and theres sounds involved in that too
8499634 i expect the pace of foreclosure prevention to continue to accelerate
8499635 another thing this season is trying to discern from all the girls out there the ones that are ethnically ambiguous girls and boys that have faces that you cant just put in a certain place or race or geography i think its very helpful to see those types of faces in our conflicted world because you can see that were still evolving as humans and they are the results of people willing to go beyond the socially constructed notions around race i think thats really important and were going to see even more of those as the population changes
8499636 i owed a drug dealer or he said he would kill my family if i didnt

8499646 catholic groups demonstrated outside canada house in london on tuesday in protest against the deportation of us soldiers who refused to fight in iraq and sought asylum in canada
8499647 canada stop deporting us soldiers who refuse to fight in the illegal war in iraq
8499648 in the year that franz jagerstater was beatified by the pope in recognition of his conscientious objection and subsequent execution for refusing to serve in hitlers army it seems extraordinary that the canadian government is adopting this position these soldiers have every right to refuse to fight in an illegal war
8499649 now for a few updates on the home front army deserter robin long a boise native was sentenced to 15 months in jail after being kicked out of canada and returned to his unit at fort carson colo he will also get a dishonorable discharge

8499651 the most engaging aspect of the sutras is delgados quest for co status although hes ostracized for his stance overall hes treated quite fairly
8499652 the analysis by the times found that obama donors gave 300 000 to mrs clinton in july and 135 000 in june
8499653 the democrats nominated a junior inexperienced senator with no legislative accomplishments on his resume to whom young americans and latte liberals swarmed due to his cool celebrity like demeanor but then those same democratic leaders act surprised that middle america isnt following suit how bizarre
8499654 the meltdown of progressive blogosphere 1 0 is due in large part to major a list bloggers turning a blind eye to misogyny and sexism because it helped the candidate they supported massive fail
8499655 apart from their assertion which is false that obama will end the occupation of iraq the authors make no attempt to substantiate their claim that obama represents a stark ideological contrast with mccain in fact they virtually acknowledge just the opposite
8499656 the party is worried now about mass defections by clinton supporters to john mccain well what in the hell did they expect after the may 31 charade effectively handing obama the nomination they lost what little chance they had in the fall dont expect clinton supporters to get over it any more than gore supporters when the 2000 election was stolen
8499657 we wont leave government house as ordered by the civil court
8499658 our demands remain the same to have the government resign and to prevent an amendment of the 2007 constitution
8499659 a lot of white workers and quite frankly a lot of union members believe hes the wrong race
8499660 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8499661 everything ive learned in eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8499662 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8499663 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8499664 a leader who can deliver change the change that everybody knows we need
8499665 the candidate who once promised a contest of ideas now has nothing left but personal attacks
8499666 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8499667 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country
8499668 were not little kids to be told what to do in a half hour

8499681 were trying to stretch them and were trying to put them in as many pressure situations as possible
8499682 really none of the guys have punted the punting is probably more up for grabs than the kicking
8499683 we are using john as a quarterback and he is throwing every day
8499684 we want him to throw during a game we want him to be a dual threat we said going into summer that we wanted colt to run it more in the offense not just scrambling and we said we want john to throw it more and better
8499685 i am so very glad and grateful to be able to see his face

8499766 there is absolutely no slack in the system any more
8499767 oil has shaped our civilisation without crude oil youd have no cars no shipping no planes
8499768 youd see no plastics no bags no toys no cases on tvs computers or radios its absolutely everywhere
8499769 much of the economic expansion and growth of the human population in the 20th century is directly tied to the availability of large amounts of cheap oil
8499770 there isnt a single good or service consumed on the planet except in rural economies that doesnt have oil embedded in it oil is the lifeblood of the global economy
8499771 if you have a facility like this and a plane crashed into it or terrorists get in and somehow succeed in blowing it up then you have a very very significant disruption on your hands that is what analysts see as a doomsday scenario
8499772 if one or two of these facilities goes down then the entire system goes down
8499773 its hardly conceivable that the world could function without oil
8499774 to get these alternatives close to what oil can do you have to invest a lot of money
8499775 these arent insurmountable problems but they suggest the transition has some formidable challenges
8499776 the refresh cycle were currently seeing in the midrange and high end segments is part of the it transformation cycle that is continuing as older scalable systems with 4 sockets 8 sockets or more are being replaced either by new scale up servers or by groups of scale out servers
8499777 the growth in midrange and high end servers this quarter shows that customers still see value in leveraging these scalable servers with built in high availability and ras features for some of their most mission critical workloads and for workload consolidation
8499778 ibm regained the top spot in unix market share on the strength of its power based system p and merged power systems families growing revenues nearly 25 7 in the quarter and gaining 5 1 percentage points in year over year comparisons
8499779 sun took second position with a 31 1 share posting a drop of 5 6 percentage points from a year ago and hp rounded out the top three with a 25 8 share and a gain of 1 percentage point overall the unix market remains a significant source of revenue and competition among the top three suppliers
8499780 while all the major vendors exhibited strong unit growth there was significant price competition throughout the quarter
8499781 low end volume servers such as 1 and 2 socket systems are somewhat viewed as commodities and experienced the most pricing pressure additionally the quarter was made noteworthy by the fact that several of the tier one vendors began shipping their new systems targeting large scale datacenters typically these are stripped down servers that are designed to operate at maximum power efficiency all components and features that are not essential including server redundancy are eliminated to reduce the capital expenditure of these datacenter customers
8499782 i want everybody to understand why im so proud to have joe biden
8499783 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8499784 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8499785 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8499786 with eyes firmly fixed on the future and in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8499787 with faith in our party and our country lets declare together with one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8499788 but i profoundly disagree with the direction that john wants to take the country for example john thinks that during the bush years weve made great progress economically i think its been abysmal
8499789 and in the senate john sided with president bush 95 percent of the time
8499790 these times require more than a good solider they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need
8499791 can relate to the kind of struggles that people in america and in colorado are feeling right now
8499792 hillary clinton could not have delivered a more genuine and impassioned message as to why this country needs barack obama as president of the united states
8499793 hes a brilliant speaker his rhetoric is fabulous he really is inspirational
8499794 he has to convince people he has a plan for the economy he has to get in the weeds
8499795 thats what kennedy did with khrushchev thats what reagan did with gorbachev thats what nixon did with mao i mean think about it
8499796 john mccains ad is another dishonest and desperate attack that bears zero relationship to reality
8499797 fate history and everything else will be on the line
8499798 its on his shoulders its important for barack obama to take it to john mccain
8499799 together vice president cheney donald rumsfeld and john mccain brought more than a century of experience to our foreign policy challenges and what did that get us one international debacle after another
8499800 we deserve better than john mccains jokes about bombing iran or his denials that iraq has distracted us from afghanistan
8499801 we deserve better than a foreign policy thats more confrontational than george w bush and fails to address the complex challenges of a changing world we need leaders who recognize both our national interest and our shared challenges who will pay attention to both allies and enemies and who will truly make america safer and stronger i can think of none better than barack obama and joe biden
8499802 koolaid drinkers messiah worshipers obamniacs obamafools and a continuing list of other dehumanizing labels intended to diminish ones opinions as invalid
8499803 were not red states or blue states but the united states
8499804 my big fat pilonidal cyst kept me out of vietnam drug addict
8499805 dont kid yourself if you vote for john mccain not only are you not a democrat youre supporting the party that is actively trying to end democracy in this country
8499806 its not so bad to have a dictator as long as im the dictator
8499807 when joe biden s brother and son wanted to buy a hedge fund company two years ago they turned for financing to a law firm that had lobbied the delaware senator s office on an important piece of business in congress
8499808 it was only natural that we worked with my friend beau biden and his firm
8499809 she cant manage her own house how can she manage white house
8499810 no self respecting woman should wish or work for the success of a party that ignores her sex
8499811 sometimes you have to destroy the party to save it
8499812 magical carpet ride rise up through the smoke and the pillars of babylon
8499813 you really should be proud of yourself i mean i would of never of guessed you had it
8499814 its so awesome it gets three smileys in a row how awesome is that lol hehe
8499815 in general i think having solo practitioner specialists is not a good practice
8499816 our biggest problem is theres a small group of doctors in corner brook who dont want any of these services in stephenville
8499817 what i would say to those doctors is youd better be pretty careful because youre playing with peoples lives
8499818 if this surgeon leaves hell leave because hes being hassled or this kind of negative publicity being generated from these few narrow minded doctors who dont want anything out here in stephenville
8499819 why dont they agree to come out here and do some surgery out here
8499820 in the paper there a while ago they were all concerned about the surgical units in corner brook
8499821 i think ken jenkins and his people have been very diligent in working to ensure we have a good health care system here in western newfoundland and theyre constantly being undermined by some of these narrow minded individuals
8499822 while there are not currently major concerns about the quality of surgical services offered in stephenville the increased risk and the high cost of a low volume service makes continuation current configuration of surgical services economically infeasible for this region
8499823 surgical procedures requiring general or regional anesthesia should not be performed at the sir thomas roddick hospital
8499824 this surgeon in corner brook and i have an idea who it is has been anti sir thomas roddick forever
8499825 zet je boodschap op zoveel mogelijk plekken neer om zo zoveel mogelijk mensen te bereiken plaats de advertentie op een plek waar het niet kan worden gemist en herhaal dezelfde boodschap zo vaak mogelijk
8499826 they are confiscating the means for us to do our work
8499827 the tampa incident entered australias history books as a blight on our human rights record seven years ago this week and yet we still have not taken responsibility for the impact it has had on innocent people
8499828 australia likes to think of itself as a compassionate just society but the fact is that we have failed our international obligations to refugees in the past
8499829 we have a duty to assist people affected by their time spent locked up in the system even if they are no longer detained
8499830 i will be using my role on the committee to ensure that this issue is not ignored any longer
8499831 we must restore our respect for human rights and urgently attend to those suffering the long term effects and psychological scarring caused by treatment in detention and particularly children
8499832 the abcc represents the howard governments work choices agenda at its most extreme and yet the rudd government has dragged its heels in addressing these injustices
8499833 well the greens are not prepared to sit back while this travesty of justice continues
8499834 if the rudd labor party wont deliver on the election hopes of working australians for a return to balance in workplace relations then the greens will step in and show them how its done
8499835 its time to act to restore workers rights in the workplace
8499836 if kevin rudd was truly committed to bringing fairness back to australian workplaces then he has no excuse for keeping the abcc one minute longer let alone preserving it until 2010
8499837 it is an affront to our democracy to have workplace relations laws that take away the right to silence deny people their choice of lawyer provide powers to compel evidence with the possibility of gaol for non compliance and impose severe restrictions on the rights of workers to organise and bargain collectively
8499838 i expect alp senators and members to carefully consider this bill and realise that this is the right thing to do it is unfair to put building workers through another couple of years of the oppressive star chamber tactics of the abcc
8499839 i hope they feel extremely uncomfortable being faced with a bill that actually delivers on their un kept promises for a fair industrial relations system in this country
8499840 this movie has a lot romantic scenes and its very frustating to act in my husbands direction
8499841 la nostra condotta politica oggi di un partito di opposizione ma si contraddistingue per la seriet e la coerenza verso i nostri elettori
8499842 pur esprimendo apprezzamento e condivisione per la posizione espressa dal sen viespoli rispetto alle considerazioni pronunciate nei giorni scorsi dal sottosegretario bertolaso e dal ministro gelmini sul sud italia deve far rilevare allo stesso che purtroppo queste posizioni sono largamente diffuse nel governo di cui egli fa parte
8499843 purtroppo prosegue nel suo commento il segretario provinciale delludc da parte di molti rappresentanti dellattuale governo nazionale esiste un vero e proprio pregiudizio negativo sul popolo meridionale e sulla classe dirigente espressa da questa parte del paese in questottica continua santamaria al di l delle generiche rassicurazioni fornite da parte di rappresentanti meridionali del governo da guardare con particolare preoccupazione lintroduzione del sistema di federale fiscale e evidente che da parte di alcuni rappresentanti del governo con questo sistema si punta in qualche modo a penalizzare il sud italia la tesi dalla quale si parte sostiene santamaria e che essendo i meridionali per la maggior parte irresponsabili e menefreghisti in questi anni abbiano approfittato del pubblico denaro prelevato per la maggior parte dai contribuenti settentrionali sperperandolo in vari modi
8499844 sono convinto che prosegue santamaria come sostiene viespoli c necessit di avviare una stagione di responsabilit e di rigore e che questa debba essere vissuta con la stessa intensit dal nord al sud del paese in questo senso il sistema di federalismo fiscale potrebbe rappresentare un giusto pungolo per responsabilizzare la classe dirigente territoriale ad evitare sperperi inutili ovviamente tutto ci deve avvenire indistintamente al nord come al sud del paese mi auguro conclude santamaria che i rappresentanti meridionali del governo al momento opportuno sapranno difendere scontrandosi nei fatti se necessario la parte sana e produttiva del nostro territorio evitando che il sud venga ulteriormente penalizzato
8499845 la decisi n de rusia pone en duda su actuaci n por paz y seguridad en el c ucaso
8499846 we prefer at this point not to put definite timelines on it because it depends on our receiving certain kinds of information and engineering assessments things we dont have full control over in terms of the timing
8499847 but we will be completing the plan as soon as we acquire all the data and information that we need in order to formulate it
8499848 i think it would be reasonable to assume that plan should be completed and the public consultation process should begin some time in this school year
8499849 the intent of this is to prepare students for the workplace
8499850 its governments and the districts response to the prospect of more demands in our province for skilled trades these programs are designed for students of all ability levels for girls and boys and have already begun to stimulate interest and excitement with our schools
8499851 students from outside the corner brook area who wish to live off campus are facing incredibly low vacancy rates
8499852 as long as its a rental in the corner brook and surrounding area whether thats down the bay or in deer lake we will advertise that listing for free
8499853 we contact local landlords who have advertised elsewhere in the city and ask them if they want to advertise with us
8499854 this wasnt a big issue last year but it certainly is a big problem this year and were not sure why that is
8499855 in fact last year there were even some spaces available at grenfell for our students
8499856 im not sure what were going to do but we want to help our students we may need to do more advertisement to look for more accommodations
8499857 people are waiting for their student loans to be processed before they start looking at that point its simply too late it can be mid to the end of july before they hear approval of your student loan and by then the apartments are gone
8499858 i think the biggest thing that could help us improve our service to students and to help the situation would be to have people contacting us and letting us know they have an apartment to rent or rooms to let so we can refer them to our students
8499859 its important to us the landlord has a good experience because a happy landlord means happy tenants
8499860 our history shows us that we are survivors but as we think of creating the new jerusalem for our children and our childrens children we must be clear that mere physical survival is not enough
8499861 what is more to the point as we take command of our own economic and social destiny we must also ensure the survival of civility and of strong cultural traditions that inform a distinct identity the survival of neighbourliness and of a caring and sharing society the survival of shared community values of hardihood and honesty and independence and hard work and the survival of what is a very special newfoundland characteristic the ability even in the hardest of times to see the funny side of life and to be ever ready to take up the arms of humour against a sea of troubles
8499862 he was the dean of arts and science during the time that i attended memorial university and he was admired and appreciated by all who dealt with him
8499863 he was especially appreciated for the extensive time he devoted to patiently mentoring students clearly something he loved to do he shaped many a life in this province and newfoundland and labrador is stronger because of the outstanding work he did both at our university and in the community at large
8499864 dr harris will always be remembered in this province as one of the great presidents of our university and we sincerely look forward to seeing an individual of his calibre lead memorial in the future
8499865 i deeply respected him as a historian and as a person
8499866 i think of him as somebody who was immensely learned about newfoundland history and was also very much connected to his family which was an old st johns family but which was an outport family as well
8499867 i think that that very much shaped his views of newfoundland history and indeed of the future as well
8499868 he was a very good teacher and had a remarkable impact on the university
8499869 more importantly i think he had an impact as a kind of public person of the university because he was very involved in major commissions obviously the northern cod stocks research was critically important
8499870 he was a person who let the leaders who worked for him lead in their own field i wouldnt describe him as hands off but rather a person who drew the best out of the people who worked with him
8499871 he always provided wise counsel i think the most important thing for us was that dr harris really did embody the values that we in the harris center try to live up to
