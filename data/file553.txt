5530000 is it wrong to incur and then use the hate ridden vengeful stupidity of complete strangers in random usenet froups to further my art
5530001 freedom is only a concept like race its merely a social construct that doesnt really exist outside of your ability to convince others of its relevancy
5530002 next time slow up a lil then maybe you wont jump the gun and start creamin yer panties before its time to pop the champagne proper
5530003 people are pretty fucking high on themselves if they think that theyre just born with a soul snicker yeah like theyre just givin em out for free
5530004 quible quible said the hare quite a lot of quibling everywhere so the hare took a long stare and decided at best to leave the rest to their merry little mess
5530005 theres a difference between bad and so earth shatteringly horrible it makes the angels scream in terror as they violently rip their heads off their blood spraying into the faces of a thousand sweet innocent horrified children who will forever have the terrible images burned into their tiny little minds
5530006 how sad that youre such a poor judge of style that you cant even properly gauge the artistic worth of your own efforts
5530007 i am the living embodiment of hell itself in all its tormentive rage endless suffering unfathomable pain and unending horror but you dont get sent to me i come for you

5530010 apparently this group has got the market cornered on stupid
5530011 warren also decided to press his proposal to have an emergency fund to care for orphans and decided to give them a heads up but he was only able to reach obama with that question partly because mccain arrived late ross says at around 5 20 pm pacific
5530012 so it was a level playing field except obama had the extra intel of that question
5530013 do i wear the blue necktie or the red necktie

5530022 mark haysman is a proven manager of people and brands with a strong customer and sponsorship focus in the highly competitive national brewing market
5530023 this makes him the ideal person to be the third chief executive of the port adelaide football club in the afl
5530024 i am excited at the prospect of working with the club and its people as we take on the challenge to continue to grow
5530025 we are going to send the message that we are not going to allow russia to draw a new line at those states that are not yet integrated into the transatlantic structures like georgia and ukraine
5530026 its a ministerial meeting on the georgian crisis so it is normal that she is there
5530027 we dont want to hear that mikheil saakashvili is a saint
5530028 i think youll see a nato more united than you might expect
5530029 the foreign ministers will also probably send a message of solidarity and will agree on a package of measures
5530030 including the international mechanism to monitor respect of the engagements taken by both sides
5530031 audacity of hope he says something of value this time
5530032 we will export our revolution throughout the world and must abandon all idea of not doing so for not only does islam refuse to recognize any difference between muslim countries it is the champion of all oppressed people
5530033 there are several industries we have looked at that are having labour shortage crisis issues and these are all industries that timor can gain skills from
5530034 what we have proposed is 300 employees and trainees in the first pilot year and we are also requesting 100 occupational trainees
5530035 timor would certainly benefit from the fact that we have such a large youth unemployed and unskilled so called bubble
5530036 these people guest workers certainly would assist in timors national and human security recovery and development
5530037 the key problem here is that we have a government that turns around and says we need to bring in 2 500 guest workers as part of a pilot program but then refuses to detail any other information
5530038 is it too much to ask for a full costing is it too much for the government to actually put in place the parameters and the policy decisions that need to be made as to how this scheme will operate
5530039 there are many parts of the tourism industry that are looking for workers
5530040 yet for some inexplicable reason the labor party says the horticultural industry can have workers but the tourism industry cant
5530041 we need some clear and specific policy parameters before the opposition can determine whether or not we will support this
5530042 thirty years ago 20 years ago we were the fruit pickers
5530043 we were the cotton chippers we did all this rural work we were the unskilled labourers in the rural industry
5530044 we created a false economy and then people got used to the idea of staying at home rather than actually going out and looking for work
5530045 and they did travel they used to move down to mildura they used to go out to moree they used to go all these areas doing the fruit picking doing the cotton chipping
5530046 the extension of the quarantining of welfare payments needs to be extended into the dole payments as well
5530047 how can an untruth ever prove another lie to be in error
5530048 in view of certain developments a decision has been taken that fiji will not attend the forum meeting in niue
5530049 this regrettable and unfortunate situation of fiji not participating in the forum meeting in niue arises because of the decision taken by the government of new zealand
5530050 his attendance was expected and there is no reason he should not do so
5530051 commodore bainimarama had the opportunity through his attendance at the forum to explain this decision in person to pacific leaders
5530052 fiji will still be despite his absence a major feature of leaders discussions in niue
5530053 that commodore bainimarama should meet his solemn commitment to hold elections by march next year
5530054 he is trying it on here the bottom line is that there is no forum event in new zealand
5530055 trying to blame new zealand for something that doesnt exist is nonsense
5530056 some pacific countries have arranged to have bilateral meetings here that is entirely their business
5530057 the pacific forum needs to understand that we in fiji will decide what is in our national interest in the short and the long term
5530058 it is very well for the new zealand prime minister to call for unity of the pacific forum on the issue of elections in fiji
5530059 this so called unity cannot be against fiji as that is neither achievable nor acceptable
5530060 most if not all pacific island leaders are against fiji being further victimised by australia and new zealand even if they may not say so openly in niue
5530061 according to the independent electoral commission it will take at least another 12 to 15 months to prepare for election
5530062 interest rate reductions will in time boost confidence and then construction activity but thats a 2009 2010 story
5530063 we have a relatively inelastic supply side so no immediate bounce is expected and this is bad news particularly for those searching for affordable rental housing
5530064 i will be supporting the removal of abortion from the crimes act i think thats the right thing its the right thing in terms of public policy
5530065 but i would stress that the proposal we are putting to the parliament is one that would be consistent and fully consistent with current clinical practice
5530066 for women i think its a crucial matter for them that a personal decision theyve made about themselves and their body is subject to action under the criminal code
5530067 removing this from the criminal code is important for women it is something that many women and many womens organisations have fought long and hard for so i think its important
5530068 today the rights of the unborn children have been forsaken by the victorian government this is a very very sad event
5530069 i dont want women any more to feel that this is some kind of terrible shame
5530070 interestingly this morning all the emails that i have been getting are from women in my age group who underwent similar sort of circumstances themselves and i think its really important to bring down that taboo
5530071 if it is that the bill reflects the second of the third options as reflected in the paper then i will oppose it
5530072 crowing about the fact that someone reads my blag because it makes me feel good
5530073 in what logical order did god plan his redemptive acts
5530074 in reality by this system men are consigned to perdition before they sin and without a cause except it be by the sovereign will of god

5530077 ben wanted a bigger job and he was using the prospect of going to google as a hammer
5530078 but he was not doing a good enough job with what he had been running to make such demands
5530079 i have huge respect for elliot and work well with him
5530080 facebook is a tremendous organization and i would not leave it if it were not for a great opportunity
5530081 facebook confirms that ben ling will be leaving the company in the coming weeks to pursue other interests we wish him well and appreciate his great contributions to the early success of facebook platform
5530082 how could he guarantee that someone was not going to find out and then he would have had to tell a lie about his plans
5530083 especially given facebook is the leakiest place in the valley
5530084 he insinuated he was going to talk badly about all of us and we did not want to deal with him acting like that
5530085 why they didnt give him some credit for his work and align his interests with theirs by being more generous is a mystery to all of us
5530086 his fall from grace makes you think anyone could go from valued employee to bum pretty quickly
5530087 ben is a really smart guy and google is probably a better place for him
5530088 he will probably do well but he did not do well here
5530089 por que todo lo que buscamos no lo encontramos solo aparece aquello que es extra o para nosotros
5530090 this is a simple procedure you might have seen it done elsewhere on a few scarce weblogs what is different is that when we reach a certain point on the list we start yet another one instead of one master list and its done we will repeat the process over and over again with new folks jumping on board these backlinks combined with the social networking friends status will affect all areas of search engine algorithims
5530091 for me it was a good opportunity and maybe when i look back after a few years i will be proud of it
5530092 not everybody can go on the cover of playboy i did it because i am confident of my body and myself it wasnt a group decision we havent seen each other the shooting was separate everyone decided it for themselves
5530093 shes thoughtful and not the least bit full of herself
5530094 were used to it whether domestically or internationally we have dancing girls with us
5530095 people are frustrated and apprehensive and are saying what can we do to make it right
5530096 it is up to us the four nations people we need to work together to come up with a long term solutions against the gangs the drugs and the violence but our community has to take charge
5530097 these communities have to recognize that they have a problem with some of these young people that are out there with their gang ties and this lifestyle with drugs and the violence and they can go home to grandma and grandma will accept them and love them unconditionally kamins said
5530098 well the grandmas and other community leaders have to stop and say wait a minute
5530099 the hardened criminals and the entrenched gang members are committing these crimes and they are committing violence and they are hurting the community terribly
5530100 we have to balance that on the other hand with the fact that we have a lot of people involved in gangs who may be rehabilitated
5530101 they are our people they are our children they are our community members our relatives and it may look simple and easy from someone on the outside but to us it isnt that simple
5530102 i am here to tell you today as chief of samson cree nation we are going to reclaim our youth and foster security within our community these young people are our future
5530103 we are doing what we can to get the gangs out of our community
5530104 beats the intel atom 230 in energy consumption and processing power
5530105 we want to see how frequent this occurs what steps might be taken do all judges approach this in the same way those kinds of things
5530106 obviously what needs to prevail here is the safety of the child
5530107 the only defence that child had was the law which is designed to defend her and the court who has an obligation to uphold that law
5530108 i suggest to you that the judge in this instance failed that child miserably but also failed in her duty as a judicial officer
5530109 i think somebody should be looking into what happened in this particular case
5530110 but whats more important is changing the rules going forward so you always have a criminal background check so that you always have proper representation for the child
5530111 responsible for all legal policy and administrative support to the operation of the court system in ontario
5530112 for the domestically driven investment driven sectors such as the steel sector we see these businesses performing well
5530113 having just spent time in beijing in interaction with our customers over the past week they absolutely support this outlook
5530114 there is clearly some divergence between china the main drive of materials demand and the rest of the world
5530115 the shorter term outlook in the more middle class more finished good oriented metals such as nickel and particularly aluminium appear somewhat weaker

5530119 still working hard to ensure compatibility between the guitar hero and rock band titles currently on the market and we hope to have an announcement on that shortly
5530120 somewhat surprising to us that ea agreed to change its offer from hostile to friendly
5530121 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5530122 already there are advocates saying that injection sites are not enough that government should hand out heroin for free
5530123 others are now calling for inhalation rooms for people who smoke their drugs while i support various aspects of harm reduction i believe that we have to draw the line somewhere with regard to these kinds of measures
5530124 is it ethical for health care professionals to support the administration of drugs that are of unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed
5530125 in this way the supervised injection site undercuts the ethics of medical practice and sets a debilitating example for all physicians and nurses both present and future in canada who might begin to question whether its ok to allow someone to overdose under their care
5530126 we specifically take issue with the minister using that phrase
5530127 the minister was off base in calling into question the ethics of physicians involved in harm reduction
5530128 its clear that this was being used as a political issue
5530129 i found the use of medical ethics to justify a political decision which will affect social policy to be troubling at best and misleading at worst
5530130 ethics consist of a balancing of rights and harms as do all medical decisions that physicians in this room help their patients reach every day iv drug users as the rest of us have the right to compassion and to access and care which has proven to be beneficial
5530131 there is not enough evidence for who to provide global guidance to member states on safe injection facilities
5530132 we have to do more to reach out to our own sons and daughters who are overdosing in the downtown eastside
5530133 they need our compassion and they need our intervention not help simply to shoot up
5530134 we know that if people have a safe place that they can talk to people that they eventually will come off drugs they eventually will get help and that they dont die
5530135 this guy clement is insulting physicians and the nurses that are working hard in the trenches of helping people get off drugs
5530136 there were severe flash floods last year that seemed to affect pockets but this hit all of northern ireland
5530137 larry can you be any more of a yankee apologist just look past your yankee myopia and try some objectivity
5530138 wow larry youve produced 25 of the comments on this thread and said nothing meaningful thats impressive even for you
5530139 after reading all your postings and daily weblog i believe you have truly become the phil pepe of this generation now this is not necessarily a good thing
5530140 you blog sucks it reeds as it was written by the queer son of mike lupica and roids clemens i could write a better column by letting a monkey fuk a typewriter i dont need no 181 million dollar team to write a blog fukkk the spankeees

5530144 behind the world food crisis is a global freshwater crisis expected to rapidly worsen as climate change impacts intensify
5530145 irrigation fed agriculture provides 45 per cent of the worlds food supplies and without it we could not feed our planets population of six billion people
5530146 millions of people depend on freshwater fisheries as a major food source
5530147 freshwater food stocks can provide up to 80 per cent of dietary protein for the 60 million people of the mekong basin for example and thats just one river
5530148 freshwater systems are home to around 40 per cent of all the species on earth
5530149 and our impact is shown by the fact that we are losing these species faster than any other
5530150 a global treaty for co operatively managing rivers and lakes that cross or form borders is still languishing in limbo more than a decade after being approved by a clear majority in the united nations
5530151 water management for human needs alone is damaging the natural systems we all depend on
5530152 no management is even worse health of freshwater ecosystems has to become one of the major aims of freshwater management generally
5530153 we are also concerned that the world continues to mainly discuss adaption to climate change rather than doing it
5530154 we have been doing it all over the world and we have found that that improving the
5530155 it is ironic that currently it is not foresight and planning but major natural disasters that lead to significant efforts to repair damaged rivers and wetlands foresight and planning now will reduce the risk and damage from future extreme weather events while having many economic social and environmental benefits
5530156 even this tiny proportion however would be enough for humans to live on earth if the water cycle was properly functioning and if we managed our water use wisely
5530157 the babies have actually made me more ambitious i feel all this newfound inspiration
5530158 ive always loved sports i used to be on a track team in school and thats probably why i can think to myself now yeah i can do this which is totally crazy the team was a big part of my life back then and taught me so many things when i look back on my life and what im able to do its partly because of that early training it taught me discipline how to be committed about striving to win stamina all that good stuff
5530159 i dont expect to win this race my goal is to finish ill probably end up crawling across the finish line but ill do it

5530182 is an enumerated power granted to congress under article 1 section 8 of the constitution it is not it is a general statement describing the section content and justifying the need to levy taxes
5530183 the congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes duties imposts and excises to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the united states but all duties imposts and excises shall be uniform throughout the united states
5530184 to declare war grant letters of marque and reprisal and make rules concerning captures on land and water
5530185 to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers and all other powers vested by this constitution in the government of the united states or in any department or officer thereof
5530186 very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
5530187 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5530188 the city is a cold place now people are fearful
5530189 i am sure that such a well conducted effective peacemaking operation aimed at protecting our citizens and other people will be among the most glorious deeds of the russian military
5530190 the world realized that even now there are political freaks who were ready to kill innocent people for the sake of political fashions and who compensated for their own stupidity by eliminating a whole nation
5530191 i think the russians will pull out but will damage georgia strongly
5530192 georgia will survive but russia has lost its credibility in the eyes of the world
5530193 does not apply to civilians working for federal departments or agencies other than dod the department of defense
5530194 safe and secure nuclear energy nuclear power represents more than 70 percent of our noncarbon generated electricity it is unlikely that we can meet our aggressive climate goals if we eliminate nuclear power as an option however before an expansion of nuclear power is considered key issues must be addressed including security of nuclear fuel and waste waste storage and proliferation
5530195 i would not have nominated clarence thomas i dont think that he i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation of a lot of the constitution
5530196 ninety per cent of the work is convincing people that the eyes are real
5530197 the subtlety of the timing of eye movements is a big one people also have a natural asymmetry for instance in the muscles in the side of their face those types of imperfections arent that significant but they are what makes people look real
5530198 theres always been control systems for different facial movements but say in the past you had a dial for controlling whether an eye was open or closed and in one frame you set the eye at 3 4 open the next 1 2 open etc this is like achieving that degree of control with much finer movements
5530199 for instance you could be controlling the movement in the top 3 4mm of the right side of the smile
5530200 there came a point where animators were trying to create a face and there was a theory of diminishing returns
5530201 if youre trying to process the graphics in a photo realistic animation in real time theres a lot of computation involved
5530202 it is highly ironic that assembly democrats put up a budget plan that would increase spending by 2 billion just days after voting down in committee a republican budget reform proposal which would limit annual state spending assembly constitutional amendment 19
5530203 balancing the state budget this year will be an empty gesture if we fail to fix what is essentially a broken system aca 19 would restrict spending growth and place excess revenue in a rainy day fund to be used during future fiscal crises and to pay down state debt it is a common sense measure and i am sorry my democrat colleagues are not committed to getting the states long term budget problems under control
5530204 i voted against the budget put forward by assembly democrats because it is the height of irresponsibility to increase health and welfare spending by more than 6 percent when the state faces a 15 billion deficit the budget is now more than 7 weeks overdue it is time to get serious and pass a budget that californians deserve
5530205 my colleagues and i have stated for months that we will not vote for any budget proposal that raises taxes
5530206 yet with 400 000 jobs lost since year democrats continue to call for tax increases instead of punishing families the legislature needs to prioritize spending and cut out the waste
5530207 i feel that we have to have priorities in our budget
5530208 the democrats want to cut spending in one area public safety yet they insist on increasing spending on programs benefiting illegal immigrants with priorities like this its no wonder our state is over 15 billion in the red
5530209 ive still got a rather lengthy amount of time before i decide anything
5530210 the pendulum is swinging very heavily in the direction of it just being over ive never sat around and not gotten ready to head to florida well not in 23 or so years anyway so to me that will likely be the last real test for me and whether or not i want to put the time and effort into getting after it one more time
5530211 next i started thinking about the original plan of pitching the 2nd half of next season thing is that urgency just is not there i miss some things i didnt think i would and dont miss many things
5530212 there are standards to be a member of this basketball program and laurynas has not lived up to those standards

5530217 you cant have a plan that just says were holding secret meetings and our question is just what the hell does that mean
5530218 there is no clear and obvious movement forward in the negotiating process by august 25
5530219 has not up to this point been viewed as something the parties feel would facilitate an agreement
5530220 take nothing away and least of all should fool people out of something as if it were nothing
5530221 to fool people out of something as if it were nothing
5530222 objections against christianity come from insubordination unwillingness to obey rebellion against all authority
5530223 the misfortune of our age in the political as well as in the religious sphere and in all things is disobedience unwillingness to obey and one deceives oneself and others by wishing to make us imagine that it is doubt no it is insubordination
5530224 the attitude of those who willingly suffer everything for their unquestioned faith and who obediently commit atrocities for it too

5530238 the sedative effects of ambien may be stronger in older adults accidental falls are common in elderly patients who take sedatives use caution to avoid falling or accidental injury while you are taking ambien
5530239 ambien should only be taken when you have a window of seven to eight hours for sleep
5530240 your staff should know that youve taken the medication and that you should not be involved in any decision making during that time
5530241 it may not be the best idea for the commander in chief to be under the influence when he or she may have to make a snap decision regarding national security in the middle of the night hillarys so called telephone call at 3 00 a m
5530242 there are some flaws here a plot that could have been tightened an over reliance on adjectives and adverbs to bolster dialogue but this dark romance seeps into the soul
5530243 twilight is far from perfect bellas appeal is based on magic rather than character
5530244 t shirts well adam and eve were naked so we came up with that creativity and they wore the shirts that said that and a lot of other people made those too

5530247 placed its whole case for murder on a 16 year old who had consumed 80 ounces of malt liquor who had a view from a darkened park across a darkened roadway
5530248 is that it were going to hang him on that
5530249 isnt it a little late for you to be out

5530253 any political transition in pakistan will have no effect on pakistans nuclear assets because it has a very strong custodial control
5530254 the reality is that pakistans government exists on different levels one of the levels it exists and works at is in the control of its nuclear weapons
5530255 where it does not work is in providing effective services jobs education and health that people need
5530256 pakistans nuclear arsenal is in the hands of the army and the army is not changing hands so whatever the situation was before is largely what it will continue to be
5530257 if pakistan becomes a more fragile and even failing state then the nuclear assets will be everybodys problem internationally the best way to prevent that from happening is in strengthening the new governments ability to govern

5530262 dulu di suatu tempat di jawa barat ada orang tepatnya gelandangan mati dengan bahagia senyuman damai dan rasa yang sangat tenang
5530263 pokoknya bahagia lah walau mati tanpa sepeser uangpun dengan tubuh kaku senyumnya damai dan hanya ada secarik halaman koran ditangan kanannya
5530264 gini ceritanya bro bapak yang kurus kering luntang lantung dan sebatangkara itu diakhir hidupnya tahu bahwa masih ada orang yang sangat peduli padanya walau ia tak pernah mengenalnya
5530265 hebatnya ada foto dirinya dan berita tentang dia di koran yang digenggamnya berita tersebut terbit pada hari yang sama dengan tanggal kematiannya
5530266 satu hari sebelum meninggal pak tua bertemu dengan temanku yang juga wartawan itu saat mencari jalan pintas dan lewat didepan gubug reotnya tiba tiba kawanku berhenti dan keinginannya untuk ngobrol muncul walau ia sendiri tak tahu dorongan itu entah datang darimana karena yang jelas dia sudah terbiasa melihat kemiskinan di lorong lorong kota itu
5530267 pak tua menceritakan tentang dirinya yang terlepas dari akar keluarganya ia berasal dari timur negeri ini tak punya siapa siapa lagi dan tak bisa pulang karena tak ada ongkos anaknya yang lebih dulu merantau dicarinya tak ketemu ketemu juga pak tua juga cerita mengenai kerjaannya yang serabutan tentang perutnya yang sering keram dan maag akutnya tentang beberapa hari yang tak makan karena sakit keras dan tak kuat bekerja
5530268 memang klise dan cerita lama sih bung tapi endingnya yang bikin aku sedih setahun terakhir ini pak tua bekerja keras hanya untuk bisa pulang kampung dan berkumpul dengan orang orang yang dicintainnya biar ada yang ngerawat kalau dia sakit keras nanti hanya itu keinginannya
5530269 lalu cerita kemiskinan pak tua itu ditulis oleh rekan wartawanku yang menganggap cerita itu setidaknya bisa mengalirkan rupiah kepada pak tua yang sakit keras sebatang kara dan tak makan itu kemudia cerita haru yang menyempil sedikit dalam halaman koran itu terbit keesokan harinya
5530270 kawan wartawanku yang menulis itu bahagia banget membaca tulisannya dikoran hari itu dia pikir paling tidak bisa masuk rumah sakit dan makan gratis sampai sembuh si pak tua intinya hari itu dia banyak senyum karena kemungkinan pak rt rw atau pak camat dikawasan pak tua pasti ingin menunjukkan kepedulian kepada warganya
5530271 sampai sore saja kebahagiaan itu bro saat ada kabar dari pedonor yang telpon ke kantornya bahwa saat disambangi ke gubugnya pak tua sudah meninggal di dalam gubug dengan secarik koran dan senyum teduh dimukanya
5530272 kita selalu menjalani hari tapi tak pernah bisa menyempurnakannya kita selalu bermimpi tentang indahnya hari esok tapi tak sempat menemukannya
5530273 what the children who have been victims of violence and abuse will make of all of this in the future we cannot know
5530274 but they will surely wonder why a feminist of such fame as greer has come to the defence of those who destroyed their innocence and damaged their sense of self
5530275 we are not in the mood for failed leftist excuses for the rising levels of homicide femicide and suicide
5530276 dr greers panoply of protest slogans deployed as social theory was dismissed long ago by the research and policy community as incapable of explaining the present day levels of huge disparities in life expectancy morbidity and mortality rates and other socio economic indicators
5530277 while the burden of history is acknowledged in much of this work the everyday suffering in communities at risk is caused by a multiplicity of factors all more complicated than dr greer would have us understand
5530278 i think its quite presumptuous to say that you know what is happening in the minds of aboriginal men
5530279 all im saying is that unless we deal with the pathology that underlies it we wont get anywhere
5530280 we wont actually stop the violence we may even cause it to escalate

5530297 the people who voted for me wanted this so i am going forward with it at town meeting instead
5530298 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context
5530299 thats pretty astonishing since there seems to be absolutely no basis for the charge
5530300 the new york times makes bill kristol look even stupider than usual
5530301 thats pretty astonishing since there seems to be absolutely no basis for the charge
5530302 internet search i know were looking at about 30 seconds in realtime either way and kristoltime is money so his failure to do either a or b can you thumb your nose at the times any more than that

5530313 most working families today do not have homes that have anywhere near ten rooms john mccain has ten houses many working people in america have to work two and three jobs to provide for their families and pay their car loans john mccain hops on a private jet is it any wonder why mccain champions a george bush agenda of cutting taxes for corporations and the wealthy helping oil companies turn record profits and leaving working families to fend for themselves mccains velvet world leaves him utterly unprepared to make the tough choices we need to restore the middle class and ensure that everyone in america has quality affordable health insurance

5530426 monetization of online video continues to be critically important to all video producers

5530429 we have to deny russian strategic objectives which are clearly to undermine georgias democracy to use its military capability to damage and in some cases destroy georgian infrastructure and to try and weaken the georgian state
5530430 we are not going to allow russia to draw a new line at those states that are not yet integrated into the trans atlantic structures
5530431 to clearly indicate that we are not accepting a new line
5530432 is a very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
5530433 this is not something that is just cost free nobody needs russian strategic aviation along americas coast
5530434 an explanation from the russians for why the russian president either wont or cant keep his word
5530435 we are not going to allow russia to draw a new line at those states that are not yet integrated into the trans atlantic structures

5530438 this is not something that is just cost free nobody needs russian strategic aviation along americas coast

5530446 it cleans out all the trees it gives people a little work to do and it gets the tourists out of here for a few days
5530447 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5530448 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5530449 ive got a generator and ive got a concrete home that i built myself so i know it can withstand this
5530450 every hurricane that we have we have additional lessons learned and experience
5530451 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5530452 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5530453 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5530454 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority
5530455 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies
5530456 if so many of the peppers we eat in the u s come in from
5530457 very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
5530458 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5530459 the city is a cold place now people are fearful
5530460 i am sure that such a well conducted effective peacemaking operation aimed at protecting our citizens and other people will be among the most glorious deeds of the russian military
5530461 the world realized that even now there are political freaks who were ready to kill innocent people for the sake of political fashions and who compensated for their own stupidity by eliminating a whole nation
5530462 i think the russians will pull out but will damage georgia strongly
5530463 georgia will survive but russia has lost its credibility in the eyes of the world
5530464 any political transition in pakistan will have no effect on pakistans nuclear assets because it has a very strong custodial control
5530465 the reality is that pakistans government exists on different levels one of the levels it exists and works at is in the control of its nuclear weapons
5530466 where it does not work is in providing effective services jobs education and health that people need
5530467 pakistans nuclear arsenal is in the hands of the army and the army is not changing hands so whatever the situation was before is largely what it will continue to be
5530468 if pakistan becomes a more fragile and even failing state then the nuclear assets will be everybodys problem internationally the best way to prevent that from happening is in strengthening the new governments ability to govern
5530469 the board knows exactly the stance of the players the players have said what they had to say it is up to the board to make the decision i am sure everything is going to be looked at
5530470 the end state requirements are not known at programme initiation
5530471 we have to deny russian strategic objectives which are clearly to undermine georgias democracy to use its military capability to damage and in some cases destroy georgian infrastructure and to try and weaken the georgian state
5530472 i think you can expect a strong message to russia
5530473 decisions by nato will be balanced and that responsible forces in the west will give up the total cynicism that has been so evident which is pushing us back to the cold war era

5530480 you cant really forgive someone until your heart toward them is changed
5530481 well we often pray and ask god to help us to forgive another person then we say the words and try to move on but our hearts are still hurt still mad still reeling from the offense
5530482 well i finally asked god the what am i missing question about my family and that night i had a dream in the dream all of my family members were in the ocean drowning bobbing up and down trying to get air one of them would push down on the head of another one in order to raise himself up to get more air then that one would bobble back up and push down on someone elses head in order to get some air i watched in horror as they did this to each other then it occurred to me theyre not so much mean and contemptuous as they are desperate and when i understood that my heart filled up with compassion for them it was only then that i was able to truly forgive them
5530483 the real gift of today for me was not my time at the retreat it is right now sitting and listening to you
5530484 god we agreed to do this together what am i missing
5530485 has it ever occurred to you that jan is way overbooked

5530507 federal government were not even telling you that your laws are unconstitutional were just insisting that you to obey your own laws
5530508 as juga telah mula campur tangan urusan negara mengenai siasatan kes liwat anwar ini memberi kesan kepada politik negara pengundi juga haruslah berfikir mengapa perlu ada pemimpin yang meraih simpati dari luar negara
5530509 pemimpin seperti ini tidak dapat mempengaruhi undi kerana kedua dua mereka pernah tewas dan dipenjarakan macam gus dur dia dijatuhkan suara suara ini tidak dapat mempengaruhi undi dan mereka masih dipengaruhi oleh dasar dan hubungan yang dibuat oleh anwar ketika beliau mempunyai kedudukan
5530510 mereka ini tidak perlu campur tangan usaha mendapatkan sokongan dari luar ini bukan hanya anwar tetapi juga biasa dilakukan oleh pemimpin tertentu
5530511 dengan siapa dia berkawan terpulang pada dia apa yang penting pengundi kena buat perhitungan untuk negara dan diri sendiri
5530512 jika dirasakan antara tiga calon yang bertanding anwar boleh bagi perkhidmatan pada rakyat mereka boleh undi anwar yang penting kita kena tahu yang calon dipilih jujur ikhlas atau ada agenda peribadi
5530513 orang luar tidak tahu apa yang orang tempatan permatang pauh kehendaki hanya mereka yang boleh menjawab persoalan itu
5530514 memanglah pilihan raya kecil permatang pauh ini pertarungan satu lawan satu antara pkr dan bn tiada parti lain
5530515 hangpa dengarlah ceramah anwar asyik sebut dia nak jadi pm nak masuk putrajaya kerusi permatang pauh ni macam batu loncatan pula untuk dia capai matlamatnya bukannya soal masalah penduduk sini hendak diselesaikan dok sibuk nak ke putrajaya
5530516 apa depa penyokong pkr ingat presiden pas datuk seri hadi awang nak tengok cam tu saja dia anwar masuk parlimen terus nak duduk jadi ketua pembangkang
5530517 pendek katalah penyokong pas akan menjadi penentu kemenangan dalam pilihan raya kecil permatang pauh bukan sahaja untuk anwar tetapi juga bn
5530518 mungkin pada selasa depan hari pengundian 26 ogos keputusan dah tak sama macam mac lalu
5530519 itu hal peribadi antara anwar dan individu berkenaan mohd saiful bukhari azlan hari ini kita cerita keburukan orang lain esok lusa mungkin orang akan dedah keburukan kita
5530520 saya tidak menentang anwar bila saya berkawan dengan seseorang saya berkawan hingga ke akhira
5530521 bila saya menemui penduduk permatang pauh ramai bertanyakan pasal dakwaan liwat ini tapi saya serahkan kepada mereka untuk menilainya itu isu peribadi
5530522 dia akan masuk dan terus duduk di kerusi ketua pembangkang yang dikosongkan isterinya saudara saudari selepas duduk beberapa minit tup tap tup tap dengan kenyit matanya 30 orang ahli parlimen bn dari sebelah sana terus masuk ke sini pakatan pembangkang
5530523 what a high school teacher might call a young woman of poise
5530524 recognizing kosovo will bring nothing but trouble no one can be denied the right to self determination but only within the bounds of common sense
5530525 with its irresponsible behavior causing new divisions in europe and globally and undermining international relations
5530526 it is clear and certain after all thats been said and done that kosovo will never but really never be a legal and legitimate independent country
5530527 kosovos independence came about in large part through an arrogant and reckless attitude in washington as well as in some eu capitals that the positions of serbia and russia could simply be ignored

5530533 esto no es un ala pol tica ni un juego pol tico se trata de una verdad de hombres y mujeres cristianos que fundaron esta naci n basados en principios cristianos lo cual est bien documentado en todos nuestros libros por lo tanto es completamente adecuado demostrar nuestra fe cristiana en las paredes de las escuelas si cristo les ofende entonces les sugiero que busquen otra parte del mundo para vivir porque dios y jesucristo son parte de nuestra cultura

5530660 mortgages are down pretty sharply today it seems pretty clear that somehow theyve got to get more capital
5530661 to me it seems like the only end game is for the government to step in even though they said today they have no intention
5530662 i dont know if they wait for the equities to hit some price before they step in at some point theres nothing left

5530668 we regret that formal consultations have not been successful in resolving our concerns over the duties that the eu is imposing on several high tech products
5530669 we believe that these duties are inconsistent with the eus commitments on these products and that they discourage technological innovation in the it sector
5530670 is not something we can negotiate bilaterally with the united states
5530671 in effect the eu is taxing innovation a move that could impair continued technological development in the information technology industry and raise prices for millions of businesses and consumers

5530697 the seizure of a french vessel is an act of hostility or reprisal requiring congressional approval the court held that congress pursuant to constitutional war powers had authorized hostilities on the high seas under certain circumstances
5530698 even an order from the president could not justify or excuse an act that violated the laws and customs of warfare chief justice john marshall wrote that a captain of a united states warship could be held personally liable in trespass for wrongfully seizing a neutral danish ship even though
5530699 the courts position seems consistent with a typical trespass case where defendants are liable even when they have a reasonable good faith but mistaken belief in authority to enter on the plaintiffs land
5530700 a blockade of coastal states that had joined the confederacy at the outset of the civil war the court explicitly ruled that a blockade is an act of war and is legal only if properly authorized under the constitution

5530702 vested in a congress of the united states which shall consist of a senate and house of representatives
5530703 to lay and collect taxes duties imposts and excises to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and welfare of the united states
5530704 make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces
5530705 to declare war grant letters of marque and reprisal and make rules concerning capture on land and water

5530729 fetuses are still developing and their brain cells are starting to grow and starting to reach out to each other if msg has been inhibiting or stunting the growth then the cells basically wont reach out to one another

5530731 this is the first unequivocal evidence to my knowledge that msg has direct effect on neuronal ability i think its very exciting

5530803 when you are trying to preserve anything you are trying to preserve the most important things about that artifact

5530819 the second burglar was a cohort of the man we caught
5530820 dear hans i think you should contact bill gates or something to get your website looked at it makes me sad that we your loyal servants to the arg can not get a bone thrown at us however i think you are onto something because we still all wait in our pods talking and complaining yet we still will bow down the next we can get into your stubborn website namaste dude namaste amy
5530821 what goes around the world but stays in a corner
5530822 i think ive just continued to get better in the preseason in the games and in practice so this will be another step to take
5530823 to come to a decision like that weve taken a lot of things into consideration last year how orton finished the season training camp preseason games
5530824 in the end it comes down to a gut feeling that you have
5530825 completions turnovers to just the feeling we have on who can manage the game the best for us all of things like that
5530826 and the good thing about evaluating both rex and kyle weve had a long time to do it its been quite a few years weve had a chance to see both guys play
5530827 people make such a big deal about that my rookie year and everything but i think everybody on this team has gotten better since they were a rookie and not just me
5530828 that stuffs in the past and im just focused on playing good football now
5530829 my accuracy has improved my command of the offense has improved and just being able to play at a high level
5530830 both guys were in the same situation which is a good part about it
5530831 both guys played both preseason games with the same line i think we did about what we could to let them compete fairly for the position
5530832 i wasnt even sure what the contract situation was to be honest
5530833 no competitor will agree with a decision when it doesnt go their way
5530834 rex is a team player hes been in this situation before and hell do whatever he needs to do to help our football team win
5530835 we dont name any guys starters for lifetime or anything like that but we feel real good about kyle just like we feel good about olin kreutz being our center and lance briggs being our linebacker
5530836 it is kind of frustrating wondering who the starting quarterback is
5530837 thats probably one of the most important players on the team is the quarterback now that weve got it all resolved and we know who the starter is then now we can get down to business
5530838 just because you got passed over dont take it out on me
5530839 do you think sara would ever go out with me
5530840 so i was thinking maybe we could take our break at the same time later this shift together
5530841 i have some information that could bring us even closer
5530842 greg you still have the solo to complete and technically youre still a trainee but youre doing a great job
5530843 sara said you didnt lose your virginity until you were 22
5530844 absolutely 100 percent clear and clean it did not spread they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer
5530845 i was just shaking and and then also immediately i had to go into
5530846 immediately made those appointments and immediately called around for someone to start teaching me how to live macrobiotically
5530847 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5530848 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5530849 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5530850 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5530851 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5530852 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5530853 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5530854 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5530855 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5530856 need to be prepared to deal with families who are waiting for a miracle
5530857 sensitivity to this belief will promote development of a trusting relationship
5530858 when youre a parent and youre standing over the body of your child who you think is dying you have to have that
5530859 i know that none of us are immune from anything
5530860 you cant say thats nonsense you have to respect that
5530861 the mom was playing religious tapes in the room and obviously was very focused on looking for a miracle
5530862 caught her in the side of the head she had no pulse when they pulled her out of the water
5530863 we just cant shut that machine off then you know what we cant shut that machine off
5530864 you might have a family thats having a hard time and it might take another day and thats ok
5530865 what he has done is basically a contempt on his part the accuser has no obligation to swear on the quran unless the court permits it and it should be done in the syariah courts and not a mosque
5530866 what he has done instead was to confirm that he was sodomised thats all
5530867 you only swear on the quran when the court reaches a dead end and the judge wants you to swear on the quran to presume your innocence
5530868 if there is any dispute the disputing party should point out the right way to swear
5530869 you know the parti keadilan rakyat workers just left they came to give their flyers
5530870 but i find anwar too ambitious and i dont like how some of the supporters behave
5530871 he was nice when he was the mp here but keeping the oil price low isnt the only measure of a good leader
5530872 arif is a good man im sure but anwar speaks about our problems he speaks about what we are going through
5530873 heah i lets connect and by the way buy my stuff
5530874 chewing is a bit like eating and it starts peristalsis which is the movement of the bowel
5530875 ileus when the bowel is slow to start working again can occur after an operation but it has become less common as surgery has become more refined
5530876 most people look for what they can get from me i am searching for someone looking for what they can give to me
5530877 being a conduit of glory is not just about bringing heaven to earth but also about collecting the earths goodness and all that it has to offer and giving it back to me
5530878 attention is an act of connection we look from where we are to what is all around us in doing so we discover where we are at the act of paying attention is what brings us peace
5530879 sometimes life is merely a matter of coffee and whatever intimacy a cup of coffee affords
5530880 if we think we have no stories it is because we have not paid enough attention to our lives most of us live lives that are far richer and more meaningful than we appreciate
5530881 i hope the insurgent leaders understand that they are playing around with a dangerous and sensitive demographic area they are playing around with and harming the islamic area
5530882 do not waste time and cause hardships for children and women in the sahara without need
5530883 i hope the world has woken up to what is going on the russians should get out of my country
5530884 the worst thing the world could do would be to compromise and show weakness
5530885 the russians will invent all kinds of excuses pretexts not to pull back their troops
5530886 they will rename themselves peacekeepers maintain their positions in the security zone
5530887 faced with the embarrassing prospect of holding a fundraiser with one of jack abramoffs closest associates the mccain campaign scrambled today to scratch ralph reed from tonights program but voters deserve to know the answers to the real questions raised by reeds involvement
5530888 will senator mccain keep the money reed has raised for him and is reed is a member of the mccain victory 2008 team if the mccain campaign wont return the money reed has raised for them then voters should rightly ask why it matters that reed didnt show up at tonights event the real question isnt why reed isnt showing up but why a so called reformer would invite him at all
5530889 the old john mccain wouldnt have allowed one of jack abramoffs top cronies to raise money for him but this time around its clear that senator mccain is willing to do whatever it takes to win even if that means embracing president bushs policies his tactics and now his disgraced fundraisers
5530890 everybody in this room could be donating to some other cause or to their own well being but i want to thank you

5530892 i hope you will join me and jo anne at the august 18 event in support of senator mccain in atlanta the outcome of this presidential election is going to determine the future direction of this country please join us as we work together to elect john mccain your participation is critical to success

5530906 were not worried about it weve seen this movie before
5530907 there are bad storms and there are nice ones and this is a nice one
5530908 it cleans out all the trees it gives people a little work to do and it gets the tourists out of here for a few days
5530909 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5530910 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5530911 ive got a generator and ive got a concrete home that i built myself so i know it can withstand this
5530912 every hurricane that we have we have additional lessons learned and experience
5530913 this is a broad really diffuse storm all the florida keys and all the florida peninsula are going to feel the effects of this storm no matter where the center makes landfall
5530914 the world has seen that even today there are political morons who are ready to kill innocent and defenseless people in order to satisfy their self serving interests while compensating for their own inability to resolve complicated issues by using the most terrible solution by exterminating an entire people
5530915 i think that there should be no mercy for that we will do our best not to let this crime go unpunished
5530916 you just dont move more than 1 200 tanks and 15 000 soldiers into a country within 12 hours without previous planning
5530917 were talking about pulling our troops away to the borders of south ossetia they will not be on georgia territory
5530918 russians have committed to withdrawing and they need to withdraw and so that is what we are looking for
5530919 we were all set and then the georgians came up with a bunch of new requirements with no time for us to act so the time to exchange prisoners was interrupted
5530920 russian forces continue to consolidate their enclaves in south ossetia and abkhazia
5530921 mounting evidence that russian and georgian military used armed force unlawfully during the south ossetian conflict

5530924 any political transition in pakistan will have no effect on pakistans nuclear assets because it has a very strong custodial control
5530925 the reality is that pakistans government exists on different levels one of the levels it exists and works at is in the control of its nuclear weapons
5530926 where it does not work is in providing effective services jobs education and health that people need
5530927 pakistans nuclear arsenal is in the hands of the army and the army is not changing hands so whatever the situation was before is largely what it will continue to be
5530928 if pakistan becomes a more fragile and even failing state then the nuclear assets will be everybodys problem internationally the best way to prevent that from happening is in strengthening the new governments ability to govern

5530938 rev wright is a great friend preacher and singer who had so much to do with our success my heart goes out to timothy his family and to his church family we are thanking god for his immediate healing strength and total recovery

5530947 the founders of marxism leninism teach that the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat is the only force capable of effecting such a transformation what is the dictatorship of the proletariat it is power in the hands of the working people led by the working class and having as its aim the building of socialism
5530948 the dictatorship of the proletariat is the crux of marxism
5530949 we are thinking about buying a bigger house what are your thoughts on this paul
5530950 what is our objective big picture over the next twenty years
5530951 i went into the shoot expecting the content to make for good television but never realized how much fun id have in the process jeff russ and bob er todd were all amazing to work with and russ wife lisa even allowed us to take complete run of her newly remodeled home
5530952 bless them that curse you and pray for them which despitefully
5530953 i dove in and they filled up with water and it got worse and worse during the race from the 150 meter wall to the finish i couldnt see the wall i was just hoping i was winning
5530954 the race was very physical theyve put in big turn buoys which is not convenient while you go around you get hit and theres a lot of contact my goggles came off twice and i had to stop to fix them
5530955 i have never experienced such a race before i got hit during the second lap because the american leah gingrich suddenly decided to use breaststroke her leg kicked me in the eye knocked my goggles off my head i was swimming with one eye open
5530956 b l a c k i e is still alive
5530957 i wanted to try to get out in the open water and i was in the outside lane so it was kind of difficult for the others to see me i just wanted to get out there and try to hold on
5530958 may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5530959 a completely unsubstantiated obama campaign claim that john mccain somehow cheated
5530960 if peter brown wants to hob knob with karl rove that is his prerogative but attending a republican fundraiser for the explicit purpose of defeating democratic candidates is way over the line at the very least he owes kristi thibaut and sherrie matula an apology and an offer to contribute or raise an equal amount of money for them
5530961 ive still got a rather lengthy amount of time before i decide anything
5530962 the pendulum is swinging very heavily in the direction of it just being over ive never sat around and not gotten ready to head to florida well not in 23 or so years anyway so to me that will likely be the last real test for me and whether or not i want to put the time and effort into getting after it one more time
5530963 next i started thinking about the original plan of pitching the 2nd half of next season thing is that urgency just is not there i miss some things i didnt think i would and dont miss many things

5530971 quien form un dios o quien fundi una imagen que para nada es de provecho
5530972 no te har s imagen ni ninguna semejanza de lo que est arriba en el cielo ni abajo en la tierra ni en las aguas debajo de la tierra
5530973 no te inclinar s a ellas ni las honrar s porque yo soy jehov tu dios fuerte celoso que visito la maldad de los padres sobre los hijos hasta la tercera y cuarta generaci n de los que me aborrecen
5530974 ya que cambiaron la verdad de dios por la mentira honrando y dando culto a las criaturas antes que al creador el cual es bendito por los siglos am n
5530975 qui n form un dios o qui n fundi una imagen que para nada es de provecho
5530976 que tontos son ustedes hacen el ni o jes s puede vestir a s mismo ni se puede arreglar cuando se rompe o cuando se cae de su lugar pero ustedes adoran a esto como dios qu tontos son no lo ven que no es til de nada es de provecho es in til no entienden
5530977 ser n vueltos atr s y en extremo confundidos los que conf an en dolos y dicen a las im genes de fundici n vosotros sois nuestros dioses
5530978 guardad pues mucho vuestras almas pues ninguna figura visteis el d a que jehov habl con vosotros de en medio del fuego corromp is y hag is para vosotros escultura imagen de figura alguna efigie de var n o hembra
5530979 no sea hallado en ti quien haga pasar a su hijo o a su hija por el fuego ni quien practique adivinaci n ni agorero ni sort lego ni hechicero
5530980 porque es abominaci n para con jehov cualquiera que hace estas cosas y por estas abominaciones jehov tu dios echa estas naciones de delante de ti
5530981 a la ley y al testimonio si no dijeren conforme a esto es porque no les ha amanecido
5530982 o sea no hay luz o entendimiento en ellos esto de orar a o comunicarse con los muertos es lo que ense a la iglesia cat lica oficialmente entonces
5530983 por tanto teniendo un gran sumo sacerdote que traspas los cielos jes s el hijo de dios retengamos nuestra profesi n
5530984 porque no tenemos un sumo sacerdote que no pueda compadecerse de nuestras debilidades sino uno que fue tentado en todo seg n nuestra semejanza pero sin pecado

5530991 some people claim that we must vote for mccain because of the future of the scotus but that is not an argument when you think about the republican appointed members of the scotus there now who have been voting against our rights with aplomb their kelo decision for example
5530992 all legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a congress of the united states which shall consist of a senate and house of representatives
5530993 the powers delegated by the proposed constitution to the federal government are few and defined those which are to remain in the state governments are numerous and indefinite the former will be exercised principally on external objects as war peace negotiation and foreign commerce with which last the power of taxation will for the most part be connected the powers reserved to the several states will extend to all the objects which in the ordinary course of affairs concern the lives liberties and properties of the people and the internal order improvement and prosperity of the state
5530994 the operations of the federal government will be most extensive and important in times of war and danger those of the state governments in times of peace and security as the former periods will probably bear a small proportion to the latter the state governments will here enjoy another advantage over the federal government the more adequate indeed the federal powers may be rendered to the national defense the less frequent will be those scenes of danger which might favor their ascendancy over the governments of the particular states
5530995 this government is acknowledged by all to be one of enumerated powers
5530996 the powers delegated by the proposed constitution to the federal government are few and defined
5530997 our jurisprudence has been driven by a practical understanding that in our increasingly complex society replete with ever changing and more technical problems congress simply cannot do its job absent an ability to delegate power under broad general directives

5531003 there are now five strokes the fifth stroke is the underwater dolphin kick
5531004 you are all swimming in a pack and you dont have a lane to yourself so it is a very physical sport and you do swim on top of each other and get the odd fist in the face and that sort of thing
5531005 i was still posing naked in the mirror when i was pregnant thinking i looked hot
5531006 struggle with stage fright and sensitivities about appearing too forward pushy or intrusive
5531007 we are going to send the message that we are not going to allow russia to draw a new line at those states that are not yet integrated into the transatlantic structures like georgia and ukraine
5531008 its a ministerial meeting on the georgian crisis so it is normal that she is there
5531009 we dont want to hear that mikheil saakashvili is a saint
5531010 i think youll see a nato more united than you might expect
5531011 the foreign ministers will also probably send a message of solidarity and will agree on a package of measures
5531012 including the international mechanism to monitor respect of the engagements taken by both sides
5531013 mark haysman is a proven manager of people and brands with a strong customer and sponsorship focus in the highly competitive national brewing market
5531014 this makes him the ideal person to be the third chief executive of the port adelaide football club in the afl
5531015 i am excited at the prospect of working with the club and its people as we take on the challenge to continue to grow
5531016 i think theyve been trying to make me irrelevant for some time but they got in a jam when fletch left us and i had to fill in
5531017 we have a very strong team of meteorologists here and we expect that to continue
5531018 weve got some of best people in the business working here
5531019 were just trying to be careful and keep things in proportion
5531020 looking at it in hindsight we would have done some things differently
5531021 there was no way to determine this at the time because the genetics were not online
5531022 some are truly unknown to us we never found the florida letter
5531023 we are not going to put the suspicions to rest there will always be a spore on the grassy knoll
5531024 well first we are going to get you the best chocolate ever and from there we can go get some dinner and you have loads of great places to choose from
5531025 if you dont want the tree dont plant the seed
5531026 wow it must have been really awesome to go places like california
5531027 mom do you think that i am doing the wrong thing
5531028 anything such as that or any other military equipment that was moved in would be in violation of this cease fire and should be removed immediately
5531029 the only forces that are permitted to remain under the cease fire agreement are the forces that were in there at the aug 6 time frame
5531030 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5531031 i think the russians will pull out but will damage georgia strongly
5531032 georgia will survive but russia has lost its credibility in the eyes of the world
5531033 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5531034 if someone thinks that our citizens can be killed soldiers and officers who are peacekeepers killed with impunity we will never permit that
5531035 anyone who tries to do so will face a crushing response
5531036 these guys arent in prison because many times theyve already served their prison sentences been deported and have returned and remained in the shadows
5531037 certainly this is historic its different but its very consistent with the long partnership weve had with the united states navy
5531038 we understand that and we will strive to find the best and the brightest here in the coast guard to support that program
5531039 we will get a great skill set and experience set from what they will learn
5531040 we think this program will bring a lot of experience back to the deployable operations group and the coast guard as a whole
5531041 a military mission we have a counterterrorism mission we have an anti terrorism mission and we also have a mission to conduct high end specialized law enforcement in the caribbean the eastern pacific and around the homeland
5531042 the coast guardsmen will bring their knowledge base on maritime operations law enforcement operations port security and homeland security to the seal teams
5531043 it doesnt mean the seal teams are going to conduct law enforcement operations but understanding how law enforcement operations work and understanding the experiences a new person brings to the team will only make them better
5531044 what we want to do is make sure that all of our military members their family members and all of our u s citizens residing outside the united states have an opportunity to vote
5531045 absentee voting can be done by mail there are also some alternatives that weve been working with the states for electronic alternatives for our voters
5531046 so many states have passed legislation that allows a voter to submit voting materials by fax or e mail
5531047 we want to give the citizens as many opportunities as many alternatives as possible that are allowed by their state law to communicate with that local election office
5531048 we want everyone to participate in the voting process our servicemembers their family members and all of our overseas citizens
5531049 it is voting outreach to let them know that they are eligible to participate in this democratic process
5531050 so it is up to the voter to decide what they want to do
5531051 we want to make sure they have the information and the means to do so if they choose to vote
5531052 a pesar de que disponemos de toda la documentaci n
5531053 tambi n se investigar si puede haber alguna causa com n en ambos siniestros porque es aparentemente una casualidad pero resulta llamativa
5531054 there are several industries we have looked at that are having labour shortage crisis issues and these are all industries that timor can gain skills from
5531055 what we have proposed is 300 employees and trainees in the first pilot year and we are also requesting 100 occupational trainees
5531056 timor would certainly benefit from the fact that we have such a large youth unemployed and unskilled so called bubble
5531057 these people guest workers certainly would assist in timors national and human security recovery and development
5531058 the key problem here is that we have a government that turns around and says we need to bring in 2 500 guest workers as part of a pilot program but then refuses to detail any other information
5531059 is it too much to ask for a full costing is it too much for the government to actually put in place the parameters and the policy decisions that need to be made as to how this scheme will operate
5531060 there are many parts of the tourism industry that are looking for workers
5531061 yet for some inexplicable reason the labor party says the horticultural industry can have workers but the tourism industry cant
5531062 we need some clear and specific policy parameters before the opposition can determine whether or not we will support this
5531063 thirty years ago 20 years ago we were the fruit pickers
5531064 we were the cotton chippers we did all this rural work we were the unskilled labourers in the rural industry
5531065 we created a false economy and then people got used to the idea of staying at home rather than actually going out and looking for work
5531066 and they did travel they used to move down to mildura they used to go out to moree they used to go all these areas doing the fruit picking doing the cotton chipping
5531067 the extension of the quarantining of welfare payments needs to be extended into the dole payments as well
5531068 we have to get people back into that mindset that their uncles and their grandparents and their parents had about working
5531069 in view of certain developments a decision has been taken that fiji will not attend the forum meeting in niue
5531070 this regrettable and unfortunate situation of fiji not participating in the forum meeting in niue arises because of the decision taken by the government of new zealand
5531071 his attendance was expected and there is no reason he should not do so
5531072 commodore bainimarama had the opportunity through his attendance at the forum to explain this decision in person to pacific leaders
5531073 fiji will still be despite his absence a major feature of leaders discussions in niue
5531074 that commodore bainimarama should meet his solemn commitment to hold elections by march next year
5531075 he is trying it on here the bottom line is that there is no forum event in new zealand
5531076 trying to blame new zealand for something that doesnt exist is nonsense
5531077 some pacific countries have arranged to have bilateral meetings here that is entirely their business
5531078 the pacific forum needs to understand that we in fiji will decide what is in our national interest in the short and the long term
5531079 it is very well for the new zealand prime minister to call for unity of the pacific forum on the issue of elections in fiji
5531080 this so called unity cannot be against fiji as that is neither achievable nor acceptable
5531081 most if not all pacific island leaders are against fiji being further victimised by australia and new zealand even if they may not say so openly in niue
5531082 according to the independent electoral commission it will take at least another 12 to 15 months to prepare for election
5531083 that is why i have said that the most practical date for the general election under the new system cannot possibly be march 2009
5531084 so in this homeland i vow to live and die
5531085 the host nations request for assistance is a true testament of their commitment to remembering those americans who lost their lives here
5531086 they died tragically but were peacekeepers working to end a horrible war
5531087 the bosnians effort to remember them is such a great testimony of the difference these men made here
5531088 weve never had such a warm reception for our work
5531089 restoring the monument is very important to the people here because for the bosnians these four men helped bring an end to their war this monument is a symbol to bosnia of the peace and democracy they enjoy today
5531090 if theyd been like anyone else in the general public you would have expected it to go up 50 percent
5531091 the things that affect the general public are the things that affect our military as well
5531092 but they do have some stopgaps in place to help them more so than the average citizen
5531093 if people bought high in 2005 and have to move now they may be caught with negative equity in their house because the value has started to fall
5531094 we have resources available and encourage members to take advantage of the financial services and counseling available through their installation
5531095 we want to keep our men and women overseas especially the ones in harms way concentrating on the mission at hand and the important tasks they have to accomplish rather than their financial situation at home
5531096 theyre not going to be keeping their eye on the target if theyre worried about stuff back home
5531097 we look at the family and the servicemember as a team
5531098 so this is really a matter of allowing the servicemember to focus on his job and allowing the spouse and the family to focus on their job so together we can accomplish the mission
5531099 i hope i can avoid surgery but the way it is right now its pretty bad pretty sore and i cant play
5531100 if its surgery then im out eight weeks and im done for the season but until the doctor tells me im going to hope for the best
5531101 there are a lot of things i want to accomplish you prepare to play a full season and when its cut short thats disappointing
5531102 the interstate 15 express lanes are a freeway within a freeway
5531103 the movable barrier in the median can be adapted to suit the traffic demands of the corridor what we are doing with the makeover of interstate 15 is creating options for the commuters of san diego
5531104 they jumped on it really fast sometimes conditions just combine to make it difficult to catch
5531105 the unstable air hit and it blew up on em
5531106 acho que n o vai rolar da gente se conhecer
5531107 pero no tiene que ser m s exagerada de lo que debe ser porque ello provoca un estado de ansiedad que no permite jugar con normalidad

5531109 i will be supporting the removal of abortion from the crimes act i think thats the right thing its the right thing in terms of public policy
5531110 but i would stress that the proposal we are putting to the parliament is one that would be consistent and fully consistent with current clinical practice
5531111 for women i think its a crucial matter for them that a personal decision theyve made about themselves and their body is subject to action under the criminal code
5531112 removing this from the criminal code is important for women it is something that many women and many womens organisations have fought long and hard for so i think its important
5531113 today the rights of the unborn children have been forsaken by the victorian government this is a very very sad event
5531114 i dont want women any more to feel that this is some kind of terrible shame
5531115 interestingly this morning all the emails that i have been getting are from women in my age group who underwent similar sort of circumstances themselves and i think its really important to bring down that taboo
5531116 if it is that the bill reflects the second of the third options as reflected in the paper then i will oppose it
5531117 we heard some rumours and were hoping for something better but obviously this is a historical opportunity and hopefully this government will act in the right and compassionate way for women
5531118 the team was established at the request of both governments to help bring about a peaceful closure to this matter consistent with the principles of justice and respect for human rights and dignity
5531119 the men are going through what women went through when breast cancer wasnt talked about as much as it is today
5531120 i wanted to help put men at ease which i can do by talking about my experience with cancer
5531121 most men who call us are confused about what they want to do so we talk about what weve experienced and if the men want to get information about another method they can talk to someone else whos had that experience
5531122 people like to talk to us because we understand the rollercoaster of emotions when you first hear the diagnosis from your doctor some people talk to us before theyve told their families
5531123 and a lot of men are worried about their sex life when they hear they have prostate cancer
5531124 ive still got a rather lengthy amount of time before i decide anything
5531125 the pendulum is swinging very heavily in the direction of it just being over ive never sat around and not gotten ready to head to florida well not in 23 or so years anyway so to me that will likely be the last real test for me and whether or not i want to put the time and effort into getting after it one more time
5531126 next i started thinking about the original plan of pitching the 2nd half of next season thing is that urgency just is not there i miss some things i didnt think i would and dont miss many things
5531127 a nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master and deserves one

5531185 i am so disappointed that you have flipped on most of those courageous positions during this campaign and that you have hired the very people who smeared you so badly in south carolina eight years ago to run your campaign right now
5531186 after you and your wife stated publicly that you would run a clean campaign focused on the issues all you ads and statements lately have been attacks on your opponent filled with lies and innuendo during a three day period you called senator obama a traitor who would rather lose the iraq win that lose the election you accused him of blowing off the troops in germany because reporters couldnt come with him on the visit while every reporter on the trip said that was a lie and you accused him of being a hypocrite when he wrote a beautiful message at yad vashem in jerusalem what has happened to the man i admired so much over the years

5531212 we are currently reviewing planned activity for tomorrow with the aim of resuming some outpatient clinics
5531213 patients will be notified whether they are to come to their appointment or whether it has been postponed boivin said
5531214 this study will potentially demonstrate that it is the regimen of administration of birth control pills rather than their specific formulation that results in successful treatment of pmdd
5531215 if we can eliminate the hormone cycling we should eliminate the pmdd symptoms
5531216 theyre regulators of mood and emotion so if you can eliminate the metabolites that have been implicated in pmdd you may create a huge benefit for women with pmdd
5531217 we believe this trial will help us understand the underlying physiology which will allow for the development of a range of possible new treatments
5531218 id gain weight my face would be puffy i had horrible cramps and that would get me mentally down the symptoms changed as i matured and had children it gradually became more emotional now it also affects my mental acuity and i can still get down sometimes
5531219 the impairment and reduction in quality of life for women with pmdd during their premenstrual phase is equivalent to people with major depression anxiety disorder and even post traumatic stress disorder
5531220 if we can show that continuous low dose contraceptives are effective that opens up another option that may have a better risk benefit profile than ssris
5531221 many women in our previous studies felt better knowing they were contributing to furthering our knowledge about this disorder and informing subsequent treatment options
5531222 we can give them a gold standard diagnosis if they do have pmdd and if they have something else we can help them find treatment for it
5531223 i know what to do and where to go i have all the information and i know help is there theres such a peace of mind from that
5531224 the more we understand the better we can treat it and the better for everyone
5531225 there is so much lost productivity in women with pmdd just think how much more a woman could accomplish if she didnt have to lose so much of herself and her energy every month
5531226 now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war

5531329 miao is probably a name given to them by the chinese at least in writing
5531330 the most convincing explanation of the origin of the term miao is that it represented an effort on the part of the chinese to recreate the sound of the word pronounced mong or mu as the h is unaspirated used by members of the ethnic group to refer to themselves
5531331 of their pre history only one thing is certain that is that the miao were in china before the chinese for it is the latter themselves who indicate the presence of the miao in the land which they the chinese were gradually infiltrating and which was to become their own country

5531361 when im good to go ill be out there i dont think its going to get any worst any better
5531362 i could probably play with it but the risk was that the tip of bone thats fractured could break off if does break off then thats a lot more serious and id have to have surgery and miss the rest of the year ill be pretty cautious about when i come back and then make sure its almost back to full health
5531363 the bottom line from our perspective is that the player has a contract which our rules obligate him to respect
5531364 our rules dont recognize a player or his new team being able to buy the way out of an existing contract its not a scenario that our existing rules contemplate or allow
5531365 we should forget emotions and we should start a new life with a transfer agreement in place
5531366 but without such an agreement if somebody will break the moratorium then it will be everybody could take any player and it will not be good for hockey
5531367 the khl shouldnt need a moratorium to adhere to a policy of respecting legal and binding contractual commitments

5531378 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then

5531405 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square senator obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge

5531414 people will always hold on to their traditions that they find valuable
5531415 if people are god fearing they are more likely to resort to constructive social behavior
5531416 if we were to socially engineer a moral system we should cut out destructive ideas such as militant jihadism and maintain the socially constructive ideas
5531417 what constructive systems do you think we should keep that we couldnt have come up with without religion what constructive strategies are we getting from religious dogma that in your eyes we couldnt have figured out on our own
5531418 chimpanzees show behaviors that seem likely precursors to human morality as when a high ranking individual breaks up a fight to save a weaker companion but for the most part might is right
5531419 the sociobiological theory while helpful in understanding the basic mechanism of the evolutionary process tends to be dangerously reductionist when used as the sole explanation of human and chimpanzee behavior after all whilst our biological in nature and instincts can hardly be denied we are and have been for thousands of years caught up in a cultural evolution as well we do things which are sometimes quite unrelated to any hope for genetic survival

5531455 kalau itu dilakukan untuk itu pendidikan itu ok tapi yang saya sesalkan dilakukan secara tiba tiba seolah olah tidak dilakukan secara terencana
5531456 ini yang mungkin harus terus kita kritisi jangan sampai pemerintah terus terusan dibebani tanggung jawab penutupan defisit pembiayaan

5531518 the practice of chiromancy palmistry is regarded by many as a pseudoscience and no hard scientific evidence has been found to back up claims of veracity
5531519 i pretty much knew that this was going to be the case when i left here thursday night
5531520 it didnt feel good and that was different from my rehab starts
5531521 i could try and get through the rest of the year if we were in a pennant race
5531522 then yeah maybe your approach is different based on conversations ive had with the doctors and how ive pitched the last two times with it clearly im not doing us any good
5531523 physically its possible well have a game plan and well be ready and firing for gold
5531524 its shit or bust weve both been preparing for this for a year me and chris hoy
5531525 its like a hurdle race as team psychiatrist steve peters says
5531526 im just riding for the semi final at the moment ill look at the videos tomorrow formulate a plan im surprising myself how strong i still feel after four days racing but bourgains no muppet hes been up there every year
5531527 i just want to get stuck in and do it now the waiting has been the worst part i want to take it on
5531528 its been very emotional just watching the boys and not racing watching the heats of the keirin i was in tears and it had hardly started
5531529 just a medal wont do it has to be gold
5531530 global scale shared computer capable of hosting the entire internet as an application
5531531 i think this ruling says at its heart that somebody who is an employee and wants to use the fmla as a get out of work free card better beware
5531532 employers are trying to do whatever they can to get a handle on the extensive amount of intermittent leave that is being used
5531533 it was never my understanding that the fmla requires you to be dead or in bed to be on fmla leave
5531534 if taking care of yourself means that you continue to shop continue to mow your lawn to cook wash your windows drive your car none of those things seem to be relevant
5531535 i just think its preposterous the investigation and surveillance of someone doing normal activities while theyre out on fmla leave i think its preposterous
5531536 the goal of this is to chill employees from taking fmla
5531537 i dont think these people should have to be afraid that if they leave their house that if they run out to get a pizza that theyre going to be fired
5531538 it wasnt acceptable in my case because who cares what shes doing if shes not under fmla leave she hadnt done squat
5531539 they had someone sitting outside of her house waiting for her to go out and mow during the day
5531540 the fact that employers are out there doing that means that there are legal lawsuits to be brought on behalf of employees who are victims of this practice
5531541 we certainly have problems with surveillance because i dont think that thats what the purpose of the fmla was
5531542 its not for the employer to second guess that and thats exactly what theyre doing when theyre out there investigating them
5531543 employers feel like theyve absolutely lost control over their work force when folks say hey ive got a migraine ive got to head out theyre looking for strategies and surveillance is one of them
5531544 i cant tell you the number of calls ive fielded from employers who are concerned about this
5531545 were not just going to take your word for it you will be surveilled
5531546 its not something you want to do all the time
5531547 the defendants will surveil the plaintiffs and if someone claims that they have a serious disability its highly relevant if that person is playing golf
5531548 there is more than meets the eye and if youre an employer act once you have the facts but not before

5531554 if god exists why is there evil if god is all powerful why doesnt he stop bad things from happening

5531623 may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5531624 a completely unsubstantiated obama campaign claim that john mccain somehow cheated
5531625 level of objectivity has fallen so low that reporters are now giving voice to unsubstantiated partisan claims in order to undercut john mccain
5531626 we are concerned that your news division is following msnbcs lead in abandoning nonpartisan coverage of the presidential race
5531627 when you see the certified humane raised amp handled label it means that an egg dairy meat or poultry product has been produced with the welfare of the farm animal in mind food products that carry the label are certified to have come from facilities that meet precise objective standards for farm animal treatment quality standards a team of veterinarians and animal scientists developed the animal care standards to ensure that producers and processors keep animals in conditions that have met high standards of animal care allow animals to engage in their natural behaviors raising animals with sufficient space shelter and gentle handling to limit stress making sure they have ample fresh water and a healthy diet without added antibiotics or hormones
5531628 three out of four american consumers 75 will choose food products certified as protecting animal care over those that are not
5531629 we dont pound each others buttholes we just like to work out a lot and watch sports in between tearin up the pussy of course
5531630 my vest is always open and 40 year old bitches love that shit
5531631 its nothing to do with incentive payments its all to do with recouping costs that in some situations amount to many thousands of dollars
5531632 love is giving someone the power to hurt you greatly and hoping they dont

5531639 this is what i was looking for where is my moral compass how do i use it and where does it point to
5531640 its borked dude this has nothing to do with attachment size
5531641 the internet on this computer stops working because you are trying to look at a foreign website and this computer because its korean gets confused
5531642 what the fuck are you talking about netscape jesus man where the fuck have you been
5531643 never in the history of the ski area has such a depth of snow been experienced although we measure a 3m average base depth itself a record there are drifts of snow that add another metre or more to this
5531644 once we can get staff on to the field its all hands on deck to dig out facilities create carparks and establish trails
5531645 by the time we reopen we will have lost 1 1 2 weeks of operation and our problems dont stop there
5531646 the cost of reopening the field is going to be quite significant and the snow just keeps falling
5531647 to be honest i found it difficult in marlborough and nelson to find anything tacky the comment is not meant to be derogatory its an interesting museum and i understand how much of a showpiece it is
5531648 its brilliantly run and operated by people who gave very good information
5531649 artsy dreadlocked wanderers mooch between cafes and coffee carts ducking into the bridge st bars or poetry readings in bookshops
5531650 i went through the town and checked out a few vineyards nearby but we have to put ourselves in the mindset of people visiting perhaps in the next edition richmond would be worth more attention
5531651 i hope that seeing such an important event take place here means that pain services across the nhs are going to improve for the benefit of peoples health
5531652 unfortunately the story of specialist pain services in scotland is one of chronic failure
5531653 it mirrors all too often the experience of patients being fobbed off with even higher doses of pain killers and the promise of future help which never materialises
5531654 raises the issue of what dejong and the partnership intend to do once the council hears the project
5531655 its something that will benefit the city and the business park and its supported by all of the people that ive talked to

5531663 desde hace muchos a os antes de yo ser alcalde vienen hablando de establecer una incineradora de basura en el barrio cambalache al este de la ciudad que afectar a a miles de residentes en la zona urbana
5531664 tengo dos versiones de lo que dice el testigo y me toca a m decidir cu l es la verdadera
5531665 cacho y nino cog an animales y se los entregaban al personal de acs
5531666 cacho y nino llevaron los animales hasta la van blanca de acs s vi el movimiento de llevar los animales hasta la van
5531667 ning n animal se qued en barceloneta acs se los llev todos
5531668 porque no los tuve en la vista todo el tiempo todas esas horas
5531669 barceloneta no cuenta con un procedimiento para disponer de animales
5531670 hubo gente a favor y otros en contra que me gritaron
5531671 este caso ha tenido tanta publicidad y reportajes que los jurados iban a estar contaminados
5531672 no es conveniente entrar en comentarios sobre las versiones del testigo
5531673 su prop sito es hacer un resumen de los hechos
5531674 today one of the leading salafist figures in the north dai al islam al shahhal identifies the salafist movement as the true face of islam
5531675 our goal was to develop a profitable company that was socially and environmentally responsible
5531676 through the dedication of a talented team of people recellular has exceeded all expectations with igcs support and investment we will dramatically expand the company and set the standard for success in electronics sustainability and clean tech operations
5531677 we processed almost 5 000 phones in our first year of business
5531678 today we get an average of 24 000 phones enough to fill seven mail trucks every day five days a week with the support and resources of igc we see the potential to double the number of mail trucks delivering to recellular in the very near future
5531679 they have revolutionized the electronics sustainability industry by providing a convenient solution for consumers to recycle their used handsets while at the same time extracting enough value from these phones to build a successful business we have investigated many clean tech companies including many in the cell phone recycling arena and we felt that recellular was clearly the worlds most promising cell phone reuse and recycling firm
5531680 crowing about the fact that someone reads my blag because it makes me feel good
5531681 the dollars that were put forward as far as cost i would suggest that the decisions been made and come december of this year workers will be informed that withinin 12 months there will be shift of that zinc production here in pirie it will go to hobart
5531682 clearly port pirie as a smelter has been around a long time it clearly will need new investment at some stage
5531683 if you asked college presidents in america probably at least 90 percent of us would say that raising the drinking age has not been a positive thing on our campuses
5531684 lets look at in a sense education rather than prohibition
5531685 today one of the leading salafist figures in the north dai al islam al shahhal identifies the salafist movement as the true face of islam
5531686 if the storm continues along its current path it should pass to the east of us and with the storm going counter clockwise the west side is more protected
5531687 well continue to monitor the storm and talk to government agencies and the league if it continues on its current track and road conditions are safe well continue with tuesdays game as planned
5531688 well the worst case scenario is were swept into the gulf of mexico
5531689 do we want to go that far with worst cases how about we go medium case
5531690 and if we dont play well still be in town to play wednesday
5531691 theyll strap us down with seat belts in our rooms and hopefully the cable tv stays on
5531692 if we lose cable guys are going to be upset
5531693 weve tried to replace light bulbs we can probably encourage more recyclable materials with our vendors
5531694 a hero who also could not stand the pain in his heel
5531695 the best way to comfort and support liu xiang is to continue to watch and support the other olympic competitions
5531696 a modest miracle for the yellow skinned chinese people and the asian people
5531697 liu xiang persisted but he honestly had no way to go on because the injury was right at the point of impact on his foot
5531698 liu xiang our message to you is this we will forever be with you
5531699 since the earthquake the media have seemed to discover the value of the individual and the value of life in communicating with the public
5531700 the public also developed a shared consciousness and a sympathetic response that is different from a simple sense of nationalism
5531701 top chinese athletes do not use ice and do not tape sports nutrition is nowhere on certain levels china is on equal footing with the west and we see that in the gold medal battle but they are not going to reach their full potential until they master sports medicine
5531702 in the u s athletes can train on their own schedules but in china because you are part of the system you train very hard the benefit is that you make rapid progress but your athletic career is shorter in the west an athlete might keep competing into the 30s and 40s but not in china
5531703 liu xiang took us to heaven and now he has taken us to hell
5531704 failing to bargain realistically and remove unattainable items from the table
5531705 you cant have a plan that just says were holding secret meetings and our question is just what the hell does that mean
5531706 there is no clear and obvious movement forward in the negotiating process by august 25
5531707 has not up to this point been viewed as something the parties feel would facilitate an agreement
5531708 it is considered too sexy for us its not good for viewers in malaysia we dont want our people our teenagers influenced by their performance we want clean artists artists that are good role models
5531709 usain is going to lower that time significantly over the next year and during his career
5531710 i induct usain into the exclusive club of being world record holder and olympic champion all in one i was the last guy that did that in the 100m and to be honest i am happy to have him as a part of that exclusive club
5531711 you dont even understand how happy i am that it
5531712 i am the olympic champion of the world number one 9 69 no one can beat me
5531713 yeah youre the guy who took those pictures of the lawson twins
5531714 howd you get them out of their panties i mean those young girls seemed pretty smart
5531715 well they just played a smart girl on packed home remember it took two of them to play the same girl i guess you could say they had a whole brain between them
5531716 plus the roofies i slipped into their wine coolers didnt hurt
5531717 oh that was the beauty of it all they were only 16 i could have made a hundred thousand off the pictures of their underaged drinking but the pantiless pictures secured me an extra fifty grand
5531718 you exploited the beloved cute little girls of americas favorite t v show drugged them and abused their trust for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars
5531719 its one of them new digital cameras there aint no film for you to destroy
5531720 jika di wina anda membanggakan gereja stephansdome nah kami bangga dengan patung ini
5531721 im clear absolutely 100 percent clear and clean it did not spread they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer
5531722 was so mad and i i just remember i was i was just shaking and then also immediately i had to go into
5531723 im clear absolutely 100 percent clear and clean it did not spread they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer
5531724 was so mad and i i just remember i was i was just shaking and then also immediately i had to go into
5531725 the kids from mississippi creative arts magnet school made all of these
5531726 our teachers have used the trail in teaching the kids about the outdoors but it wasnt until dan came out and said we want to involve you that we could do a project like this
5531727 we thought about a peace garden behind the lorient kmart with the tiles attached to rocks we would bring in
5531728 but we were lost as we began to think about the magnitude of actually bringing in enough rocks and figuring out a way to attach all these tiles the kids made over 300 plates
5531729 as far as i know there are no other community gardens on
5531730 one of my goals is to reduce the kind of petty crime that occurs along that part of the trail to return a sense of community
5531731 the art and the garden are a breath of fresh air in an otherwise fairly industrial setting
5531732 if the process is important to you do what it takes to change it not dishonor it when you said you wouldnt
5531733 thats like saying the process is not good enough just because it didnt work in your favor
5531734 we could have chosen not to endorse anyone but we gave our word
5531735 i see the challenges and difficulties in the community but by working together the community will rise up
5531736 im trying to reach out so that any problems can be addressed directly using whats out there
5531737 i tell people you dont have to be 40 to 50 years old to be in the political process i want to show people that change can be achieved
5531738 i would work with the city to help rectify the problem we need to connect people to programs and resources and get them back into ownership
5531739 the more opportunities there are the less crime there will be solving the issues of economic development and public safety in district 58b work hand in hand and ultimately bring businesses into the area and increase pedestrian traffic among places of business
5531740 the northside is an untapped resource we have to get the word out no one should have to travel outside of the district to receive services but spend those dollars right here in the neighborhood
5531741 i commend businesses that choose to open on the northside and the gamble will pay off at the very least its attracting people back into the neighborhood
5531742 it goes far beyond police we have to get neighbors and residents involved
5531743 were always hearing about the negatives some people dont know how well our schools can do what about the north high school graduate who received a gates millennium scholarship and a full ride to concordia university
5531744 when people start believing in rumors they believe that they can only do so much eventually they begin to think bad news is normal
5531745 right now were working on a community benefits agreement in the bryn mawr and harrison neighborhoods with regards to the bassett creek valley development which is contracted through ryan companies
5531746 this way we can make sure certain benefits are in place like affordable housing maintaining the integrity of the neighborhood and even ensuring that minorities are helping with the building development process it needs to be a cyclical process so that everyone has the opportunity to be involved
5531747 have the resources and actually know where to go to help or seek help
5531748 the stability of a republican form of government depending mainly upon the intelligence of the people it is the duty of the legislature to establish a general and uniform system of public schools the legislature shall make such provisions by taxation or otherwise as will secure a thorough and efficient system of public schools throughout the state
5531749 it was very important to get dustin under contract for the next five years
5531750 he has played a major role in our football teams fortunes and certainly has performed at an outstanding level we have every reason to expect that his performances will continue to improve we fully see him as having pro bowl ability
5531751 itulah sebabnya mengapa dolar as mengalami penguatan terhadap seluruh mata uang dunia akhir akhir ini padahal belum lama kita mendengar isu tentang resesi ekonomi as hal ini menunjukkan spekulan spekulan itu melihat dolar as lebih menarik daripada komoditas meskipun ekonomi as sedang guncang
5531752 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5531753 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5531754 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5531755 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5531756 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5531757 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5531758 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5531759 we were given the option of stitches or no stitches it was definitely a significant wound but we were told that if the dog had anything we could stitch it up inside his body and that would be worse
5531760 if someones gonna take a spill its me and not you who told you your allowed to rain on my parade
5531761 billy brings a wealth of nfl experience to the rams in the areas of player personnel and scouting
5531762 he has proven to be an excellent evaluator of players throughout his career in the nfl and will work with coach linehan in making final decisions on all personnel matters
5531763 throughout my 11 years with the rams everybody in the organization has been fantastic from top to bottom
5531764 but my retirement is the best for me my family and the rams
5531765 jeff has been one of the best kickers that i have ever seen
5531766 we will miss him here but we also wish him well in retirement
5531767 well have to see how the landscape develops as we try and get these contracts signed
5531768 we havent talked candidly about where those tough decisions might be we know if this deal is not restructured it will entail us having to make some tough moves
5531769 the htc touchs intuitive software makes it much more than a phone it opens up a world of media communication and social interaction its really a multimedia experience at the tip of ones fingers
5531770 so this wordpress thing is too good to be true

5531773 nosotros hemos pensado desde hace tiempo en tener una l nea a rea fuerte con el fin de consolidar al mercado mexicano y competir internacionalmente pues no es posible que se tengan 14 aerol neas cuando las condiciones se han agravado a nivel mundial
5531774 tener tantas l neas a reas en un mercado del tama o del mexicano no tiene mucho sentido el a o pasado intentamos comprar aerom xico pero la cofeco no estuvo de acuerdo con el planteamiento y rechaz nuestra posibilidad de participar
5531775 tenemos entendido que en la comisi n de competencia no ha habido un cambio respecto a la valoraci n

5531779 m xico es el epicentro del problema en am rica latina en materia de impunidad seguridad y autocensura
5531780 la misi n internacional comprob que hay una creciente autocensura en los medios de comunicaci n mexicanos como consecuencia directa de las t cticas de terror que han implementado las mafias

5531782 que la gente se cuide y use su sexualidad responsablemente

5531790 en el camino de mi vida encontre un ave preciosa no quer a que escapara de mi por ello en una jaula la meti para que estubiera siempre conmigo al pasar los d as el ave murio la ahog su falta de libertad
5531791 me dedique a hacer cosas a la espalda de los demas pero esa espalda lo vio todo
5531792 quer a ser tan popular y ese d a en que estaba rodeado de tanta gente me di cuenta que nunca hab a estado tan solo
5531793 el problema de llegar a las profundidates de todo de cada palabra de cada momento de cada vida es que a veces es damasiado oscuro y no se puede regresar
5531794 cuando todo lo sabes deseas la ignorancia por que saberlo todo y no saber nada es lo mismo una laguna infinita de ser juzgado y juzgar
5531795 las dos cosas que mas duelen enla vida son encontrar lo que siempre hemos deseado y perderlo
5531796 no se cuanto tiempo ha pasado en realidad pudieron ser solo unos minutos peor para mi son horas de espera de que hacer tener el arma de el hombre que hay frente a mi apuntandome a la cabeza cuando yo hago lo mismo con mi arma la sociedad apesta dije yo con un tono fuerte a si eso crees pero la sociedad es un medio es un modo es un algo que nos lleva a la gloria cuando tu la manipulas asi es a ver la sociedad no es algo para dar la vida por ellos es algo para vivir mejor solo es eso un medio aprende a jugar en el y estaras bien sino te dejaras comer por ella manipulas o eres manipulado no pasaron unos minutos de silencio bueno eso creo dame una buena razon para no dispararte ahora mismo grite en tono desesperado mmmmm puede ser que no estas en posici n de elegir me dijo moviendo su arma en forma ret rica en mi frente la verdad no me importar a morir en este instante ya la sociedad me ha defraudado demasiado pero tu sabes muy bien que no quieres morir asi que dame una buena raz n y te dejare vivir si donde no exist a lo posibilidad de que nos estubieramos apuntando ambos con un arma si ese mismo pasado donde hiciste lo que hiciste no entendi muy bien sus palabras hasta ese momento en que escuche un estruendo y senti un ardor en mi estomago quise tirar del gatillo pero no me dieron las fuerzas lentamente deje caer el arma al suelo no se disparo y yo me desplome sent a como la vida me abandonaba lentamente pero antes ten a que ver quien fue el escritor de mi destino al abrir mis ojos por ltima vez descubri que era ella la que me hizo perder la fe en el mundo la que alguna vez estubo cerca y me mostro la verdad la que es la mano derecha de aquel con quien ten a la disputa hu lo mas rapido que pude para escapar de mi delito no pude olvidarlo en que me habia convertido quer a terminar con todo a lo mejor si acababa con mi creador todo ser a el fin todo al fin terminar a despues de todo l fue el comienzo de mi desgracia no me importaba si estaba vivo o no solo quer a venganza
5531797 llegue a aquel lugar donde se encontraba l antes habia intentado matarlo pero no habia logrado salir victorioso siempre l estaba un paso delante de mi a n no pod a entender por que pero ese d a lo comprendi me enfrente a l por primera vez pelie sin necesidad de sangre luche por esa venganza que anhelaba y no como una bestia asi no pod a ganar use la cabeza y de ese modo estube a su nivel al final un candelabro contruido en el techo del lugar cayo sobre l y lo dejo a mi merced por que yo por que no me mataste por que me convertiste en esto le pregunte mientras le apuntaba con una estaca al corazon l se encontraba inmovil no se resist a mucho hasta respondio con esto eres impulsivo audaz eras perfecto para esto tu nico problema era qure amabas mas que a cualquier cosa a esa mujer por mas que te ofreciera poder no lo hubieras aceptado por ella lo nico que te haria decidir es si la ve as morir yo sab a que venias cuando la hice m a todo estab planeado para que llegara este momento y me hicieras descanzar incluso para un vampiro no es facil acabar con si mismo es mas alla de esto morir al pelear es lo que se desea que alguien con un deseo mas ferviente que el tuyo te elimine es mas un honor me has causado mas sufrimiento del que cualquiera hubiera podido hacerme en vida y a travez de mi has causado mayores desastres que cualquiera que este d a sea tu fin diciendo esto clave la estaca en su corazon pero no fue con en los libros ni en las historias de cine no se hizo polvo y no se acabo todo simplemente lo hice descanzar
5531798 era la primera vez que despertaba desde que l me habia mordido no me importaba nada solo segui un olor a sangre que era mas una necesidad que un gusto seguir como una bestia me avalance sobre el cuerpo que me habian planteado y comence a beber sin parar el cuerpo quedo seco por completo este es ahora tu destino esto es lo que debes ser yo te escogi asi como alguien me escogio a mi y de ese modo alg n d a me podras librar de la pena que yo tengo en esta tierra buscam y librame del dolor y escoge a tu sucesor que te traera la libertad pasaron d as pasaron meses y mi vida era la de un depredador mataba por placer comia por diversi n y andaba entre humanos como solo una bestia buscando el placer de la sangre pero un d a todo cambio era ella era hermosa decidi que ten a que tenerla asi que la lleve conmigo la convenci en realidad no quer a venir pero la persuadi dicierndole que su padre quer a que viniera conmigo de ese modo la pude tener estaba en mis brazos su sangre fue demasiado sabrosa el sabor era inolvidable en ese momento entro un hombre en su mirada enocntre algo que lamento no haber encontrado antes
5531799 pensar tan bestial que habia ganado y quer a ser de nuevo mas
5531800 recuerdo aquella noche yo estaba enamorado no exist a nada mas para mi que vivir por ella me dirig a hacia su casa era cerca de las 8 00 de la noche en realidad era temprano pero no esperaba encontrarme con algo semejante
5531801 existimos por nuestros pensamientos ellos son los que nos hacen seres diferentes de los demas y due os de nuestro propio destino
5531802 ten a tus amigos cerca y a tus enemigos a n mas cerca
5531803 soy un sue o del destino en este mundo donde no pertenesco pero que ahora esta a punto de convertirse en mi hogar
5531804 a lo nico que hay que temerle es al miedo mismo
5531805 tienes dos opciones estar con la masa o crear la tuya yo opte por la segunda y cuando tengo suerte somos mas
5531806 all i really want is some patience a way to calm the angry voice and all i really want is deliverance want some peace and a place to find a common ground and all i really want is some confort a way to get my hands untied and all i really want is some justice
5531807 amidst the blue skyes a link from past to future the sheltering wings of the protector the flames of hatred scorch the skyes igniting gaia s funeral pyres
5531808 no se cuando no se por que no se como existe solo se que no me es psible borrarte ya eres parte de mi
5531809 una lucha insesante por conservar lo que es la vida con servar el tiempo y conservar un orden en las cosas darme cuenta de que no estoy solo y de que tengo mucho por que luchar
5531810 simplemente no estoy solo tengo a quienes proteger y no me rendire hasta que mi ltimo aliento de vida sea dado para proteger
5531811 solo soy un sue o del destino y asi suene egoista esta es mi historia y mientras sea asi debo luchar asi me cueste mi existencia el salvar la de quienes amo
5531812 la vida te da golpes duros pero te da recuerdos en los que viven para siempre aquellos que amas luego solo nos resta luchar por recuperar la felicidad y encontrarlo de nuevo a l
5531813 los demonios no lloran ese es un don que solo los humanos poseen por qu ellos pueden amar nosotros no
5531814 soy un alma herrante que busca su libertad no tengo due o pero si alguien esta dispuesto a acompa arme en mi viaje que lo haga solo le advierto que no sera facil
5531815 los demonios no amamos eso cre a pero solo somos una diferencia de nombre sentimos y podemos dar la vida por aquellos que nos importan aunque podemos ser crueles con quienes nos atacan
5531816 lucha por lo correcto al menos por aquello que crees
5531817 lo mas importante para mi es descubrir que lo que necesitamos en este mundo no son heroes solo necesitamos alguien con valor
5531818 lo mas precioso que nos queda en el vivir son los recuerdos por eso no podemos perderlos nos dan la vida

5531862 if they keep on saying that line if they cannot control their men then the government will certainly control them and we will undertake our mandate to protect the people and the communities and we cannot renege on that constitutional mandate
5531863 we have bent as far back backward and you know that even in north cotabato to give peace a chance the patience of our soldiers to really uphold the primacy of the peace process is very commendable but at some point we really have to act decisively
5531864 we cannot forever take that convenient excuse from the hierarchy or a group thats supposedly talking peace with government it is their responsibility if they are sincere and well meaning to reign in their forces to show some control over them that should not always be the case
5531865 so we will pursue and take aggressive action against the perpetrators of those dastardly acts committed against the innocent civilians you know what they did and of course we will file appropriate charges and other legal actions against the criminal group in coordination with the police
5531866 we will continue our operations it will not stop with the clearing of the areas that were occupied by them because they committed crimes and we have to pursue and that is part of our mandate

5531909 and his simple direct big questions brought out something we dont usually see in a presidential face off in this forum as opposed to a read the prompter speech or even a debate focused on the issues of the moment the candidates were forced to call on everything they had the things they have done and learned throughout their lives and the fact is john mccain has lived a much bigger life than barack obama thats not a slam at obama mccain has lived a much bigger life than most people but it still made obama look small in comparison mccain was the clear winner of the night
5531910 a source at the debate tells me that mccain had access to some communications devices in the few minutes before he went on stage with you and that there was a monitor in his green room in violation of the debate rules

5531917 commodore bainimarama at the pacific island leaders forum in tonga in october last year gave a faithful and unconditional undertaking to have an election in fiji before the end of march next year mr smith told sky news
5531918 he was compelled as a matter of honour to turn up to the forum and explain himself to the leaders
5531919 it is very disappointing that he wont turn up to effectively take his medicine
5531920 so its very disappointing and i think the leaders in niue including our own prime minister will understandably be very gravely disappointed at the refusal of commodore bainimarama to turn up
5531921 australia needs to argue strongly both regionally in the pacific and in the international community that fiji must return to democracy must return to respecting human rights and the rule of law and democratic processes in fiji

5532012 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5532013 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5532014 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5532015 if the mccain campaign wont return the money reed has raised for them then voters should rightly ask why it matters that reed didnt show up at tonights event the real question isnt why reed isnt showing up but why a so called reformer would invite him at all

5532026 what really impressed me with this property and the rme team was the amount of information that was available to me before i actually clicked on a property i had all my due diligence done for me right there on the website
5532027 we know what its like to follow a real estate agent around with our children in the back seat of the car making multiple offers and being refused multiple times we dont have the time to do that so its wonderful to leverage other peoples time and expertise
5532028 we always knew we should be doing something in real estate for the long term but didnt have a clue as to how to get started after being involved in nouveau riche and attending the training seminars we decided to take the plunge and buy that first property it was kind of scary to click on the button but we knew we had to start somewhere it went very well rme made the whole process go very smoothly
5532029 when you can take advantage of someone else going out and providing the deals the way they do its awesome

5532034 what really impressed me with this property and the rme team was the amount of information that was available to me before i actually clicked on a property i had all my due diligence done for me right there on the website
5532035 we know what its like to follow a real estate agent around with our children in the back seat of the car making multiple offers and being refused multiple times we dont have the time to do that so its wonderful to leverage other peoples time and expertise
5532036 we always knew we should be doing something in real estate for the long term but didnt have a clue as to how to get started after being involved in nouveau riche and attending the training seminars we decided to take the plunge and buy that first property it was kind of scary to click on the button but we knew we had to start somewhere it went very well rme made the whole process go very smoothly
5532037 when you can take advantage of someone else going out and providing the deals the way they do its awesome
5532038 its so easy anyone can do it were looking forward to doing it over and over again
5532039 the concierge found the property for me with just a click of a mouse there it is they also found the mortgage company they found my lease option tenant they did all the work and we were able to close in our own living room
5532040 and if no one is listening then it is because they dont want to hear because this is a referendum people dont need anyone to represent them they are representing themselves as somebody who has followed peoples movements and who has been in rallies and at the heart or the edge of things i dont think you can dispute what you see here
5532041 since the 1930s there have been debates and disputes about who has the right to represent the kashmiri people whether it was hari singh or sheikh abdullah or someone else and the debate continues till today whether it is the hurriyat or some other party
5532042 india needs azadi from kashmir as much as kashmir needs azadi from india
5532043 look son apologies to feminists here ill allow you to indulge in your delinquent behaviour in about two years from now when you are sixteen so why dont we make a deal and you have your freedom unquestioned and unfettered two years from now if you just exercise a little more self control now
5532044 placed its whole case for murder on a 16 year old who had consumed 80 ounces of malt liquor who had a view from a darkened park across a darkened roadway
5532045 is that it were going to hang him on that
5532046 isnt it a little late for you to be out
5532047 we made up a plan that we were going to tell the cops that nobody kicked him that there were no racial slurs there was no booze and brian got hit first
5532048 does exactly what mr ramirez was doing he throws a punch
5532049 its been a really hard day for me and im just really happy that the charges stuck

5532056 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5532057 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5532058 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5532059 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority
5532060 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies
5532061 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers

5532065 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies
5532066 if so many of the peppers we eat in the u s come in from mexico youd think we would want to pay more attention
5532067 were not worried about it weve seen this movie before
5532068 we dont want people to focus on the exact track this is a broad really diffuse storm all the florida keys and all the florida peninsula are going to feel the effects of this storm no matter where the center makes landfall
5532069 we want every every floridian and guest to be a survivor
5532070 i know its only a tropical storm but we take it seriously
5532071 everybody seems to be acting like this is a non event
5532072 it may be curtains soon for the management and shareholders of beleaguered housing giants fannie mae and freddie mac
5532073 such a move would almost certainly wipe out existing holders of the agenies common stock
5532074 well i walk there down to east selah road and over to the other place i walk to my sons house there its a mile and i walk back its a mile
5532075 its an ongoing problem at different times you probably notice from the freeway youve been getting the diesel smell here combined with all that its a build up
5532076 maybe if youre determined enough to leave your scratch in time itll happen
5532077 it was a false alarm so thats the problem with these devices there are more false alarms than there are real alarms
5532078 i pretty much knew that this was going to be the case when i left here thursday night
5532079 it didnt feel good and that was different from my rehab starts
5532080 i could try and get through the rest of the year if we were in a pennant race
5532081 then yeah maybe your approach is different based on conversations ive had with the doctors and how ive pitched the last two times with it clearly im not doing us any good

5532084 he was a batsman in top form but thats the way it goes in cricket you cant really stop and think about the guys you will be missing in the series rather than that you will have to fill in that space because that is the only way your team can win
5532085 we may look at a different combination of openers for the next game but its at a very initial stage we have just gone through the first game so whatever fits the team best well decide on that
5532086 it took us a bit long to figure out the two guys out
5532087 no not too tough to pick but he had good control it became easier as it went on and you figured out the shots you could use to score

5532106 saya sekarang masih menjadi bagian di tottenham hotspur tapi tidak ada seorang pun yang berhak untuk menggagalkan saya dalam mengejar mimpi
5532107 kami memiliki dua pekan sampai ditutupnya bursa transfer itulah momen terpenting saya membaca pernyataan sir alex ferguson bahwa dirinya menginginkan seorang striker dan saya harap itu berbatov
5532108 kami transfer arshavin ke spurs masih punya waktu kita lihat saja
5532109 in case you wonder about the strange numbering of the test
5532110 wow thank you the different up dos shown on my face are really helping me out
5532111 but suppressing the mayhem would be only the first step toward addressing the problem
5532112 the second would be for connecticut to realize that nearly everything it has done for half a century in the name of alleviating poverty has been worse than mistaken that it has massively created poverty that it has created a city where more than two thirds of the children grow up without fathers where only a third of high school students graduate and where indeed more high school girls have children outside marriage than graduate
5532113 the young man murdered after the parade in hartford leaves a 4 year old son
5532114 if connecticut wont urgently rethink its urban catastrophe the boy might as well be sent to prison now for his chances there might be better than in the city itself
5532115 children belong to all of us and we as men have an obligation to serve in a parenting role
5532116 this is something we talked about forever hes alex macks backup
5532117 we wanted to make sure we felt good about him at center then try him at guard thats kind of been the evolution of it he started playing a little bit of guard here a little bit of guard there until it finally got to the point where he was the best guard
5532118 alex is a great mentor my first few years here i just tried to learn from him he does everything right hes an all american and hopefully is going to have a great career in the nfl ive just tried to learn from him and try to get myself better
5532119 hes competed at guard and taken a major step forward
5532120 hes always had a great attitude worked really hard im really happy to see it
5532121 we have a lot of guys hurt right now at that position so its a good time to see what he can do
5532122 venham a mim todos v s que estam cansados e oprimidos e eu vos aliviarei
5532123 all caps one end the one with your username infront of it instead of local service network service or system
5532124 hopefully the next two days after tonight well get two ballgames in one way or another
5532125 the tampa st petesburg area is obviously a priority and this domed stadium is an evacuation center
5532126 were going to do whatever the league tells us to do whatever the city and state officials tell us to do
5532127 the worst case scenario is were swept into the gulf of mexico
5532128 you want a medium case scenario hopefully were going to get three games in
5532129 theyre going to strap us down in seat belts in our hotel room and hopefully the cable stays on
5532130 i knew joe would eventually build an organization to do this its happened quicker than what you might expect
5532131 many without event tickets flock to beijing to bask in national pride
5532132 even the cynical succumb to a moment of real national pride
5532133 it is something that only the people in cities around beijing care about
5532134 people from hunan an interior province and other far away places dont really feel very excited about it and i dont feel a personal connection to it
5532135 the olympics can only affect a very small part china the rest will be left behind
5532136 we thought it might be good but it doesnt help us
5532137 eventually this could explode somewhere into a much larger more violent movement
5532138 surveys have long shown that religious believers in the united states are happier healthier longer lived and more generous to charity and to each other than are secular people
5532139 like most people i was filled with fears about chemotherapy particularly about the possible side effects it wasnt fun no one will tell you that chemotherapy is fun but it wasnt as bad as i expected either
5532140 the point is not that we atheists can prove religion to be the cause of more harm than good though i think this can be argued and the balance seems to me to be swinging further toward harm each day the point is that religion remains the only mode of discourse that encourages grown men and women to pretend to know things they manifestly do not and cannot know if ever there were an attitude at odds with science this is it and the faithful are encouraged to keep shouldering this unwieldy burden of falsehood and self deception by everyone they meet by their coreligionists of course and by people of differing faith and now with startling frequency by scientists who claim to have no faith even if haidts reading of the literature on morality were correct and all this manufactured bewilderment proves to be useful in getting certain people to donate time money and blood to their neighbors so what is science now in the business of nurturing useful delusions surely we can grow in altruism and refine our ethical intuitions and even explore the furthest reaches of human happiness without lying to ourselves about the nature of the universe it is time that atheist scientists above all people on this infatuated planet acted as if this were so
5532141 we are delighted that the british public has voted enid blyton its best loved author her storytelling is timeless
5532142 what makes blyton so successful is her imaginative exciting and magical style her writing has sent countless young readers on thrilling adventures and we hope that new generations will continue to enjoy her enchanting stories
5532143 imagine if you could download a song from amazon com and send it to the mobile phone of a friend or the car stereo of someone who has satellite radio
5532144 it is estimated that while this will take a financial commitment of 200 million each year for the next four years on top of the current provisions for road safety funding it will also save the state in the region of 600 million in costs associated with road crash deaths and injuries
5532145 faced with the embarrassing prospect of holding a fund raiser with one of jack abramoffs closest associates the mccain campaign scrambled today to scratch ralph reed from tonights program
5532146 the real question isnt why reed isnt showing up but why a so called reformer would invite him at all
5532147 the irony that barack obama and his allies would attack john mccain for rooting out corruption in washington and fighting special interests like jack abramoff with these baseless assertions speaks to the real level of commitment that barack obama has for making any change in washington
5532148 reed is a bad version of us no more money for him
5532149 the irony that barack obama and his allies would attack john mccain for rooting out corruption
5532150 trai deserves credit for a wonderful job we welcome any step towards liberalization and deregulation and are happy to embrace this recommendation s behura secretary dot told toi
5532151 well take over the cement plants at midnight because the deadline has come and theyll become state property
5532152 it was not possible to arrive at an agreement with them cemex and the next step that we must take is to proceed with expropriation
5532153 asking a price way above the real price they were asking for more than 1 2 billion dollars
5532154 so tomorrow well go ahead with nationalizing and regaining the cement industries
5532155 while im in power with your help and gods venezuela will march down the road of equality social justice and socialism
5532156 i am aware of my many limitations in the depth and breadth of my own understanding of both subjects and so i ask your indulgence even if the definitive statements on these subjects were possible what follows is not such my objective is much more modest i hope only to trace my own thinking and understanding of the subject in the hopes that it will stimulate others to go further and perhaps through my errors i hope not to have made many but it was inevitable that i would new insights wil emerge
5532157 there are a vast number of stars within our galaxy the number is not so large as the number of cometary nuclei around the sun but it is nevertheless hardly modest its about 400 billion stars of which the sun is one
5532158 even ordinary stars like the sun have a sequence of events late in their history which mean big trouble for in habitants of any planets that they might have some 5 or 6 or 7 billion years from now the sun will become a red giant star and will engulf the orbits of mercury and venus and probably the earth
5532159 this has theological implications as there is a great deal of suffering and death that is apparent in the cosmos if there is a great deal of life
5532160 we have a theology that is earth centered and involves a tiny piece of space and when we step back when we attain a broader cosmic perspective some of it seems very small in scale and in fact a general problem with much of western theology in my view is that the god portrayed is too small it is a god of a tiny world and not o god of a galaxy much less a universe i dont propose that it is a virtue to revel in our limitations but its important to understand how much we do not know there is an enormous amount we do no know there is a tiny amount that we do but what we do understand brings us face to face with an awesome cosmos that is simply different from the cosmos of our pious ancestors
5532161 i believe it is true that humility is the only just response in a confrontation with the universe but not a humility that prevents us from seeking the nature of the universe we are admiring if we seek that nature then love can be informed by truth instead of being based on ignorance or self deception if a creator god exists would he or she or it or whatever the appropriate pronoun is prefer a kind of sodden blockhead who worships while understanding nothing or would he prefer his votaries to admire the real universe in all its intricacy i would suggest that science is at least in part informed worship
5532162 carl sagan was an unrivalled master at communicating the breadth and beauty of science it is not an accident that he was one of the twentieth centurys most incicive critics of popular delusion ann druyan has unearthed a treasure it is a treasure of reason compassion and scientific awe it should be the next book you read
5532163 the newtownian gravitational superstructure replaced angels with gmm r2 which is a little more abstract and in the course of that transformation the gods and angels were relegated to more remote times and more distant causality skeins the history of science in the last five centuries has done that repeatedly a lot of walking away from divine microintervention in earthly affairs it used to be that the flowering of every plant was due to direct intervention by the deity now we understsand something about plant hormones and phototropism and virtually no one imagines that god directly commands the individual flowers to bloom so as science advances there seems to be less and less for god to do its a big universe of course so he she or it could be profitably employed in many places but what has clearly ben happening is that evolving before our eyes has been a god of the gaps that is whatever it is we cannot explain lately is attributed to god and then after a while we explain it and so thats no longer gods realm the theologians give that one up and it walks over onto the science side of the duty roster weve seen this happen repeatedly and so what has happened is that god is moving if there is a real god of the western sort i am of course speaking only metaphorically god has been evolving toward what the french call un roi faineant a do nothing king who gets the universe going establishes the laws of nature and then retires or goes somewhere else
5532164 well looks like when you take away freedom life doesnt sprout up it dies
5532165 its no accident that the idea of the absence of god because of its intrinsic falsehood has led to the greatest forms of cruelty and violations of justice
5532166 the claim that humanity can and must do what no god actually does or is able to do is both presumptuous and intrinsically false
5532167 a world which has to create its own justice is a world without hope
5532168 the claim that humanity can and must do what no god actually does or is able to do is both presumptuous and intrinsically false
5532169 it is no accident that this idea has led to the greatest forms of cruelty and violations of justice rather it is grounded in the intrinsic falsity of the claim a world which has to create its own justice is a world without hope
5532170 opens up appalling possibilities for evil possibilities that did not formerly exist we have all witnessed the way in which progress in the wrong hands can become and has indeed become a terrifying progress in evil
5532171 we must do all we can to overcome suffering but to banish it from the world is not in our power
5532172 simply because they do not find the prospect of eternal life attractive

5532176 baley met some older girl scouts earlier this year and heard about some of their past projects
5532177 she asked me what she could do to help us at the department and we found out the dogs needed some cooling vests
5532178 they really got into the recycling and i am tired of seeing the cans
5532179 when she found out that she raised enough money for the equipment she had a huge smile on her face she has been like a beam of light walking around i am very proud of her
5532180 she wants to now raise money and recycle more cans to purchase a k 9 officer for a local law enforcement agency in need
5532181 she thinks she can do just about anything now and i think it is great she really wants to help and those dogs are a great tool to help fight crime

5532218 when asked what about her options after she retires from pool swimming
5532219 the next shock is going to be bigger and bigger still
5532220 the shocks keep getting bigger because we keep propping things up and bailing everyone out

5532301 during my time in georgia i surveyed the human and geopolitical consequences of the conflict there firsthand
5532302 i left the country convinced that russias invasion of georgia may be the one of the most significant event to occur in europe since the end of communism
5532303 russia must make good on president medvedevs commitment to immediately withdraw russian troops to their positions before the current fighting began
5532304 when congress reconvenes i intend to work with the administration to seek congressional approval for 1 billion in emergency assistance for georgia with a substantial down payment on that aid to be included in the congress next supplemental spending bill
5532305 i have long sought to help russia realize its extraordinary potential as a force for progress in the international community and have supported legislative efforts intended to forge a more constructive relationship with the kremlin but russias actions in georgia will have consequences

5532334 i know there are a lot of fast linebackers out there and i know a few years ago denver probably held that title with al wilson and d j williams and ian gold but we have it now our speed takes teams by surprise our line does a great job and then we can fly around i really truly believe with those guys on my side they make me better then i can showcase my abilities more because teams are focused on the other backers any game someone can step up and have 13 tackles a sack and a pick

5532369 a great deal still depends on the decisions and good judgment of the next president the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5532370 we won a massive victory in a few weeks and we did so with very limited loss of american and allied lives we were able to end aggression with minimum overall loss of life and we were even able to greatly reduce the civilian casualties of afghani and iraqi citizens
5532371 well then why was there a banner that said mission accomplished on the aircraft carrier look i have said a long time that reconstruction of iraq would be a long long difficult process but the conflict the major conflict is over the regime change has been accomplished and its very appropriate
5532372 senator obama commits the greater error of insisting that even in hindsight he would oppose the surge even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory

5532400 i was convinced there was no real reason why the trucks could not be parked at the house at night but i found out the trucks were refrigerated and would run on three phase power with the compressor running all night
5532401 that convinced me there would be excessive noise during the night because the compressor would have no other noises to compete against and might be heard in the distance
5532402 if the matter is put before me providing evidence which suggests the noise wont be intrusive then i might take a different opinion
5532403 the refrigeration units plug into three phase power points overnight so it would be very very quiet and i wouldnt even be able to hear it from my house which is about 80 metres away from where the trucks would be parked
5532404 the councillors have no idea what noise it would or would not make and if they took the time to investigate instead of just judge they would realise how little the trucks interfere with neighbouring properties

5532455 karena itu ingatlah kamu kepada ku niscaya aku ingat pula kepadamu dan bersyukurlah kepada ku dan janganlah kamu mengingkari nikmat ku
5532456 mengapa allah akan menyiksamu jika kamu bersyukur dan beriman dan allah adalah maha mensyukuri lagi maha mengetahui
5532457 jika kamu kafir maka sesungguhnya allah tidak memerlukan iman mu dan dia tidak meridhai kekafiran bagi hamba nya dan jika kamu bersyukur niscaya dia meridhai bagimu kesyu kuranmu itu
5532458 ya allah tak satu pun kenikmatan yang menyertaiku di pagi sore ini atau yang tercurah kepada salah satu dari makhluk mu maka itu adalah semata dari mu tiada sekutu bagi mu untuk mu lah segala puji dan untuk mu pula segenap syukur
5532459 dan terhadap nikmat rabbmu maka hendaklah kamu menyebut nyebutnya dengan bersyukur
5532460 barang siapa yang tidak mengetahui nikmat allah selain makan dan minumnya maka berarti pengetahuannya picik dan azabnya telah menimpa
5532461 tidak ada satu nikmat pun dari allah untuk hamba nya yang lebih utama daripada diajarkannya kalimat la ilaha illallah
5532462 adapun nikmat yang lahir nampak adalah islam sedangkan yang batin adalah tutup dari allah atas kemaksiatan kalian
5532463 aku memuji nya atas sesuatu yang andaikan aku diberi seluruh yang diberikan kepada manusia maka aku tidak mau menukarnya
5532464 apakah engkau tidak memperhatikan penglihatanmu lisanmu kedua tangan dan kakimu kesehatannya
5532465 demi allah aku tidak tahu mana di antara dua nikmat yang lebih utama atasku dan kalian apakah nikmat ketika masuk menelan ataukah ketika keluar dari kita membuang
5532466 tidaklah seorang hamba yang meminum air bening lalu masuk perut dengan lancar tanpa ada gangguan dan keluar lagi dengan lancar kecuali wajib baginya bersyukur
5532467 dan dia telah memberikan kepadamu keperluanmu dari segala apa yang kamu mohonkan kepada nya dan jika kamu menghitung nikmat allah tidaklah kamu dapat menghinggakannya sesungguhnya manusia itu sangat zalim dan sangat mengingkari nikmat allah
5532468 sungguhnya keadaan seorang mukmin itu sangat menakjubkan karena semua keadaannya menjadi kebaikan bagi dirinya jika mendapat nikmat ia bersyukur maka itu mejadi kebaikan baginya dan jika ditimpa musibah ia bersabar maka itu menjadi kebaikan baginya
5532469 dan dia telah memberikan kepadamu keperluanmu dari segala apa yang kamu mohonkan kepadanya dan jika kamu menghitung nikmat allah tidaklah kamu dapat menghinggakan nya
5532470 sesungguhnya manusia itu sangat zalim dan sangat mengingkari nikmat allah
5532471 allah sangat tidak adil aku sudah melakukan shalat lima waktu bahkan shalat malam pun sering aku lakukan dan aku sudah berdoa namun hingga detik ini dia tidak penah mengabulkan do aku sementara temanku yang tidak taat kepada allah dan selalu melakukan kemaksiatan malah diberi rizki yang berlimpah ruah sungguh allah sangat tidak adil
5532472 adapun manusia apabila tuhannya mengujinya lalu dimuliakan nya dan diberi nya kesenangan maka dia berkata
5532473 dia lah yang mencipta kan kamu dan menjadikan bagi kamu pendengaran penglihatan dan hati akal

5532503 the soaring prices of oil on the global level during these last six years have reminded us of the importance of safeguarding energy security in our homeland
5532504 were raising the energy supply capacity through accelerated energy diversification the utilisation of non fuel oil alternative energy including new and renewable energy such as micro hydro geothermal and biofuel
5532505 in addition to tapping renewable energies we must effectively save energy thus far we have been a nation that splurges on the use of energy
5532506 the whole of society is expected to save whether in private offices or in households
5532507 this is a very significant amount as we can make use of it for the development of our

5532516 the single best predictor of their skills is how much they had played video games in the past and how much they played now those were better predictors of surgical skills than years of training and number of surgeries performed

5532557 i think the russians will pull out but will damage georgia strongly
5532558 georgia will survive but russia has lost its credibility in the eyes of the world
5532559 we have no confidence in these international observers in these people who corrupt the truth
5532560 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5532561 it was pointed out to the u s that u s officials public statements on the events in south ossetia need to be brought into compliance with the reality of the difficult situation in the region
5532562 russia was dragged into the military crisis as a result of the adventure by saakashvili who would not dare to start it without outside support
5532563 the same applies to the entire region there is such ethnic overlapping in literally all countries and all this talk of this is our land we are liberating our land must be dropped
5532564 one should not try to resolve the problems of the caucasus by force such attempts have been numerous and every time the result has been the same a legally binding agreement on the non use of force is needed if the west helped to reach such an agreement it would do a good job if it takes a different road of condemning russia and rearming georgia and u s officials are already speaking of that a new aggravation is inevitable and the outcome will be even worse

5532604 with increasing numbers of households dispensing with their landlines 13 according to ofcom accessing the internet through the mobile phone network is a viable option especially for the young and mobile
5532605 customers find mobile broadband easy to use and install but transmission speeds and to a lesser extent network coverage reduce the initial enjoyment of getting up and running

5532629 how to grow more vegetables than you ever thought possible
5532630 we need to look into it before we step into it
5532631 you might be able to solve a metal mystery that has vexed me for 16 years
5532632 nobodys come up with a way to prevent this from happening even here in the u s
5532633 the u s is probably more internet dependent than any place in the world so to that extent were more vulnerable than any place in the world to this kind of attack
5532634 so much of what were doing in the united states is out there on the internet and all of that can be taken down at once
5532635 this is such a crucial issue at every level our security now is dependent on computers
5532636 its a whole new era political and military conflicts now will almost always have a cyber component the chief targets will be critical infrastructure and the attacks will emerge from within our own computer systems
5532637 it only takes a couple of experts it doesnt take a whole cyber infantry division to pull something like this off
5532638 for a very small investment in resources you can have a huge impact
5532639 when it comes to our government it security were pretty strong in protecting against attacks
5532640 we can command so much bandwidth that its hard to overwhelm our servers
5532641 we are vulnerable to more sophisticated attacks but right now most of the people who want to do us harm dont have those capabilities
5532642 youd see some disruption of essential services like electricity youd definitely see espionage
5532643 would it be decisive no nobodys going to win a conflict with the united states in cyberspace but would it be disruptive and irritating yes
5532644 we dont know quite what the rules are for this kind of conflict if its spying its illegal but is it an act of war and who do you arrest
5532645 were much safer in the u s than we were a year ago but we still have a long way to go
5532646 it is the second biggest economy in the world and in 50 years it will be the biggest
5532647 starting with diefenbaker trudeau and all of us we established very good relations relatively speaking with china
5532648 and suddenly you break the bridge it would have been easy just to be there
5532649 he had to swallow himself whole and he went there the chinese are like that ok fine you dont like us were not buying french food
5532650 as a canadian i deplore the fact weve lost our position in the world
5532651 ask any businessman who goes to china and theyll tell you that
5532652 im afraid i cant speak to the specifics of that letter and will not today
5532653 we remain suspended for the moment in afghanistan out of respect for the victims of this horrible crime
5532654 the change is that we suspended operations and we are looking at all of our processes
5532655 were looking at if and how we can continue working there to safeguard our international and national staff
5532656 we are surely committed to the afghan people as were jacqui nicole shirley and mohammad the four individuals that were killed
5532657 the young canadian women that were killed they were there to assist afghan kids go to school there are more young afghan kids in school including girls than ever before as result of this kind of humanitarian assistance
5532658 over the years weve worked there weve had various levels of insecurity to deal with and weve adjusted our operations accordingly
5532659 the area in which we work has been one of the safer areas although we have seen an increase in insecurity
5532660 in most environments where we work there are markings on our vehicles in afghanistan we dont use them anymore for obvious reasons
5532661 but what we do in situations like that or even as a result of what happened more recently we reassess our operations and security
5532662 but we are committed to stay on the ground and continue the work that we are doing but to ensure that we do it in as safe as possible means
5532663 were not going to respond to threats and certainly it will have no effect on canadian policy
5532664 already there are advocates saying that injection sites are not enough that government should hand out heroin for free
5532665 others are now calling for inhalation rooms for people who smoke their drugs while i support various aspects of harm reduction i believe that we have to draw the line somewhere with regard to these kinds of measures
5532666 i find the ethical considerations of supervised injections to be profoundly disturbing
5532667 we specifically take issue with the minister using that phrase
5532668 the minister was off base in calling into question the ethics of physicians involved in harm reduction
5532669 its clear that this was being used as a political issue
5532670 i found the use of medical ethics to justify a political decision which will affect social policy to be troubling at best and misleading at worst
5532671 ethics consist of a balancing of rights and harms as do all medical decisions that physicians in this room help their patients reach every day iv drug users as the rest of us have the right to compassion and to access and care which has proven to be beneficial
5532672 were not worried about it weve seen this movie before
5532673 there are bad storms and there are nice ones and this is a nice one
5532674 it cleans out all the trees it gives people a little work to do and it gets the tourists out of here for a few days
5532675 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5532676 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5532677 ive got a generator and ive got a concrete home that i built myself so i know it can withstand this
5532678 we realize that all fishers may not agree but it is essential that we have a fishery that is under control
5532679 an all herring diet affects the colour of the meat and lowers the price thats one of the major reasons we are not extending the quota now
5532680 so many people walk around with a meaningless life they seem half asleep even when theyre busy doing things they think are important this is because theyre chasing the wrong things the way you get meaning into your life is to devote yourself to loving others devote yourself to your community around you and devote yourself to creating something that gives you purpose and meaning
5532681 political order the queen placed back into command over sovereign georgia
5532682 note from merkel to rice you and your white house say good bye to georgia and lika and iran and u s and russia and all else would be fine
5532683 dead or alive this hacker now or you will die
5532684 the world has seen that even today there are political morons who are ready to kill innocent and defenseless people in order to satisfy their self serving interests while compensating for their own inability to resolve complicated issues by using the most terrible solution by exterminating an entire people
5532685 i think that there should be no mercy for that we will do our best not to let this crime go unpunished
5532686 you just dont move more than 1 200 tanks and 15 000 soldiers into a country within 12 hours without previous planning
5532687 russians have committed to withdrawing and they need to withdraw and so that is what we are looking for
5532688 we were all set and then the georgians came up with a bunch of new requirements with no time for us to act so the time to exchange prisoners was interrupted
5532689 russian forces continue to consolidate their enclaves in south ossetia and abkhazia
5532690 mounting evidence that russian and georgian military used armed force unlawfully during the south ossetian conflict
5532691 highlights the need for international fact finding missions in georgia
5532692 im not happy right now i was never good at languages
5532693 it definitely wasnt as bad as i thought it would be
5532694 ive been performing since i was three i have training in every aspect so for me to be compared with someone who sounds like they just began singing thats not really fair
5532695 i didnt come here to learn i just think i know more its that simple
5532696 shayna doesnt see the big picture she doesnt invest in the exercises or try to make new friends it just doesnt seem that she is here for the right reasons

5532700 he knew that he had something that she would never have her husbands complete devotion
5532701 you know what i think i think it was the cia that took him mansour wasnt the opposition he was my friend
5532702 no lets speak honestly we know he was a leader in the opposition but there is nothing wrong with that opposition means they disagree with your thoughts it means being against certain ideas not against you there is nothing wrong with that he always said you were his friend but he disagrees with you remember mansour didnt like to fight with anyone
5532703 the fbi started contacting me and asking me to meet them at this airport hangar in santa monica so i went a few times and basically they were saying to me if you go spy on hamas well let your father go so they were holding him like a pawn

5532705 the next day i started to call the consulate the embassy i called the state department in america i called this woman that my children had given me the phone number of who was with the world bank and basically everyone told me the same thing you no longer have any rights to your children you are under islamic law there are no reciprocal agreements there is absolutely nothing you can do
5532706 people in the middle east are either born as an oppressor or they were born to be oppressed the only way to make change was to embarrass her country and its laws the only way to change our laws is through retention from outsiders now that they know outsiders are watching jordan wants to appear progressive thats why i wanted to meet you deborah so that you can be our messenger
5532707 one of the great thrills of being there was meeting these incredible palestinians and israelis who wanted to work together for peace and i dont mean a few i mean a lot and there is just a huge grassroots civil movement going on and unfortunately it is not shown on the news the news would rather show the war that is going on but i tell you that these peacemakers are out there and they are strong and the people have a big desire to work together

5532732 it is our religious custom not to touch our women so we cannot search females our female iraqi police will be extremely important to use at checkpoints and government buildings throughout the province
5532733 they will bring fresh ideas to how we conduct business
5532734 but im proud to be a part of this page in kirkuks if not iraqs history
5532735 man or woman if you come through our checkpoint we will stop you
5532736 i will be able to take care of my son and also help ensure he has a safe future here
5532737 we are so used to hands on training when showing our recruits how to do something
5532738 in our custom we cannot touch our females that is the only difficult change for me that i see so far it is good that we have female coalition soldiers to help us
5532739 this is going to be an amazing experience for all of us
5532740 im looking forward to helping my fellow female police officer and being a part of the positive historic changes occurring here
5532741 but we need to keep the focus on the culprit here and the culprit here was that russia overreached used disproportionate force against a small neighbor and is now paying the price for that because russias reputation as a potential partner in international institutions diplomatic political security economic is frankly in tatters
5532742 it is russia that miscalculated it is russia that misjudged and russia is now seeing that the european union and the united states will not tolerate the kind of behavior that they engaged in as the soviet union before the end of the cold war the cold war is over
5532743 predict whether the 2008 congress will break the record number of jewish legislators that was established in the 2006 election cycle

5532745 the us government is strongly opposed to restrictive trade practices or boycotts targeted at israel
5532746 the commerce department is closely monitoring efforts that appear to be made to reinvigorate the arab boycott of israel and will use all of its resources to vigorously enforce us anti boycott regulations
5532747 yes of course the boycott is still in place and is still enforced
5532748 if a product contained even some components that were made in israel and you wanted to import it to dubai it would be a problem
5532749 is used by customs to confirm the country of origin and needs to be seen by the office which ensures any trade boycotts are enforced

5532751 they have their boys in there its time to start putting ours in
5532752 cant go to war with iran without getting approval from congress
5532753 and then the astounding thing is when asked why she said the leadership in israel asked her to that was in the newspaper that was in the washington post that she was asked by aipac and others not to do that

5532757 same country i think different judge i dont want to go any further with that
5532758 you want to go and ask her no idea theres not a single gymnast in the final over there
5532759 im a little disappointed you know i tied it wasnt that i got second by three or five tenths i had the same exact score and thats what makes it a little bit harder to take
5532760 you do your performance and you end and then you turn it over to someone elses hands weve gotten used to that and we just have to accept that
5532761 nothing against anyone from australia i dont want to start anything thats not my place to judge im just kind of stating the facts
5532762 if they cheat shame of them but we have no proof
5532763 all i wanted to do was tell parents that these little thugs are around and to not be intimidated by them but now everybody is contacting me friends media
5532764 i dont want any repercussions for my son or my family i dont think there will be but its possible
5532765 hes a typical 16 year old hes not telling me a lot but the school knox grammar school also contacted my son because the majority of kids at the party were from knox
5532766 but everybody is aware its me i walked into a shop the other day and someone said its you
5532767 i dont want to be portrayed as some sort of vigilante im no hero no vigilante i just did what i had to
5532768 look ive got a lot of support everybody is on my side but as i say i dont want any publicity
5532769 im not getting paid for it if i was getting paid it might be a different story excuse the pun
5532770 its a traditional african herdsmans whip its something that wont maim or kill you but it will bloody well hurt

5532772 shes just an attention seeker if she was serious she would not have pressed the emergency button
5532773 all of these experiences have been traumatic and damaging above and beyond the illness that im already suffering
5532774 i trust that you will take this matter seriously address this inexcusable behaviour and attitude and act to change the situation for the good of all the patients in the ward
5532775 you have to decide whether long term behavioural change is your goal or preventing suicide in order to prevent suicide you have to show empathy and compassion
5532776 i think he must have been pretty embarrassed were planning to frame the notice
5532777 this is a very young calf its probably two to three weeks old it absolutely needs its mother or another whale to adopt it
5532778 its heart wrenching normally whales stay very very close to their mothers theyre inseparable and they suckle for 11 months before being weaned
5532779 we managed to coax it out to sea yesterday by towing a yacht
5532780 the sad news is this morning its returned the last sighting was mackerel beach in pittwater
5532781 weve got some folks out there at the moment trying to assess its condition but the fact that it went out to sea yesterday there were whales in the vicinity but its come back in again its pretty sad news
5532782 it would suggest that its not been able to make contact with those whales or they werent interested in it
5532783 its probably a question of days rather than weeks its a very grim prognosis
5532784 some of my friends told me its a totally different course than no 4 and they said its pretty hard around the greens
5532785 all youve got to do is try to hit it on the center of the green im pretty good at that
5532786 i was hitting it so far offline that i had some good lies in the pine straw and on the packed down cart paths you name it i was on it i got it up and down from everywhere

5532834 que impulsa la privatizaci n y la tercerizaci n de su producci n
5532835 recomienda que el paisaje cultural de buenos aires argentina no sea inscripto en la lista de patrimonio mundial
5532836 dada la naturaleza din mica de los paisajes culturales urbanos el proceso de garantizar y determinar la autenticidad e integridad debe ser mantenido bajo constante revisi n para asegurar su evoluci n
5532837 icomos no considera demostrada la coherencia de la porci n urbana propuesta
5532838 en la presentaci n hay apenas explicaciones muy gen ricas de la integridad de la zona propuesta y no se explica en absoluto qu se quiere decir con completo o intacto esto se reemplaza con un nfasis en la heterogeneidad urbana y los diversos estratos culturales
5532839 icomos considera que la autenticidad de los paisajes culturales en evoluci n se relaciona con los procesos distintivos de interacci n entre las personas y su ambiente a lo largo del tiempo y tambi n a las expresiones f sicas distintivas de esa relaci n
5532840 en t rminos de procesos se propone que el dinamismo y el cambio continuo son lo que hacen especial a buenos aires icomos considera que estos atributos pueden encontrarse en muchas otras ciudades y adem s que son fuerzas demasiado gen ricas lo que hace a un paisaje cultural algo especial es lo especial de las fuerzas socioecon micas que impulsan el cambio
5532841 deben entenderse los par metros de cambio para que se puedan sostener ciertos atributos espec ficos
5532842 la propuesta relaciona la autenticidad del dise o arquitect nico al concepto de ciudad viva y se destaca su cambio continuo sin embargo no se discuten los l mites de este cambio a futuro ni se presenta evidencia detallada de los cambios de los ltimos cincuenta a os m s que en la afirmaci n de que hubo p rdidas significativas y una larga historia de da os aunque un gran n mero de edificios sigue en pie
5532843 icomos no considera que se haya demostrado la integridad y autenticidad del rea nominada
5532844 la debilidad de este an lisis comparativo proviene de la dificultad de determinar exactamente c mo buenos aires demuestra un valor universal especial como paisaje cultural
5532845 el icomos considera que el an lisis comparativo no es suficiente para demostrar un evidente valor universal
5532846 queda claro que las demoliciones son numerosas y que no parece haber ninguna intenci n de limitar de manera significativa el n mero de demoliciones
5532847 el problema es que a menos que se administre el cambio no hay garant as de que los muy importantes edificios del siglo 19 y temprano siglo 20 que reflejan modelos europeos sean preservados
5532848 ya se demoli mucho o fue muy alterado como los silos de bunge amp born uno de los m s importantes del mundo las galer as pac fico la sociedad rural el zool gico el abasto el palacio de correos y varios parques y plazas
5532849 los procesos de catalogaci n toman mucho tiempo y en el nterin los constructores aprovechan esa lentitud
5532850 el icomos considera que la protecci n legal es compleja pero no parece al momento ser coordinada adecuadamente a la necesidad de proteger el paisaje urbano en las zonas propuestas
5532851 el icomos considera que en resumen los mecanismos actuales de conservaci n apuntan a edificios individuales y no a la textura del paisaje

5532860 objections against christianity come from insubordination unwillingness to obey rebellion against all authority
5532861 the misfortune of our age in the political as well as in the religious sphere and in all things is disobedience unwillingness to obey and one deceives oneself and others by wishing to make us imagine that it is doubt no it is insubordination
5532862 the attitude of those who willingly suffer everything for their unquestioned faith and who obediently commit atrocities for it too

5532870 due anni fa votai per litalia dei valori soprattutto perch nel mio piemonte candidava franca rame persona straordinaria che sono felice di aver contribuito a mandare al senato credo proprio che anche stavolta torner a votare per il partito di antonio di pietro conosco le obiezioni dei critici la gestione padronale e personalistica del partito da cui molti si sono allontanati la caduta di stile di far prendere al partito una sede in affitto in uno stabile di propriet dello stesso di pietro la candidatura di personaggi come sergio de gregorio e federica rossi gasparrini puntualmente usciti dallidv dopo pochi mesi dallelezione ladesione di di pietro come ministro delle infrastrutture al progetto del tav per le merci in valsusa sia pure dialogando con le popolazioni e discutendo di un possibile nuovo tracciato alternativo al famigerato buco da 54 km a venaus la decisione di non chiudere la societ stretto di messina pur con la contrariet ribadita al progetto del ponte il no alla commissione parlamentare dinchiesta sui fatti del g8 secondo me sacrosanto visto che le commissioni parlamentari in italia servono a confondere le acque e a ostacolare le indagini della magistratura ma maldestramente motivato con la richiesta di indagare anche sulle violenze dei black bloc quasi che il parlamento dovesse occuparsi dei reati dei cittadini comuni per essere chiari voterei molto pi volentieri per un einaudi o un de gasperi redivivi ma in attesa che rinasca qualcuno di simile e riesca a entrare in politica penso che lastensione da cui sono stato a lungo tentato finisca col fare il gioco della casta anzi della cosca il non voto anche se massiccio non viene tenuto in minimo conto dalla partitocrazia anche se gli elettori fossero tre in tutto i partiti se li spartirebbero in percentuale per stabilire vincitori e vinti e infischiandosene degli assenti che alla fine hanno sempre torto dunque penso che si debba essere realisti votando non il meno peggio ma ci che si sente meno lontano dai propri desideri a convincermi a votare per lidv sono le liste che ha presentato di pietro che ospitano diverse persone di valore alcune delle quali sono amici miei di micromega dei girotondi e di chi ha combattuto in questi anni le battaglie per la legalit e la libert dinformazione ne cito alcuni beppe giulietti animatore dellassociazione articolo 21 contro ogni censura ed epurazione dunque scaricato dal pd che gli ha preferito addirittura marco follini ex segretario delludc ed ex vicepremier di berlusconi come responsabile per linformazione quel follini che ha votato tutte le leggi vergogna compresa la gasparri che il principale ostacolo alla libert dinformazione c pancho pardi che ho incontrato la prima volta al palavobis poi in tutti i girotondi e che mi auguro di reincontrare quando se come temo rivincer berlusconi ci toccher tornare in piazza c la baronessa teresa cordopatri simbolo della lotta alla ndrangheta in calabria c a napoli un sindaco anticamorra come franco barbato che ha militato nel progetto di lista civica nazionale insieme a tanti altri amici c leoluca orlando che in quanto ad antimafia non teme confronti non ci sono in compenso alcuni personaggi discutibili che si erano avvicinati allidv e che sono stati respinti o non ricandidati e poi ci sarebbero anche beppe lumia e nando dalla chiesa ai quali di pietro aveva offerto un posto nella sua lista in sicilia dopo lestromissione nel primo caso provvisoria nel secondo definitiva da quelle del pd che in compenso ospitano elementi come mirello crisafulli lamico del boss di enna alla fine grazie anche allidv lumia rientrato nel pd mentre nando ha rispettabilmente deciso di declinare lofferta e poi c di pietro che pur con tutti i suoi difetti ha saputo pronunciare da ministro e da leader di partito una serie di no molto pesanti contro le vergogne del centro sinistra no allindulto extralarge salva previti salva furbetti salva corrotti e salva mafiosi no al segreto di stato e al ricorso alla consulta sul sequestro abu omar contro i giudici di milano no alla depenalizzazione strisciante della bancarotta tentata da qualche ministro furbetto no agli attacchi contro de magistris e forleo no al salvataggio di previti alla camera il deputato idv belisario per un anno e mezzo stato il solo con il pdci a chiedere la cacciata del pregiudicato berlusconiano mentre gli altri facevano i pesci in barile no al salvataggio di dalema e latorre da parte della giunta per le autorizzazioni a procedere della camera l il dipietrista palomba s pronunciato per autorizzare le intercettazioni unipol antonveneta rcs senza se e senza ma no allinciucio mastelliano sulla controriforma dellordinamento giudiziario e a tutte le altre porcate del cosiddetto ministro della giustizia ceppalonico no allinciucio in commissione affari costituzionali per la legge truffa di franceschini e violante sul conflitto dinteressi anche qui solo il pdci con licandro e lallora ds giulietti han tenuto botta con lidv no alla limitazione delle intercettazioni telefoniche e no dopo uniniziale esitazione alla camera alla legge bavaglio di mastella amp c contro la pubblicazione delle intercettazioni e degli altri atti dindagine fino al processo no allaumento del finanziamento pubblico dei partiti e al colpo di mano tentato in tal senso dai tesorieri di tutti i partiti tranne quelli dellidv silvana mura e della rosa nel pugno fabrizio turco no al comma fuda che assicurava la prescrizione agli amministratori pubblici indagati dalla corte dei conti per infrazioni contabili come ministro delle infrastrutture poi di pietro ha bonificato quel lombrosario che era prima il vertice dellanas cacciando gli inquisiti e i condannati e denunciando i responsabili di certi ammanchi ha razionalizzato la miriade di progetti faraonici ereditati da lunardi concentrando le poche risorse disponibili su alcune opere davvero necessarie e in campagna elettorale stato il solo a dire papale papale che rete 4 deve andare sul satellite e che bisogna applicare immediatamente la sentenza dellalta corte di giustizia europea di lussemburgo che dichiarando illegittime le proroghe concesse a mediaset dal 1999 privano da nove anni europa 7 di francesco di stefano delle frequenze necessarie per trasmettere infine last but not least sia che vinca berlusconi sia che pdl e pd arrivino al pareggio e magari tentino un bel governissimo di larghe intese mi auguro che arrivi in parlamento una pattuglia di guastatori capaci di fare opposizione con fermezza e competenza sui due temi cruciali la libert dinformazione e la giustizia uguale per tutti di gente cos ce nera anche nel pd ma stata scientificamente eliminata con una specie di pulizia etnica ricordiamoci quel che accadde nel 2001 quando lidv manc il quorum per un soffio lunica vera opposizione al regime berlusconiano non era in parlamento a parte i cani sciolti alla dalla chiesa e alla de zulueta ora scomparsi dalle liste ma in piazza se stavolta entrano in parlamento di pietro orlando pardi giulietti cordopatri mura e qualcun altro come loro meglio per tutti

5532955 to come to a decision like that weve taken a lot of things into consideration last year how orton finished the season training camp preseason games
5532956 in the end it comes down to a gut feeling that you have
5532957 completions turnovers to just the feeling we have on who can manage the game the best for us all of things like that
5532958 and the good thing about evaluating both rex and kyle weve had a long time to do it its been quite a few years weve had a chance to see both guys play
5532959 people make such a big deal about that my rookie year and everything but i think everybody on this team has gotten better since they were a rookie and not just me
5532960 that stuffs in the past and im just focused on playing good football now
5532961 my accuracy has improved my command of the offense has improved and just being able to play at a high level
5532962 both guys were in the same situation which is a good part about it
5532963 both guys played both preseason games with the same line i think we did about what we could to let them compete fairly for the position
5532964 i wasnt even sure what the contract situation was to be honest
5532965 no competitor will agree with a decision when it doesnt go their way
5532966 rex is a team player hes been in this situation before and hell do whatever he needs to do to help our football team win
5532967 we dont name any guys starters for lifetime or anything like that but we feel real good about kyle just like we feel good about lance briggs being our linebacker
5532968 it is kind of frustrating wondering who the starting quarterback is

5532983 the bottoming out comes when people start buying homes normal homes
5532984 were all looking for good news and some kind of bottom but i just dont see it
5532985 all the others had no kitchens or bathrooms or the toilets were gone or there were holes in the walls
5532986 people can now afford the homes they couldnt have before

5533057 a lot of what hes trying to do is add value to a stranded asset hes obviously got millions of dollars on the line
5533058 when you guys said wild card thats the first time ive heard it
5533059 just keep playing we have a month and a half left
5533060 you have to look and see how like 15 teams are doing every day
5533061 most people around if they didnt know the standings and just watched sportscenter or read the paper youd think the second place team in the central had no chance at the wild card
5533062 it always just seems like they assume that whoever loses the al east will be the wild card but thats not the case if that happens at the end that we dont win the division and we get the wild card thats great too
5533063 it would be something if we made the playoffs with minnesota and tampa bay and not the other two big teams that always make it but well have to see how it plays out tampa is having a heck of a season
5533064 that was going to be right in the middle of a time we were playing a lot of games in a row so itll be nice
5533065 the good thing about it is that it is in september
5533066 we havent talked specifics about it but obviously pitchers will be the no 1 thing
5533067 first base is my best position because ive played there so much this year
5533068 but if i put the time in at third base theres no reason why i cant be successful there too
5533069 it doesnt really bother me if its not a short term move
5533070 you have to have blalocks bat in the lineup so if this is what it takes im willing to do that
5533071 my arm has very rarely bothered me in the past so i dont think ill have any problems handling it no matter how long im over there
5533072 um hey you know that one piece of code where
5533073 hey i hear you wrote this code and i have this
5533074 japan consumes 14 barrels of oil a year per capita
5533075 if china used the same amount per capita as parsimonious japan chinese consumption would total more than 18 billion barrels a year an amount that dwarfs our countrys 7 5 billion barrels
5533076 add that to new demand for oil stemming from india the newest members of the european community an increasingly prosperous brazil and so on for those trying to discern the long term future of oil prices this is considerable food for thought
5533077 in contemplating china we need to look past carefully crafted images and deepen our understanding of her national interest failure to do so will be perilous

5533085 cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you
5533086 the lord is near be anxious for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to god and the peace of god which surpasses all comprehension will guard your hearts and your minds in christ jesus
5533087 peace i leave with you my peace i give to you not as the world gives do i give to you do not let your heart be troubled nor let it be fearful

5533089 trust in him at all times o people pour out your heart before him god is a refuge for us
5533090 i think i had to do something to be fair to the team and to be fair to olson
5533091 olson needs to get some success and be put in a situation thats not as stressful and pressure packed as it would appear its been for him his last three starts
5533092 i think its a good move i think its a smart move
5533093 im not thinking im out of the rotation because i did terrible or anything like that im just taking it as i got my work in and i feel more comfortable now facing hitters i think its going to help me for the rest of this year and going into next year as a bullpen guy by just commanding the strike zone
5533094 to me anytime a manager shows he has confidence in you whether youre struggling or not it means a lot
5533095 it has been in the back of my mind that i havent been doing my job i tried to make adjustments its just being consistent has been hard this year ive showed brief blips of it but i need to have it more especially to help the team out
5533096 but because i extended fernando cabrera yesterday to three innings i extended lance cormier and i pitched jamie walker two innings i need some help in the bullpen the next couple nights until we get through this series against boston well keep what we have here and then on wednesday i might have something more for you i dont think anything has been finally decided
5533097 ive kind of missed those guys i missed the conversations but most of all i think thats going to be me in the future once i get to the point where im not walking guys im attacking hitters and im at the top of my game im going to be a closer type guy with my stuff i take it as a working thing to get me where i need to be
5533098 i dont know if hes lost confidence so much as the fact that hes just as beside himself as we are
5533099 he works very hard in between starts his preparation is very good he had two good starts against seattle and the time before that he pitched very good since then he didnt get past the third or fourth i dont think so what 20 some starts and i dont know how many quality ones so we need to try to help him and thats what were going to try and do try to put him in a situation that may be a little more beneficial to him and the team
5533100 this is what i do this is baseball you prepare yourself for what you are going to experience i dont know how to say this and i want to say this in the right way
5533101 there are a lot of things in life more important than attention so when i say im prepared for whatever happens in this game i say that having experienced lows in this game like every player and you experience good things im not going to be frightened by anything if thats what you are saying
5533102 its weird that he generates so much power out of the stance he has but hes strong he looks like a great young power hitter
5533103 as far as im concerned carlos quentin has been the american league mvp
5533104 as far as im concerned quentin has been the american league mvp
5533105 obviously you dream to do something like that in your career
5533106 you want to set a goal to be the best something like that is far from my mind i hear it mentioned once in a while but i kind of laugh and push it off to the side
5533107 its not something you go out there thinking im going to win that or do something like that
5533108 im pretty straightforward and honest i say whats on my mind i just have things that i have to do i have a job and its playing major league baseball its my first and foremost priority
5533109 it took me a little to get to this point i was stiff and hurting right now im not feeling any pain it feels good to be back in the hitting motion
5533110 part of that is he can do two a days with a guy in miami the other thing is fenway is closed for a couple of days he wanted to go and we had no problem because we know what hes going to do hell come back and get evaluated and if hes baseball ready come to toronto if not hell meet us in new york
5533111 this will be a hard one as we proceed to gauge because hes going to lie
5533112 thats part of the reason hes good he hurt it during that at bat he couldnt swing until the third strike but he didnt say anything thats part of the reason hes a good player i know that may sound backwards good players kind of will themselves to do things that maybe they shouldnt be able to do
5533113 personalmente preferir a no tener una casa as de cerca del gasoducto
5533114 okay how can we make this so that it works perfectly and we can also extend it for unknown requirements in the future
5533115 write down exactly how youre going to implement an entire project from here until 2010
5533116 i need some code that i can use in any program anywhere that will communicate between any computer and any other computer using any medium imaginable
5533117 okay pressure like this is going to happen in the future how can i make things simpler now to avoid things like that in the future
5533118 already there are advocates saying that injection sites are not enough that government should hand out heroin for free
5533119 others are now calling for inhalation rooms for people who smoke their drugs while i support various aspects of harm reduction i believe that we have to draw the line somewhere with regard to these kinds of measures
5533120 is it ethical for health care professionals to support the administration of drugs that are of unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed
5533121 in this way the supervised injection site undercuts the ethics of medical practice and sets a debilitating example for all physicians and nurses both present and future in canada who might begin to question whether its ok to allow someone to overdose under their care
5533122 we specifically take issue with the minister using that phrase
5533123 the minister was off base in calling into question the ethics of physicians involved in harm reduction
5533124 its clear that this was being used as a political issue
5533125 i found the use of medical ethics to justify a political decision which will affect social policy to be troubling at best and misleading at worst
5533126 ethics consist of a balancing of rights and harms as do all medical decisions that physicians in this room help their patients reach every day iv drug users as the rest of us have the right to compassion and to access and care which has proven to be beneficial
5533127 there is not enough evidence for who to provide global guidance to member states on safe injection facilities
5533128 we have to do more to reach out to our own sons and daughters who are overdosing in the downtown eastside
5533129 they need our compassion and they need our intervention not help simply to shoot up
5533130 we know that if people have a safe place that they can talk to people that they eventually will come off drugs they eventually will get help and that they dont die
5533131 this guy clement is insulting physicians and the nurses that are working hard in the trenches of helping people get off drugs
5533132 jaag jao aye kafiron kashmir hamara chhor do wake up you non believers and leave our kashmir

5533142 and if no one is listening then it is because they dont want to hear because this is a referendum people dont need anyone to represent them they are representing themselves as somebody who has followed peoples movements and who has been in rallies and at the heart or the edge of things i dont think you can dispute what you see here
5533143 since the 1930s there have been debates and disputes about who has the right to represent the kashmiri people whether it was hari singh or sheikh abdullah or someone else and the debate continues till today whether it is the hurriyat or some other party

5533152 irrigating with waste water isnt a rare practice limited to a few of the poorest countries
5533153 its a widespread phenomenon occurring on 20 million hectares 50 million acres across the developing world especially in asian countries like china india and vietnam but also around nearly every city of sub saharan africa and in many latin american cities
5533154 that gives you an idea of the large potential of waste water agriculture for both helping and hurting great numbers of urban consumers
5533155 of costs for providing clean water around the world go toward corruption

5533169 not really people have been staring at me since i got here
5533170 i dont get it usually people are staring at me
5533171 well you know i look a little different after all
5533172 i dont get it i mean youre dark and theyre dark so i dont see the big deal
5533173 one of these things is not like the others one of these things doesnt belong
5533174 now this whole musharraf excuse is behind us now people are going to be focusing on their performance
5533175 we believe that respect for the democratic and constitutional processes in that country is fundamental to pakistans future and its fight against terrorism
5533176 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more
5533177 he even tried to deceive the nation in his last address he was boasting about economic progress when life for people like us has become a hell
5533178 we are currently reviewing planned activity for tomorrow with the aim of resuming some outpatient clinics

5533182 i can indicate from the outset that all these charges will be strenuously defended
5533183 im shocked and saddened that its got this far in terms of all the allegations and charges im determined more than ever to fight to clear my name
5533184 it has been incredibly difficult and incredibly frustrating watching this entire saga play out in public i can honestly say i am absolutely relieved now there is clarity going forward and i know now what im up against
5533185 i now look forward to every chance and possibility for all information and all of the facts to be played out in the appropriate forum there are two sides to every story and i guarantee that will come out in the end
5533186 if she wants to live by the sword then she must be willing to die by it

5533200 weve got a lot of people here who need help we cant just throw them out on the street
5533201 theyre our family theyve made their homes here had jobs here raised families here
5533202 this town has constantly been changing it had opened its heart to change but now i sense anguish within people
5533203 they are asking whats going to happen to the town
5533204 a lot of good workers were taken away a lot of good families are gone
5533205 the community is drained of our giving energy of wondering how long the new people will stay if it will be a culture that fits into our community we are grieving scared apprehensive
5533206 i am very nervous i dont know what is going to happen and i dont know if i have the strength to keep fighting
5533207 i wish i could plead with the judge for my childrens sake that he would give me a little more time here so my children could continue studying so i could keep working
5533208 you come here with so many plans and illusions that your children will do better than you did
5533209 what joy that gives me to hear i see that they could have a future
5533210 it wounds my soul to think that i might not be able to give them what they desire to think that i might fail them
5533211 i wish people could put themselves in our situation for one moment what would they do if they were poor if they were in dire need wouldnt they risk coming here as well
5533212 i wish that the hearts of people with hearts of stone of ice the people of ice could be transformed into good hearts we came here to work not to do harm to anyone
5533213 they are serious offenses and we will not apologize for enforcing the nations laws if 305 u s citizens had committed identity theft and misuse of social security numbers would people expect us to look the other way
5533214 any disruption whether to families or communities should be put at the feet of those who violate the law
5533215 what happened here is a microcosm of whats happening in the country
5533216 if nothing is done there will be many many more postvilles around the country and thats not healthy for anyone
5533217 i hope our little town will survive i think it will
5533218 weve gotten through lots of things and well get through this too itll take awhile and its tough but were just a resilient bunch in iowa

5533227 el terrorismo que amenaza estados unidos est ubicado en el noroeste de pakist n y en afganist n y no en irak
5533228 deber a centrarse en asegurar que el gobierno paquistan tenga los elementos necesarios para acabar con los refugios de al qaeda y de los talib n

5533241 we dont necessarily have a funding plan what we have is history

5533243 while it has been a very difficult week i believe the end result is a very positive step forward for the galaxy
5533244 bruce is the best coach for the galaxy and certainly one of the best coaches in the history of the league i am impressed with his passion desire and focus and believe that his recent experiences with the u s national team and red bulls have prepared and motivated him for this next challenge
5533245 we have always felt that the galaxy should aspire to be the club that sets the pace and tone in major league soccer
5533246 i believe bruce sees it the same way and will put us back in that position
5533247 i am very excited to assume this position with the los angeles galaxy
5533248 i realize we have a lot of work ahead of us and i am optimistic that with the support of management our coaching staff and the players we will move forward to positioning this team to qualify for this seasons mls playoffs my ultimate goal is to win championships and build a club that all of our fans will be proud of
5533249 i want to thank mr anschutz and mr leiweke for their confidence and support and i pledge that i and my staff will do everything possible to build a team they will be proud of

5533251 the projections in the ocs outer continental shelf access case indicate that access to the pacific atlantic and eastern gulf regions would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030 leasing would begin no sooner than 2012 and production would not be expected to start before 2017
5533252 mr obama appeared to misstate his position in the cbn interview on saturday obamas campaign yesterday acknowledged that he had voted against an identical bill in the state senate
5533253 the act would effectively grant legal personhood to a pre viable fetus in direct conflict with roe in proposing this bill anti choice lawmakers are seeking to ascribe rights to fetuses at any stage of development thereby directly contradicting one of roes basic tenets
5533254 a live child born as a result of an abortion shall be fully recognized as a human person and accorded immediate protection under the law
5533255 number one whenever we define a previable fetus as a person that is protected by the equal protection clause or the other elements in the constitution what were really saying is in fact that they are persons that are entitled to the kinds of protections that would be provided to a a child a nine month old child that was delivered to term that determination then essentially if it was accepted by a court would forbid abortions to take place i mean it it would essentially bar abortions because the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child and if this is a child then this would be an antiabortion statute
5533256 nothing in this section shall be construed to affirm deny expand or contract any legal status or legal right applicable to any member of the species homo sapiens at any point prior to being born alive as defined in this section
5533257 obama said that had he been in the u s senate two years ago he would have voted for the born alive infants protection act even though he voted against a state version of the proposal the federal version was approved the state version was not the difference between the state and federal versions obama explained was that the state measure lacked the federal language clarifying that the act would not be used to undermine roe vs wade the 1973 u s supreme court opinion that legalized abortion
5533258 senator obama says if he had been in the u s senate in 2002 he too would have voted in favor of the born alive infant protection act because unlike the illinois bill it included language protecting roe v wade
5533259 said he had opposed the bill because it was poorly drafted and would have threatened the supreme court decision in roe v
5533260 indeed mr obama appeared to misstate his position in the cbn interview on saturday when he said the federal version he supported was not the bill that was presented at the state level his campaign yesterday acknowledged that he had voted against an identical bill in the state senate
5533261 a live child born as a result of an abortion shall be fully recognized as a human person and accorded immediate protection under the law
5533262 coal burning leaves toxic heavy metal legacy in the arctic
5533263 conventional wisdom held that toxic heavy metals were higher in the 1960s and 70s the peak of industrial activity in europe and north america and certainly before implementation of clean air act controls in the early 1970s
5533264 but it turns out pollution in southern greenland was higher 100 years ago when north american and european economies ran on coal before the advent of cleaner more efficient coal burning technologies and the switch to oil and gas based economies
5533265 contamination of other sectors may be increasing because of the rapid coal driven growth of asian economies
5533266 their performance and professionalism during a high pressure and dangerous situation is to be commended

5533270 put trust in the board of supervisors that every effort would be made not to start lighting darden towe
5533271 this is different from other things that might be talked about
5533272 lighting the courts and lighting the fields are two completely separate issues

5533283 as it is written there is none righteous no not one
5533284 for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god
5533285 for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord
5533286 but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord
5533287 but god commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us much more then being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him
5533288 whoever will call on the name of the lord will be saved
5533289 the grassroots finance committee sent a letter to me after i reached my goal for everything ive given the campaign the campaign gives back with their appreciation
5533290 creative exuberance and an institutional mindset crucial to the day to day running of the country
5533291 the teaching language needs to support or focus on the more basic concepts and that may be slightly different to what is going on now
5533292 nobody is disputing the fact that you need language to build a more complicated set of ideas but language isnt the starter kit
5533293 there is a clear basis on which children can build but it isnt a linguistic basis
5533294 we are unlikely to vote against that tax we think its a bad decision and has sovereign risk implications but given the revenue involved we are unlikely to vote against it
5533295 we are going to wait for the senate report but from day one weve had concerns about the impact on private health and public hospitals
5533296 on alcopops our position is clear we think its a revenue raising exercise its got nothing to do with binge drinking
5533297 by abolishing the statutory definition of marriage and reducing marriage and de facto relationships to the same category the bill fails to acknowledge and respect the unique cultural significance of marriage

5533313 even though this storm doesnt look like its very dangerous and people will say its just a tropical storm or its just a category one hurricane our experience with florida tells us that if were not careful we will lose people
5533314 we have amazing waves today something not seen very often on this beaches its a perfect day
5533315 we will redouble our efforts and try to use our achievements on the field to encourage the people of the disaster areas to rebuild their lives
5533316 never seen so many chinese flags waving in central seoul not even during the korean war
5533317 why couldnt the parisians londoners and san franciscans be more like the north koreans
5533318 its a bright and colorful day for everybody in the city the flame brings friendship best wishes and passion to pyongyang
5533319 olympic torch run not a bright and colorful day in both koreas

5533322 imma fuck you up bitch and if i dont i dont give a fuck
5533323 im worried that students will take their obedient place in society and look to become successful cogs in the wheel let the wheel spin them around as it wants without taking a look at what theyre doing
5533324 somedays i just get so pissed off that i want to be out there doing something but my time my efforts will have such a little impact life is so short i want to do the fun things too like having dinner with you
5533325 you must be the change you want to see in the world
5533326 if those in charge of our society politicians corporate executives and owners of press and television can dominate our ideas they will be secure in their power
5533327 senator obama which existing supreme court justice would you not have nominated
5533328 but scalia you know hes smart white guy but i still dont agree with him
5533329 justice ginsburg meanwhile a liberal favorite on the court whom john mccain listed as one of his least favorite justices during the same forum opposed giving child rapists the death penalty so whats so wrong about thomas and so right about say ginsberg senator obama explain the logic he cant of course and still win an election which is why he agreed with thomas
5533330 obama took a lower road replying first that thats a good one and then adding that i would not have nominated clarence thomas
5533331 meanwhile obama isnt yet four years out of the illinois state senate has never held a hearing of note of his us senate subcommittee and had an unremarkable record as both a community organizer and law school lecturer justice thomas judicial credentials compare favorably to mr obamas presidential resume by any measure and when it comes to rising from difficult circumstances justice thomass rural georgian upbringing makes mr obamas story look like easy street
5533332 even more troubling is what the illinois democrats answer betrays about his political habits of mind asked a question he didnt expect at a rare unscripted event he didnt merely say he disagreed with justice thomas instead he instinctively reverted to the leftwing cliche that the courts black conservative isnt up to the job while his white conservative colleagues are

5533335 bruce is the best coach for the galaxy and certainly one of the best coaches in the history of the league
5533336 we have always felt that the galaxy should aspire to be the club that sets the pace and tone in major league soccer i believe bruce sees it the same way and will put us back in that position
5533337 it was just cramp i should be training with the team tomorrow
5533338 i am really glad that is not a bad injury i am looking forward to joining in training tomorrow and getting on with playing
5533339 overall i am really pleased with how pre season has gone for me and then to get off to a good start in the first game especially with two goals hopefully i can keep that going on sunday
5533340 obviously we would have liked another day to play the game but with the hurricane coming in we had to play tonight
5533341 i think we learned a lot more in this game than we would in a training session i give them u 17 venezuela national team credit too they were expecting to play tomorrow as well
5533342 i was happy with some guys and other guys need to do keep trying to do better
5533343 we are starting to see some good things happen and i am pleased to see where were at right now
5533344 its a good feeling to score a goal in preseason its a good way to start the season
5533345 staging your comeback a complete beauty revival for women over 45
5533346 a lot of women figure out what works in their 20s and early 30s but those things all change
5533347 but you dont really have the time or interest to go back to glamour magazine and read all the articles i give women the tools and techniques for their second act
5533348 this is where you tell me how i dont know how thin fine and stick straight your hair is
5533349 i do but no you shouldnt need one if you have the right haircut
5533350 hair should be in proportion to your face and to the rest of you save the very big or the very flat hair for the very young and proportionate balanced fullness and shape will help lift an aging face and body
5533351 youre always pulling it back and rarely wear it down you keep fluffing it whenever you look in the mirror you know better but youre doing it for your husband
5533352 dewy just looks shiny to me it is pretty on younger skin but it only seems to reveal the pores and wrinkles on older skin
5533353 having your brows tweezed where you need less and penciled or powdered where you need more will make the biggest difference not only now but as you age next to a good bra its the best thing you can do for a lift
5533354 bright or dark lipstick is aging soft natural and pale lips are more youthful if you want to draw attention to your teeth the lines near your mouth or your softening jawline by all means go for bright or dark lipstick
5533355 next time youre wearing a low cut top look straight in the mirror and cross your arms if you dont see crepe paper crinkling give yourself the cleavage permit if you see excessive vertical lines its time to rethink
5533356 she couldnt care less about hair and makeup when it was time for makeup she closed her eyes let me do it and went back to work she knew to get where i need to go these are the things i need to do
5533357 goldie hawn there is a tipping point to cosmetic help and shes kind of well tipped id love to see who goldie has become rather than a repeat version of who she used to be
5533358 the biggest mistake is women who dont do enough they dont wear any makeup and dont do anything to their hair in florida they do too much its all about balance balancing your hair and your makeup and your clothes to your body type and to who you are now
5533359 it could have formed like pluto in the belt of icy debris beyond neptune then been kicked to large distance by a gravitational encounter with neptune or uranus however we think it is more probable that sq372 comes from the inner edge of the oort cloud

5533362 i got on and sat my beautiful glutes in a row of two unused seats facing forward taking the window seat its a good thing too because a perfectly poundable asian pussy rested its lips on the seat next to me
5533363 86 3 percent of income taxes while the bottom 80 percent paid a collective 13 7 percent of the income tax burden
5533364 i hear a lot complaining about the recalcitrant it and web people here theyre prickly theyre unambitious they dont care about beauty i realize now after about a year and a half of getting better at web design and administration that they have it exactly right every new project particularly with people who dont know much about the technical specifics of web work is a promise to put up with months and months of minor demands as youre obliged to become a perfectionist on behalf of everyone youve agreed to work for you need to be prickly and unambitious particularly in an institutional context because the people who come to you arent clients and they can make as much additional work as it crosses their mind to without worrying about paying you overtime and theres no point in passionately worrying over beauty because youre not building a site for the tiny bejeweled snow globe universe of people who really care about awesome gradient fills just make sure its standards compliant has legible typography and is easy to change because youll be making a lot of changes its about the data and everything else is time consuming frosting
5533365 im clear absolutely 100 percent clear and clean they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer
5533366 i was so mad and i i just remember i was i was just shaking

5533415 opening the door of the political process to people who have never taken part in the past has been the bedrock of our planning for this convention since we arrived in denver one year ago
5533416 twelve months and 56 primaries and caucuses later its only fitting that our delegates represent that same core value and barack obamas unparalleled ability to bring more new people in to the electoral process than ever before young and old first timers and convention veterans all representing a broad spectrum of backgrounds and communities this is a delegation that will bring americas voices to denver
5533417 in just days delegates will come together in denver to conduct the most important business of the convention nominating barack obama as our partys nominee for the next president of the united states
5533418 as we gather in denver to change the course of our nation we will truly represent the strength and diversity of our party and our country

5533426 good work usually arises when the creators seem to have no ambitions towards gilt culture but are involved in a kind of squandering beaverish endeavor that isnt anywhere or anything it goes always forward eating its own boundaries and likely as not leaves nothing in its path other than the signs of eager industrious unkempt activity

5533430 hes provided so much wonderful creative input to us on our show
5533431 it makes total sense to us that hed do this job hes been so significantly responsible for the quality of the shows made by touchstone and abc studios
5533432 that two hour season finale has become a staple of our show and many other series

5533440 is any man afraid or fainthearted let him go home so that his brothers will not become disheartened too
5533441 this son of ours is stubborn and rebellious he will not obey us he is a profligate and a drunkard
5533442 i married this woman but when i approached her i did not find proof of her virginity
5533443 i gave my daughter in marriage to this man but he dislikes her 17 now he has slandered her and said i did not find your daughter to be a virgin but here is the proof of my daughters virginity
5533444 i did give documents a long time ago but these matters have been resolved for a long time now as far as im concerned
5533445 i think that our system is trying to treat everybody under a particular brand and it doesnt work
5533446 and because of that were creating housing problems were creating employment problems were creating community problems and its needless and its not warranted
5533447 i understand how everybody deserves a second chance and all but im not willing to risk my children and my neighbors to find out if theyre rehabilitated or not
5533448 every now and then you get on facebook and you have people you see and youre like wow i went to school with them and they never said a single word to me and now theyre trying to be my friend i think its funny
5533449 canada congratulates the afghan people and their government as they celebrate their national day so much has been achieved as afghans have worked to rebuild their country fully supported by the international community and the un mandated mission to which canadian men and women have so proudly contributed
5533450 the afghan people can continue to count on canada as we change the focus of our engagement in afghanistan from security to development and diplomacy with an emphasis on kandahar province
5533451 we should help the afghans celebrate their independence by marking the national day next year by withdrawing the last of our troops from the region
5533452 our presence in afghanistan is not achieving national security objectives it looks more and more like an expensive nation building entanglement that is costing lives
5533453 canadas signature projects of education polio eradication and repair of the dahla dam are testimony to our enduring commitment to improve the quality of afghan lives while deepening our partnership with the afghan government
5533454 i dont hear clear statements from this government about specific national security objectives i hear fluffy rhetoric about development in afghanistan but i dont hear how our daily efforts in the region are making life for canadians safer
5533455 our canadian forces are making an immense sacrifice to bring security to the people of afghanistan all the while protecting canadas values
5533456 whats next will harper send soldiers to the netherlands to force them to shut down their red light districts while i would like to see western values dominate the world we can not and should not do that militarily to kill someone to make them live more like us is counterproductive to say the least
5533457 the globe and mail reported yesterday that in an open letter the taliban threatened to kill more canadians if canadian troops do not pull out of afghanistan
5533458 whats next will harper send soldiers to the netherlands to force them to shut down their red light districts
5533459 to kill someone to make them live more like us is counterproductive to say the least
5533460 we talked about our friends families our resistance posture and that our country didnt seem to have the will to win
5533461 it would help us endure what we had to endure but we knew god wasnt going to come down and wave a magic wand
5533462 the john mccain who bragged about cracking down on lobbyists and corruption in 2000 wouldnt even consider voting for the john mccain who is accepting money raised by one of the central figures in the republican culture of corruption and brags about how proud he is of the lobbyists running his campaign
5533463 john mccain likes to call himself a reformer on the campaign trail but the facts show mccain is just another washington insider playing the same old broken politics no matter how you cut it john mccain cannot be counted on to bring change to washington

5533479 only these meetings never materialized until about a month later
5533480 unfortunately the oil and gas industry has launched a frenzied attack on these balanced common sense protections that are so important to protecting the publics health
5533481 hope springs eternal that wise individuals and cool heads will be able to work something out
5533482 here we are at the beginning of an unprecedented energy boom with very few protections for the public health at all
5533483 our states clean air our clean water our healthy communities are by far and away the most important economic assets to our state
5533484 didnt i tell you earlier all god speaks and only what he speaks i speak
5533485 the love chronicles was germinating in my head for a good two and a half years
5533486 there were songs i started writing just as the first record was tapering off and the funny thing is that the first song i wrote ended up being the first single lay it on the line i dont know how or what the inspiration was at the time it hit me but i know that that was the start of something the fact that it happened and i was like wow this is kinda cool and then i think that song spawned the idea in my head that i really wanted to put something together thatd be a trip through different periods of soul music
5533487 despite a slight chilling effect the types of events you can hold really hasnt changed very much
5533488 its just a question of adhering to the new guidance
5533489 the truth is the ethics changes havent affected our parties very much
5533490 we want to showcase our fine products and be 100 percent within the rules and the law
5533491 if those parties prove to be a problem then we can revisit it when we do the ethics rules next year
5533492 due to the very late end to the primary season
5533493 had the effect of making people more thoughtful and more careful
5533494 but at the end of the day the application and interpretation of those rules may allow a fairly significant amount of entertainment at most of these events
5533495 that other 2 3rds wasnt just leisure or whatever it was i was constantly always asking hey whats going on in your country here they want to get out of that country they want to leave they cant
5533496 this is something we talked about forever hes alex macks backup
5533497 we wanted to make sure we felt good about him at center then try him at guard thats kind of been the evolution of it he started playing a little bit of guard here a little bit of guard there until it finally got to the point where he was the best guard
5533498 alex is a great mentor my first few years here i just tried to learn from him he does everything right hes an all american and hopefully is going to have a great career in the nfl ive just tried to learn from him and try to get myself better
5533499 hes competed at guard and taken a major step forward
5533500 hes always had a great attitude worked really hard im really happy to see it
5533501 we have a lot of guys hurt right now at that position so its a good time to see what he can do
5533502 the water temperature everything was pretty good there we just got unlucky
5533503 i was looking forward to getting a lot of laps under our belt here and getting comfortable and making sure everything was together underneath me and we were going to have a great day
5533504 it just didnt work out its just experience so its just hard thats whats bad about this deal here

5533508 certainly now what we want to see in pakistan is a period of political stability to enable the government and the parliament of pakistan to address the serious issues that pakistan faces including security issues

5533515 key drivers for the rest of our business namely capacity demand and the cost of fuel remain highly volatile
5533516 based on current market conditions and fuel prices a positive result for the current financial year is expected but remains a challenge
5533517 the operating environment during the next 12 months is expected to be the most challenging the virgin blue group which now comprises virgin blue pacific blue polynesian blue and vaustralia has experienced to date
5533518 with fuel costs at never before seen record highs for much of the year and airlines around the world struggling to cope this result is a testament to our team and business model
5533519 we have implemented a range of measures in recent months to mitigate the impact of increased fuel costs
5533520 we will continue to closely monitor the operating environment and take whatever actions are necessary to see our way through what is expected to be a challenging period
5533521 dividends in relation to the 2009 financial year will be considered in the context of industry conditions prevailing at the time

5533663 he looked forward to being a wonderful husband to his wife april and having children of his own
5533664 he was only 19 but he was no longer just a teenager he had become a determined young man clear thinking and motivated
5533665 he knew that we all recognized this and he knew how proud we all were of him
5533666 this is a very young calf its probably two to three weeks old it absolutely needs its mother or another whale to adopt it
5533667 its heart wrenching normally whales stay very very close to their mothers theyre inseparable and they suckle for 11 months before being weaned
5533668 we managed to coax it out to sea yesterday by towing a yacht
5533669 the sad news is this morning its returned the last sighting was mackerel beach in pittwater
5533670 weve got some folks out there at the moment trying to assess its condition but the fact that it went out to sea yesterday there were whales in the vicinity but its come back in again its pretty sad news
5533671 it would suggest that its not been able to make contact with those whales or they werent interested in it
5533672 its probably a question of days rather than weeks its a very grim prognosis

5533680 i think every day that goes by without the companies raising capital the possibility of the treasury stepping in increases
5533681 restore to each of the founding peoples a rough sense of equivalence and possibility
5533682 rebuild the past out of the materials of the present
5533683 drawing the south together in a network of ancestral energy
5533684 white and red paths were never solid states but expressions of contingent and evolving relationships
5533685 insisting on difference they could obliterate creeping similarities and propinquities and humanities
5533686 stepped into a landscape that had been in the making for millennia
5533687 i miss those days and so i pout like a grown jerk wishin all i had to do now was finish homework its true you dont realize really what you got til its gone and im not gonna sing another sad song but sometimes i do sit and reminisce then think about the years i was raised back in the days
5533688 when i stepped on campus something in my gut said dude this is where you belong
5533689 going to be dr ahmad ali lewis the first rapper with a phd
5533690 rapping and teaching are not that far apart youre rapping youre talking youre a professor youre talking
5533691 i always thought i was better than average that i was handsome smart and talented it was a trick
5533692 being black in america from the ghetto you need that extra little bit of confidence so thats kind of my mission to give other kids that kind of confidence

5533695 and just mindlessly suggesting that they go back is like telling an abused spouse to go back to her husband
5533696 but what i say is that god and the church arent the same thing the church has gotten this and many other things wrong god hasnt gotten it wrong
5533697 i was shocked to see he is not supportive of this
5533698 i thought him being an advocate on health and everything i thought this would have been a natural thing for him to support for him to not even give it the opportunity have a broader discussion is very puzzling to me
5533699 this is clearly not a a high priority for the people of san jose we just want through a six month community based budget process setting priorities and making decisions about how we spend time and money and this never came up
5533700 i think we have a lot of serious issues facing san jose right now
5533701 this is something that is going to take away from the real work that needs to be done
5533702 you told me never to open the door but theyre saying you were in an accident
5533703 well its parked on your next door neighbors lawn pal totaled somebody hit it
5533704 whoever hit your car had to have a lot of damage himself
5533705 probably came out of one of the local bars stoned and then sped down the avenue
5533706 then when he came over that hinkey rise the first car in his way was yours and he was going too fast and he was too wasted to slow down and just rammed into your car at top speed and shoved it all the way up onto her lawn shes the one who called us
5533707 jika orangtuanya tidak merokok tentu uang itu bisa untuk dibayarkan pendidikan anaknya
5533708 i could get rid of all the books but a couple of attorneys here still like them
5533709 clients are looking for more efficiencies and more value added service and this
5533710 everyone is saying the biggest challenge we face is cost reduction and cost containment but i think whats really different now is our opportunity to be part of the revenue stream rather than a back office cost
5533711 were taking an active role for example in competitive intelligence and can now calculate our return on investment putting dollar amounts not only on what we do but what we bring in
5533712 partners dont want 1 000 pages of printouts they want us to read it and synthesize it ourselves
5533713 and retrieve content on a topic industry or company and then filter it to suit their needs
5533714 competitive intelligence is a lot of work requiring us even to go off site to academic and other libraries and the staff will neglect their other stuff
5533715 your reward for being good is more work but at the same time its hard to get an increase in staff
5533716 whenever it staff needs new staff they get it but theres always a reluctance to hire more in the library
5533717 its hard to make the argument that we need more staff if they see the work coming from marketing and not from us
5533718 the publishers that are new to the industry tend to be better offering simple licensing terms and reasonable pricing
5533719 weve considered putting dollar signs next to each source like in a restaurant review
5533720 weve used analytics to figure out just how expensive a service really is and well show that to the vendors
5533721 often theyll then come up with a solution perhaps giving us a discount or building a better interface to increase usage sometimes well just discontinue use
5533722 you no longer have each lawyer doing their own search duplicating efforts and fees
5533723 they just seemed hungrier this time much more willing to negotiate
5533724 one of the vendors said they simply would not negotiate
5533725 we called in an outside person he analyzed the contract got it down even more than we had pushed for
5533726 some of these consultants are like junkyard dogs very difficult people
5533727 they may know that another firm got a better deal and theyll give you a sense of what you can and cant get
5533728 some vendors will offer you a better deal if you agree not to bring in a third party
5533729 and if we think were getting a reasonable offer we wont bring them in
5533730 i dont know why we cowered before were the customer
5533731 in the last year or two and certainly in 2008 weve become extremely aggressive
5533732 were not like marketing where its just in their blood to toot their horn
5533733 but we can no longer just sit around and wait for the rest of the world to recognize us like it or not were in the business world now
5533734 so i was talking to this little girl catherine the daughter of some friends and she said she wanted to be president some day both of her parents liberal democrats were standing there with us and i
5533735 no i just read the first entry you write too much
5533736 why ruin all of the great choices youve made with pancakes

5533740 hundreds of people were out on the sidewalk dancing yelling having a good time
5533741 police were trying to control people and clear the streets and thats when it got out of control
5533742 hundreds of people were out on the sidewalk dancing yelling having a good time
5533743 police were trying to control people and clear the streets and thats when it got out of control
5533744 many years ago i hung out in the elmhurst area with a friend of mine who lived there we went to clubs and played baseball on 91st st near the airport
5533745 anything like this is nice i think its wonderful that events like these are held by the nyc department of parks and recreation so that folks can come out and enjoy themselves
5533746 you dont have to go down to the unemployment office any more either
5533747 i found out you can file for unemployment on your computer
5533748 itll be one of the slowest days of the year and i think it just kind of fed into itself
5533749 promote better understanding of the countrys recent political social and economic developments
5533750 the man who can make hard things easy is the educator
5533751 coaches have to watch for what they dont want to see and listen to what they dont want to hear
5533752 a good coach will make his players see what they can be rather than what they are
5533753 you put a ten horse and by ten i mean on a scale from 1 10 out with a 1 rider again on a scale of 1 10 and you have a 5 ride however you put a 10 horse and 10 rider out and what are your odds
5533754 the quality of a persons life is in direct proportion to their commitment to excellence regardless of their chosen field of endeavor
5533755 the price of success is hard work dedication to the job at hand and the determination that whether we win or lose we have applied the best of ourselves to the task at hand
5533756 the dictionary is the only place that success comes before work hard work is the price we must pay for success i think you can accomplish anything if youre willing to pay the price
5533757 the only yardstick for success our society has is being a champion no one remembers anything else
5533758 one man practicing sportsmanship is far better than fifty preaching it
5533759 one teacher teaching is better than fifty saying they do
5533760 the man who can make hard things easy is the educator
5533761 i dont think it was that raging but its all a matter of perspective i guess
5533762 we are currently reviewing planned activity for tomorrow with the aim of resuming some outpatient clinics
5533763 patients will be notified whether they are to come to their appointment or whether it has been postponed
5533764 its long and narrow and i dont even want to see it
5533765 you need to relax lets watch a movie how about
5533766 i want to see the data i want to see the valid scientific links made
5533767 to teach consumers how to drink coke and how to love coke
5533768 there are very few people in china who dont support the olympics
5533769 thats something that a mass market brand like coke wants to be involved in
5533770 for me to be dreaming up what would be happening in 2007 and 2008 i think some people thought i was somewhat crazy
5533771 what coke realized early on is that their competition wasnt just pepsi it was the other olympic sponsors
5533772 how was your dinner shuang how was that ride on the roller coaster shuang i say shuang about a thousand times per day
5533773 were simply joining the fun and supporting china at a very exciting time
5533774 cannot drink cold coca cola its not good for my stomach
5533775 we are a better company as a result of supporting the olympics and the olympics are a better movement as a result of our support
5533776 we grabbed the volume control and took it all the way down to zero and gradually found a way to bring it back to celebratory
5533777 hey ive had enough of being stationary i believe this would be a good time to pull myself
5533778 here here you look like youre at a nice normal weight youre face isnt all angular and preying mantis like
5533779 all those years it has been such a wonderful place to live
5533780 the highest point in the house is 29 feet 6 inches and that meets height and setback requirements
5533781 i went the max according to what i was told and that was that we could only go 24 feet
5533782 a lot of people on the block built larger houses but they stayed at the same height as everyone else so that it doesnt stand out so much but this is a huge monster
5533783 since the stop work order was lifted they have been working like crazy
5533784 what is going to happen is they are going to build to a point where the city will say what the heck
5533785 well have purples and yellows and boldness and the before and after will be real striking
5533786 hes a well respected bowling entrepreneur that has a 50 plus year history in the industry
5533787 its nice to have something right here instead of having to go to the bodegas or use
5533788 its a nice store with high quality products but you pay for it
5533789 the microsoft relationship was key to us in a couple of ways notably that they made introductions for us that hooked us up with the microsoft visual studio team foundation server group since quite a few of our customers are using it being able to integrate our products seamlessly with visual studio is a big advantage for us and making introductions and recommendations to the vcs gave us a lot of credibility in the vc community and enabled us to raise money from several top tier firms weve now raised more than 15 million another 5 million was raised in january 2008
5533790 besides integration with microsoft visual studio we also integrate with microsoft office word and excel and our collaboration system is based on microsoft sharepoint services so were integrated with microsoft products across the board

5533793 it was clear last night that obamas criteria for selecting supreme court justices are fuzzy lack intellectual coherence and are subject to his own whims
5533794 for me this is a case about doing the right thing and being fair
5533795 not discriminating against people and doctors not playing the role of god saying because you are gay you are not worthy of having a child or a family i did it not only for me my partner and my children but for other people coming after me so they dont have to go through the humiliation and frustration and abandonment as a patient
5533796 so what happened was my best buddy in town called and said youve got to get back in the social life
5533797 wed say hey the copa looks good tonight but we wouldnt go because theyre charging double for guys and maybe we didnt have the cash
5533798 i tend to be attracted to black and latin chicks and asian chicks
5533799 what i think will happen is that clubs will reduce the price for guys and increase it for girls every guy will have ten or fifteen more dollars in his pocket which the girls will then manipulate into getting more drinks out of him if they drink more theyll have more fun and so will us guys and then when she wakes up in the morning shell be able to do what she always does blame the man

5533802 i hope i can avoid surgery but the way it is right now its pretty bad pretty sore and i cant play
5533803 if its surgery then im out eight weeks and im done for the season but until the doctor tells me im going to hope for the best
5533804 there are a lot of things i want to accomplish you prepare to play a full season and when its cut short thats disappointing
5533805 physically im tired three matches in a week its not easy with a return like that as well i hurt my adductors
5533806 the playing style is the best fit for the qualities of the players
5533807 this will not be just another friendly for our team because the dutch will be eager to settle the score so well have to be ready
5533808 yes were aware that all these buttons are pushed for you but you should really talk and think this through anyway and ask
5533809 in fact she went on to talk about faith and god which is again something that often makes me get my back up in soundbite terms but in a full length speech it was clear
5533810 should the government really be making the decision to force you to have a child
5533811 anything so complex and personal should be a matter of personal conscience
5533812 these fish are active at night its pitch black but they behave as if the lights were on
5533813 it is really hard to get these finicky fish to breed in the lab and also hard to separate out the pulses from more than one fish to tell whose discharges are from whom
5533814 was that there appears to be electrical duetting occurring between the sexes during courtship
5533815 since both male and female electric fish generate signals it is a natural for duetting

5533834 although these allegations do not involve official duties responsibilities or tasks as an associate justice these allegations are sufficient in attempt to establish rivera soto acted under color of law for purposes of an njcra claim
5533835 determine if rivera soto as plaintiff aptly put it tried to
5533836 at least the taxpayers wont be paying for his conduct
5533837 because the statute authorizes suits only against persons acting under color of law and the state is not defined as a person in the statute the claim falls
5533838 in this case the state did not owe a duty of care to plaintiff because it was not reasonably foreseeable rivera soto would allegedly engage in unlawful behavior directed at plaintiff
5533839 if government does not get in the way too much then there is no limit to your potential success
5533840 ill use the courts to challenge a sports ruling against me but government is bad and shouldnt get involved
5533841 ok so were almost 35 minutes into the arguments and theres not been a word said yet about the impact this case has on lgbt oregonians
5533842 even were bush v gore applicable to more than the one election to which the supreme court appears to have limited it oregons standard for verifying referendum signatures would be sufficiently uniform and specific to ensure equal treatment of voters the secretary of state uniformly instructs county elections officials to verify referendum signatures by determining whether each petition signature matches the signature on the signers voter registration card
5533843 this case was never necessarily about the signature verification process it was about overturning the domestic partnership law and that was a very real threat
5533844 oregon elections officials may process more than 100 000 sampled initiative and referendum signatures within the thirty day period required by state law in any election period there may be ten or more proposed initiative and referendum measures that require signature verification the administrative burden of verifying a referendum petition signature is significantly greater than the burden associated with verifying a vote by mail election ballot signature verification of a vote by mail signature takes mere seconds because elections officials can scan the barcode on the back of the ballot envelope and automatically access the signers voter registration record in contrast verification of each referendum petition signature takes several minutes because elections officials must identify the signer find the corresponding voter registration card determine whether the signer is an active registered voter and then compare the signatures moreover fraudulent signatures are less likely in vote by mail elections in which the ballots are sent directly by the elections official to the voter and returned directly by the voter to the elections official in initiative and referenda by contrast the signatures are often gathered by privately hired signature gatherers who are paid a fixed amount for each signature they obtain
5533845 there is no reason why a valid oregon elector whose name is selected as part of the statistical sample but whose name is wrongly thrown out should not have a right to a remedy
5533846 the state found a forensics expert who was willing to make that statement in court but that doesnt necessarily make it a true statement misha the simple fact of the matter is that 99 99 percent of the people who sign an initiative petition are who they say they are
5533847 there are only two kinds of stories in the world those about which i do not care to write as many as 600 words and those about which i would like to write many more than 600 words but there is nothing about which i would like to write exactly 600 words
5533848 i dont know that and again i dont think its appropriate to respond to matters that are pending before the court
5533849 cisco is gratified by the courts sanction orders we hope that king amp spalding will use the courts order as an opportunity to reflect upon their professionalism
5533850 failure to engage in a meaningful discussion with cisco ironport regarding these discovery issues
5533851 essentially called for every document at cisco ironport that deals with the accused products in this case which means in effect every document in the company
5533852 filled the record with invective in both challenging the motives of cisco ironport with respect to allegedly delaying discovery and challenging the honesty of cisco ironports counsel with respect to their representations to the court
5533853 mischaracterizing and misrepresenting the course of discovery and the communications between the parties
5533854 anything to avoid being held liable for the failure to meaningfully engage in discovery in this case
5533855 in light of this record the court finds that the above quoted statement from plaintiffs counsel is extremely disturbing
5533856 an adequate basis for provoking this enormously costly to the parties and enormously burdensome to the court discovery dispute and motions practice
5533857 this is a genuinely groundbreaking development that will transform the viability of civil cartel claims overnight
5533858 cartel key therefore makes access to justice a reality for individuals and businesses and firmly places the u k at the forefront of the emerging european collective redress framework

5533864 of course by all accounts the divorce was completely amicable after john and carol mccains divorce there was apparently some confusion about belongings that were roberta mccains but we understand the court papers were unintentionally filed and the matter never went further in the legal system it went nowhere and was of no consequence
5533865 had no knowledge of the suit he did not authorize the suit or participate in its filing
5533866 you can be sure that i talked to and got the permission of any client who is listed as a plaintiff
5533867 i dont think it took more than 15 minutes of his time
5533868 the fact that they dont remember it doesnt bother me
5533869 plaintiffs lawyers will routinely ask for significant damages to try and prompt a settlement

5533873 evidence reveals that the respondent without following the requisite protocol set forth in the regulations of the new york state department of mental hygiene
5533874 deed to execute while rubin was confined to a psychiatric ward in a delusional state of mind
5533875 rubins vulnerability was patent the respondent filed and recorded the deed despite being told that he could not obtain signatures on legal documents from patients in psychiatric wards without following accepted procedures
5533876 the gravamen of the within charge is that respondent acted in a manner which evinces dishonesty fraud deceit and misrepresentation and that his conduct adversely reflects on his fitness to practice law
5533877 mr clinton believed in good faith that rubin j had the legal capacity to execute the deed
5533878 it is clear that neither justice barasch nor this court made any finding which would establish any fraud deceit dishonesty misrepresentation or any hint of venality or even wrong doing on the part of respondent
5533879 the respondents defense is based on his own nonexpert diagnosis that rubin was of sound mind and was competent to cede ownership of his property without consideration and without the advice of an independent attorney the respondents counsel posits a subjective standard based on what was purportedly in the respondents mind at the time he had rubin j execute the deed notwithstanding the objective facts that standard was adopted by the special referee and factored prominently in his assessment of the witnesses credibility
5533880 the respondents position disregards the protection afforded by the new york state department of mental hygiene the advice of family members the rules of professional conduct and rulings by both the supreme court and the appellate division
5533881 are so overwhelming and irrefutable that no one would have the audacity to have made the allegations i made but for the circumstance of mistake or failure to recollect
5533882 great benefit to the bench and the bar because it clarified an important issue regarding the sharing of fees for partners who are retiring or contemplating retirement

5533890 with so many gen yers still living at home with mum and dad its not surprising they are less affected by an economic downturn in comparison to home owners and young families
5533891 the research found 31 are actually spending more on going out with a similar percentage 33 spending more on personal technology gadgets such as iphones wii fits and tom tom gps navigators and the cooking skills theyve been taught at home have well and truly gone to waste with 29 spending more on takeaways
5533892 overall were seeing the expected trend of people cutting back on going out
5533893 the key to winning in a slowing economy is to identify where spending increases are coming from

5533896 managing an appropriate balance between freedom and control is crucial to community growth and maintenance and must be tuned continuously
5533897 obviously given my background in financial services we are looking at ways you could use financial services with social networking
5533898 social networking is any network of people who have common interests so you could imagine a network of investors or network of investment professionals who want to share ideas using a social network
5533899 the interesting thing is you can get targeting and reach through a social network whereas you usually have to trade off one or the other you either have a lot of reach or not much targeting or you have got really good targeting or not much reach you actually have the best of both worlds

5533923 staff librarians share equally in library planning decision making and administration

5533940 they need to clear in their own mind on what the value proposition they are offering is but tesco showed there is no problem with brand and woolworths brand is relatively well known and perceived
5533941 there is no doubt there is room for retailers in financial services so expect to see more companies make the move in the future

5533948 psychiaters weten niets over het verstand ze behandelen het individu als niets meer dan een orgaan in het hoofd de hersenen en hebben ongeveer net zo veel interesse in spiritualiteit standaardgeneeskunde en genezen als een beul heeft in het redden van levens
5533949 als we geestelijke ziekten op dezelfde manier willen beschouwen als lichamelijke ziekten moet er een biochemisch of pathologisch bewijs voor zijn als een ziekte wetenschappelijk mee wil tellen moet het op de n of andere manier mogelijk zijn deze ziekte op wetenschappelijke wijze te benaderen te meten of te testen bijvoorbeeld door een bloedonderzoek of een elektroencefalogram meting van de elektrische activiteit in de hersenen als een ziekte niet op deze manier gemeten kan worden hetgeen het geval is met geestelijke ziekten dan is de term ziekte op zn best een metafoor en op zn slechtst een mythe en is het behandelen van deze ziekten dus feitelijk een onwetenschappelijke onderneming
5533950 een handgranaat in een schakelkast gooien om deze te repareren
5533951 het definitieve medische zegel op irrationeel gedrag plaatste door het te benoemen en te categoriseren irrationeel gedrag werd nu bespreekbaar in medisch gezelschap omdat het een naam had zijn classificatiesysteem domineert nog steeds de psychiatrie niet omdat het aangetoond heeft van waarde te zijn maar omdat het voor irrationeel gedrag het toegangskaartje tot de geneeskunde is geweest
5533952 deze pati nten liepen raar en hadden last van zenuwtrekkingen in hun gezicht spierspasmen en plotselinge slaapaanvallen hun pupillen reageerden traag op licht ze kwijlden hadden problemen met slikken voortdurende constipatie en waren niet in staat gewenste lichamelijke acties te voltooien
5533953 het diagnosticeren van iemand als schizofreen mag er aan de buitenkant wetenschappelijk uitzien helemaal als de biopsychiatrie blijft claimen dat er een genetische hersenziekte bij betrokken is maar als je even goed kijkt wat deze wetenschappers echt aan het doen zijn vraag je je verbaasd af hoe ze dit nog kunnen rechtvaardigen dit is geen wetenschap dit is simpelweg de wiskundige manipulatie van betekenisloze gegevens
5533954 schizofrenie te belangrijk voor de claim van de beroepsgroep op geneeskundig bestaansrecht de lichamelijke symptomen van de ziekte werden stilletjes weggemoffeld alleen de geestelijke symptomen bleven over als waarneembare verschijnselen hallucinaties waanbeelden en bizarre gedachten
5533955 dit vormen van de opinie speelde natuurlijk een belangrijke rol in het herpositioneren van neuroleptica als veilige anti schizofrenie medicijnen voor de geesteszieken
5533956 had 64 van de pati nten in de arme landen geen symptomen meer en functioneerde goed
5533957 psychiaters en hun instituten schuldig bevonden aan nalatigheid omdat ze pati nten niet gewaarschuwd hadden voor de risicos die verbonden waren aan de drugs de schadevergoeding in n van deze zaken bedroeg meer dan 3 miljoen
5533958 veel lijkt op wat we 25 jaar geleden zagen met tardive dyskinesia

5533968 hoewel pati nten misschien opgelucht zijn als hen verteld wordt dat ze een lichamelijke ziekte hebben ze hierdoor een passievere rol kunnen gaan aannemen bij hun eigen herstel en volledig afhankelijk worden van een lichamelijke behandeling om hun toestand te verbeteren
5533969 de belangrijkste functie en het belangrijkste doel van de dsm is het verlenen van geloofwaardigheid aan de bewering dat bepaald gedrag of beter gezegd wangedrag geestelijke stoornissen zijn en dat dergelijke stoornissen dus medische ziekten zijn hiermee krijgt het gokken dezelfde status als een hartinfarct bloedprop in de kransslagader
5533970 hoewel pati nten misschien opgelucht zijn als hen verteld wordt dat ze een lichamelijke ziekte hebben ze hierdoor wellicht een passievere rol aannemen bij hun eigen herstel en volledig afhankelijk worden van een lichamelijke behandeling om hun toestand te verbeteren
5533971 zelfs als zij het had geprobeerd zou de apa commissie geen overeenstemming hebben kunnen bereiken over wat deze stoornis inhoud zij kon slechts overeenstemming bereiken over de naam
5533972 men zou kunnen zeggen dat er geen slechtere term bestaat dan geestelijke stoornis om de condities die geclassificeerd worden in de dsm iv te beschrijven
5533973 schizofrenie is zo vaag gedefinieerd dat het feitelijk een term is die wordt toegepast op vrijwel elk soort gedrag waar de spreker het niet mee eens is
5533974 de etiologie leer der ziekteoorzaken en patho fysiologie functionele veranderingen van de bipolaire stoornis zijn nog niet vastgesteld er bestaan geen objectieve biologische indicatoren die beslist overeenkomen met de omstandigheid van deze ziekte
5533975 ten eerste is voor geen enkele psychiatrische stoornis een biologische etiologie oorzaak bewezen dus accepteer de mythe dat we een accurate diagnose kunnen stellen niet ook moet je niet geloven dat je problemen uitsluitend komen door een chemische onevenwichtigheid
5533976 de normale ups en downs van het leven in een ziekte te veranderen
5533977 de symptomen van depressie zijn subjectieve emotionele staten hetgeen de diagnose extreem vaag maakt
5533978 ontworpen zijn om precies te passen bij de werking van de drugs waarbij de lichamelijke symptomen die het meest reageren op de antidepressiva worden benadrukt het toekennen van een getal aan de depressie van een pati nt lijkt wellicht wetenschappelijk wanneer men echter de gestelde vragen en de gebruikte schalen bestudeert blijken het uiterst subjectieve metingen te zijn die gebaseerd worden op wat de pati nt vertelt of op de indrukken van een beoordelaar
5533979 er is een groeiende bezorgdheid binnen de klinische gemeenschap dat de neurowetenschappelijke ontwikkelingen niet alleen niets onthullen over de aard van psychiatrische stoornissen maar dat zij in feite de aandacht afleiden van klinisch onderzoek
5533980 als zou blijken dat schizofrenie een biochemische oorzaak heeft en er en geneeswijze voor bestaat dan zou schizofrenie niet langer een ziekte zijn waar een persoon gedwongen voor kan worden opgenomen de behandeling zou dan in handen komen te liggen van neurologen en psychiaters zouden er net zo weinig mee te maken hebben als met glioblastoma kwaadaardige tumor de ziekte van parkinson en andere hersenaandoeningen
5533981 niemand heeft ook maar het vaagste vermoeden van de chemische effecten van psychotrope drugs op levende menselijke hersenen
5533982 meer en meer problemen zijn opnieuw gedefinieerd als stoornissen of ziekten zogenaamd veroorzaakt door genetische vatbaarheid en biochemische onevenwichtigheden gebeurtenissen in het leven worden gedegradeerd tot de lont van de onderliggende biologische tijdbom je heel verdrietig voelen is een depressieve stoornis geworden je te veel zorgen maken is een ongerustheidstoornis het maken van lijsten van gedrag het plakken van medisch klinkende etiketten op mensen die dergelijke gedrag vertonen om vervolgens de aanwezigheid van dit gedrag te gebruiken om te bewijzen dat ze de ziekte hebben is wetenschappelijk betekenisloos
5533983 er zijn geen testen om de chemische toestand van de hersenen van een levende persoon vast te stellen
5533984 zijn er geen biochemische anatomische of functionele indicatoren gevonden die een betrouwbaar onderscheid kunnen maken tussen de hersenen van diverse psychiatrische pati nten
5533985 we weten dat het model van de chemische onevenwichtigheid voor geestelijke ziekten nooit wetenschappelijk is bewezen we weten ook dat al het redelijke bewijs daarentegen wijst naar de schadelijke effecten van psychiatrische drugs bovendien weten we ook dat het onderzoek naar de effectiviteit of uitwerking van middelen onbetrouwbaar is omdat deze onderzoeken alleen de reductie van symptomen meten geen genezing
5533986 er bestaat geen bloedonderzoek of andere biologische test om de aanwezigheid of afwezigheid van een geestelijke ziekte vast te stellen zoals die er voor de meeste lichamelijke ziektenwel zijn als zon test ontwikkeld zou worden voor wat tot dan toe als psychiatrische ziekte werd beschouwd zou de conditie niet langer een geestelijke ziekte zijn maar zou ze in plaats daarvan als een symptoom van een lichamelijke ziekte worden geclassificeerd
5533987 ten eerste is voor geen enkele psychiatrische stoornis een biologische etiologie oorzaak bewezen
5533988 veel doktoren waarschuwen voor het gebruik van de spect single photon emission
5533989 er is geen wetenschappelijke basis voor deze beweringen het gebruiken van hersenscans voor psychiatrische diagnoses de pati nten moet in ieder geval verteld worden dat spect heel controversieel is
5533990 een nauwkeurige diagnose gebaseerd op een scan is eenvoudigweg niet mogelijk
5533991 n iet n ervan is bewezen integendeel elke keer als men dacht zon onevenwichtigheid te hebben gevonden werd later bewezen dat dit niet waar was
5533992 er wordt aan deze theorie n vastgehouden niet alleen omdat er niets anders is maar ook omdat ze erg bruikbaar zijn bij het promoten van behandelingen met psychiatrische drugs
5533993 psychiaters doen onbewezen beweringen dat depressies bipolaire stoornissen onrust alcoholisme en een groot aantal andere stoornissen in de eerste plaats biologisch en misschien zelfs genetisch van oorsprong zijn dit soort geloof in wetenschappelijke vooruitgang is schrikbarend om niet te zeggen na ef en vermoedelijk een waanbeeld
5533994 er zijn geen testen beschikbaar om de chemische status van de hersenen van een levend persoon vast te stellen
5533995 some question value of brain scan untested tool belongs in lab only experts say
5533996 medewerkers in de geestelijke gezondheidszorg hebben een professionele en wettelijke plicht om de aanwezigheid van lichamelijke ziekten te herkennen bij hun pati nten lichamelijke ziekten kunnen geestelijke stoornissen veroorzaken of verergeren
5533997 de tijdelijke psychose veroorzaakt door het gebruik van amfetamineachtige drugs
5533998 vaak niet te onderscheiden is van een acute of parano de schizofrenie
5533999 symptomen als gevolg van een tekort aan vitamine b12 vari ren van slechte concentratie tot apathische depressie ernstige gejaagdheid en hallucinaties er is bewezen dat bepaalde voedingsstoffen neurotische en psychotische reacties onmiddellijk kunnen stoppen
5534000 d enk er alsjeblieft aan dat de meerderheid van de mensen aan een organische ziekte lijdt clinici moeten er als eerste aan denken dat emotionele stress die verband houdt met een chronische ziekte het temperament van de pati nt kan veranderen
5534001 bovenaan mijn verlanglijst staat de simpele smeekbede voor eerlijkheid houd op met het aan mensen met schizofrenie vertellen dat ze lijden aan een dopamine overschot of aan een teveel aan serotonine vertel ze niet dat de voorgeschreven psychiatrische drugs deze chemicali n in de hersenen weer in evenwicht brengen dat hele verhaal is een vorm van medische fraude en het is onmogelijk je voor te stellen dat een andere groep pati nten laten we zeggen die kanker of hart en vaatziekten hebben op dezelfde manier wordt bedrogen
5534002 ik opende soteria house in 1971 er woonden jonge mensen die de diagnose schizofreen hadden gekregen zonder het gebruik van psychiatrische drugs en met niet professionele personeelsleden deze personeelsleden waren getraind om te luisteren om hen te begrijpen en hen steun veiligheid en bevestiging voor hun ervaringen te bieden het idee was dat schizofrenie dikwijls kan worden verholpen met hulp van zinvolle relaties in plaats van met psychiatrische middelen
5534003 het experiment werkte beter dan verwacht twee jaar na de opname werkten pati nten die in soteria waren behandeld in duidelijk hogere maatschappelijke posities leefden beduidend vaker zelfstandig of met groepsgenoten en hadden minder last van terugval het is interessant om te zien dat cli nten die werden behandeld in soteria zonder neuroleptische middelen en van wie gedacht werd dat zij de slechtste resultaten zouden halen het in werkelijkheid het beste deden in vergelijking met de mensen van de onderzoeksgroep die werden opgenomen en die met psychiatrische drugs werden behandeld

5534006 i was shocked to see he is not supportive of this
5534007 i thought him being an advocate on health and everything i thought this would have been a natural thing for him to support for him to not even give it the opportunity have a broader discussion is very puzzling to me
5534008 this is clearly not a a high priority for the people of san jose we just want through a six month community based budget process setting priorities and making decisions about how we spend time and money and this never came up
5534009 i think we have a lot of serious issues facing san jose right now
5534010 this is something that is going to take away from the real work that needs to be done
5534011 a lot of them have put in a lot of time in past years or in the summer or in the spring some are seniors so they have put in four years so it is very important to them
5534012 it is just so devastating when you lose a player that is so close to you but now a days coaches will air on the caution side
5534013 in our trainings when we train coaches and when we have our coaches workshops we have specific sessions on hydration and things of that nature
5534014 somewhat surprising to us that ea agreed to change its offer from hostile to friendly
5534015 results for the year 2007 08 were not as healthy as expected
5534016 this has been attributed to early difficulties in securing the services of a long term manager
5534017 time lags between adoption and implementation of some systems reduced the effectiveness of the strategies employed by leisure co in the area of income generation has also had an impact
5534018 the problem with that is they probably learned to drive in a different era and arent as up to date on road rules and safety as they might think
5534019 we found that when we tried to get parents to sit the test they failed because they learned how to drive 30 years ago
5534020 the program incorporates a three pronged approach of awareness education and enforcement
5534021 as part of the education phase we will be visiting schools and discussing driver behaviour as well as helping ensure parents know the road rules well enough to teach their children
5534022 the extra five or six years difference in buying these cars could save your childs life
5534023 these older cars are less survivable they have old technology and theyre given to a driver who is inexperienced
5534024 people who didnt attend spoke to those who had and said they wish they had gone
5534025 we do live in a relatively safe area but we do need to consider these situations
5534026 we are setting strategic goals and objectives for the plaza and strategies to achieve those within a reasonable timeframe
5534027 the three main categories we are addressing include the precinct positioning and marketing of the precinct and partnerships both internal and external
5534028 undertaking this process will give the association more credibility especially when dealing with organisations such as whyalla city council whyalla economic development board and the chamber of commerce amongst others
5534029 a great start has been made a strategic plan will enable the city plaza traders association to move forward with clearer objectives and pathways to meet those objectives in an achievable and time realistic manner
5534030 its a good show because everyone is really unique theres country r amp b pop rock you know soulful michael johns its neat its a fun show
5534031 biggest foundations are the ones that are the most likely to increase which could be good or bad the report also found that a strong growth in foundation assets along with the establishment of new foundations was the reason for the increase
5534032 in 2007 the arizona senator reported 405 409 in total income and contributed 105 467 or 26 percent of his total income to charity
5534033 its frustrating not to be able to respond immediately and provide on the ground assistance
5534034 they jumped on it really fast sometimes conditions just combine to make it difficult to catch

5534064 i was heartbroken when this happened hes such a wonderful dog
5534065 he loves coming to work and didnt want to give up
5534066 he came up and jumped on me i knew right then i wanted to make it work with this dog
5534067 hed bang things and scream when rockys head was turned he couldnt focus on anything
5534068 when a dog loses a sense they can become aggressive we didnt know how he would react and couldnt take the chance hed attack without command
5534069 well have a team all geared up ready to quell a fight we bring the k 9s in and it all stops they save us so many problems
5534070 i cant thank them enough for not getting rid of him hes a great dog and a great asset to the prison
5534071 is scambaiting a clever way to combat corrupt actors preying on desperate and foolish people or do some of the more derogatory baits say something about our darker selves laying bare the divide between white and black rich and poor first world and third
5534072 ida corr vs fedde le grand let me think about it
5534073 profiting from the public domain just got a whole lot easier
5534074 at that time jesus came from nazareth in galilee and was baptized by john in the jordan
5534075 at the time jesus came from nazareth in galilee and was dipped by john in the jordan
5534076 we were buried with him through baptism into death in order that just as christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the father we too may live a new life
5534077 well we can do that we can have a vote on that

5534080 baley met some older girl scouts earlier this year and heard about some of their past projects
5534081 she asked me what she could do to help us at the department and we found out the dogs needed some cooling vests
5534082 they really got into the recycling and i am tired of seeing the cans
5534083 when she found out that she raised enough money for the equipment she had a huge smile on her face she has been like a beam of light walking around i am very proud of her
5534084 she wants to now raise money and recycle more cans to purchase a k 9 officer for a local law enforcement agency in need
5534085 she thinks she can do just about anything now and i think it is great she really wants to help and those dogs are a great tool to help fight crime
5534086 shawn was a part of our football family and weve lost a member of our family
5534087 our thoughts and our prayers go out to his wife jenny and all of his family and her family for their loss
5534088 we also brought in some members of the local clergy and some staff counselors for anybody who needed them
5534089 a lot of our older players were very close friends with shawn while most of our younger players hardly knew him
5534090 im not sure just what direction we are going right now
5534091 right now we want to take care of our coaches spend some time with jenn and try and get through today
5534092 he was kind of the man behind the scenes guy for us
5534093 he was always around and always with good things to say he took an interest in our football team
5534094 he was part of the day to day operations here that made our job so much easier

5534100 jika ide tentang rakyat adalah ide tentang pasar dan pemilihan umum jadi toko kelontong besar demokrasi akan memilih seorang arnold schwarzenegger
5534101 if you ask people in places like wisconsin and minnesota what are some of the things that are most concerning to you and most important to you in the election this fall one of the things that comes immediately to mind is the economy and energy prices
5534102 i think this is going to be a very large and important issue for wisconsin voters
5534103 if they believe mccain has the right ideas on energy policy it hurts obama
5534104 you can feel the race tightening up and this is one of the issues that has done it for mccain
5534105 the bigger issue when it comes to voting is whether people feel secure about the future and generally the answer is no and that generally bodes well for the democrats
5534106 if you are not gay a man should not be wearing pink
5534107 its the sort of stuff that gets said every day in the schoolyard
5534108 a lot of young people are quite impressionable and when they see celebrities saying stuff like that they think its ok to say it themselves
5534109 if you are not gay a man should not be wearing pink
5534110 thats what it is we were just shaking this morning and couldnt believe it was possibly true
5534111 we just got home from the hospital and really its not sunk in
5534112 until we were handed the check it wasnt real to us
5534113 it was a long planned out thing to just keep doing it over and over it was a thought out process
5534114 i dont recall a time when weve had members of the same household win in the same drawing like that
5534115 we would certainly expect that it be a very nice looking facility
5534116 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5534117 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5534118 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5534119 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5534120 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5534121 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5534122 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5534123 that has me thinking about of all things how tom searls was 10 times the journalist russert was
5534124 there was a time in america when the press and the government were on opposite sides of the field the press was supposed to speak on behalf of the people the new tradition is that the press speaks on behalf of the government
5534125 tim russert was a spokesman for power wealth and privilege thats why 1 000 people came to his memorial service because essentially he was a shill for the government it didnt matter whether it was democratic or republican it was for the status quo
5534126 when interviewing powerful people and thats because at the end of the day russert deeply truly like these politicians he interviewed and he was desperately afraid of upsetting any one of them
5534127 he respected politicians he knew that they got blamed for everything got credit for nothing he knew how much they meant he never treated them with the cynicism that attends some of these interviews so they had a place to be loved
5534128 he never lost certain southern west virginia traits one of which was a healthy suspicion of the motives of out of staters
5534129 all his bluster distortions and negative attacks notwithstanding it is hard to understand how senator mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country the difference in this race is that john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5534130 oh yea hes very well endowed no that one was saturday yesterday was the third one i sent the attachment called e me or something yea theyre all ok oh you know the one called aw i dont know the one with the mole on his sack you know who he reminds me of my fiancee seriously looks just like his no i sent those to you cuz i dont know if theyre still on craigslist but i wanted you to have your pick too seriously you should get one of those guys to get back at rog itd do wonders yea i mean look at them oh you know what you should do get one of them to get your f on with right before rog comes home seriously rogll probably beat the sh out of him then come back to you man trust me the guy wont say sh oh please the guys on casuals are less than sh its bad enough theyll f anybody but to advertise it dont worry about that just take your pick they dont matter anyway if theyre on there in the first place so they wont say anything if they do get the sh beaten out of them but seriously take a look at the one with the mole does that totally look like my fiancee or what you remember ow ok i gotta go soon my ear is getting bit nah this is another one say hi to my friend a butthead like guffaw was emitted yea man im still stuck in portland cuz i missed the damn connection so now i have to stay here for another few days
5534131 i was heartbroken when this happened hes such a wonderful dog
5534132 he loves coming to work and didnt want to give up
5534133 he came up and jumped on me i knew right then i wanted to make it work with this dog
5534134 hed bang things and scream when rockys head was turned he couldnt focus on anything

5534171 la relajaci n de la costumbre de usar el preservativo puede venir motivada por la creencia de que el riesgo de transmisi n de las ets es menor porque ya no se habla tanto de ellas

5534398 commodore bainimarama at the pacific island leaders forum in tonga in october last year gave a faithful and unconditional undertaking to have an election in fiji before the end of march next year mr smith told sky news
5534399 he was compelled as a matter of honour to turn up to the forum and explain himself to the leaders
5534400 it is very disappointing that he wont turn up to effectively take his medicine
5534401 so its very disappointing and i think the leaders in niue including our own prime minister will understandably be very gravely disappointed at the refusal of commodore bainimarama to turn up
5534402 australia needs to argue strongly both regionally in the pacific and in the international community that fiji must return to democracy must return to respecting human rights and the rule of law and democratic processes in fiji

5534414 the fbi needs to explain why it zeroed in on ivins how he could have made the anthrax mailed to lawmakers and the media and how he or anyone else could have pulled off the attacks acting alone
5534415 obviously looking at it in hindsight we would do things differently today
5534416 were we perfect absolutely not weve had missteps those are the lessons learned

5534476 thats what the olympics is about giving people chills when they watch us play we cant do anything but be good representatives for softball and good ambassadors for our team and country
5534477 sometimes we think are these kinds of victories a positive thing
5534478 we are competitive we are here to win unfortunately we have to think about what other people think
5534479 i think the game just needs more time to grow weve only been in the olympics since 1996 and the growth since then has been unbelievable i just hope we can get back in
5534480 back softball initiative which hopes to generate enough support for the sport to be readmitted to the olympics when the ioc determines the london sports program in october 2009
5534481 were trying to get a second breath and we arent going to give up

5534532 dudaba de que una historia sobre el aburrimiento no fuera aburrida
5534533 for all we know there is a gay rower or badminton player somewhere known as gay within his or her sport but not in a larger public context
5534534 its everybody else who thinks its special when homosexuality and elite sport go together
5534535 the vast majority of olympic athletes are under 30 a time when even people who are not elite jocks are wrestling with their sexuality
5534536 being an olympic athlete requires full time dedication and a lot of things get put on hold it is just easier to hide and deal with ones sexuality later
5534537 kyle is really good on restarts and i wasnt going to let him get the kind of run on me that he got on jimmie johnson a few weeks ago
5534538 so i just didnt want to have to go through the pain i did everything i could to have the best restart i could and it worked out great
5534539 he has been all year hes the guy that weve got to race on these mile and a half two mile racetracks hes been decent at the other race tracks too but not as stout as he is at these and theres a lot of those in the chase
5534540 those are racetracks that i feel like we need to gain on i dont feel like we struggled there in the first part of the year
5534541 but we need to get better at qualifying up front at those tracks so we dont have to fight for track position all day so we can just run our own race and try to keep up in the top five top 10 if we can get better at passing guys at those tracks thatll make it easier
5534542 we didnt qualify well obviously starting 27th makes it a little tense early in the race but carl did a great job with the car coming through the field
5534543 we were pretty loose there and the 18 was able to stretch a pretty big lead from laps 142 to 165 having the ability to pit again and work on the car when the debris caution was called on lap 166 was a relief carl did a great job from there on out
5534544 were getting to the point that we can win at any race track we go to
5534545 our pit crew has stepped up their game that was our weakness for a long time the guys have repeatedly worked harder week after week to become better so yea i feel confident at all the race tracks we go to
5534546 my psyche and mentality is pretty much fixed on im the greatest race car driver that ever lived know what im saying david pearson told me that if you dont believe that you dont belong in a race car
5534547 it definitely wouldve been great to win but you dont want to take an unnecessary risk and take out a top five finish or finish 20th
5534548 the 18 and the 99 were just a little better than us and after we didnt pit for tires that last run we were going to be sitting ducks depending on how the cautions worked out
5534549 i just drove as hard as i could and tried not to make any mistakes at this point in the season a third place is great a win wouldve been better but a 20th place finish would have been devastating for us trying to make the chase
5534550 we made stupid choices dash malfunctions motor problems at this point we dont deserve to be in the chase
5534551 the flood of chinese imports that are blamed by many americans for destroying american jobs and could prove politically embarrassing
5534552 i am a muslim myself and i dont think that my being a muslim has got anything to do with my brother being the president of the united states
5534553 apoyar a pi era antes de las municipales ser a rid culo apoyarlo despu s de la municipal igual de rid culo por lo tanto hay que verlo el pr ximo a o
5534554 apoyar ahora a pi era ser a el peor escenario porque no tiene ning n valor hacerlo hoy d a desde el punto de vista pol tico me parece una torpeza
5534555 el compromiso de la udi con los m s pobres
5534556 si finalmente se da el respaldo de la udi a pi era va a ser un hecho pol tico importante y hay que saber cuando se hace y hay que saber en qu condiciones se hace hay que saber qu gobierno vamos a hacer
5534557 hay que administrarle esta histeria a la derecha lo peor es actuar en funci n de la histeria colectiva que se genera en el mundo nuestro es una histeria permanente
5534558 my firm view is that so often all of us including our kids are defined by socio economic boundaries but when you go to outer space none of that exists so lets inspire kids to be astronauts not just a basketball player or a rap star which are fine but its not the only thing out there
5534559 but it is the experience that blows people away you cant really explain it you have to experience this movie the new 3 d technology is the most immersive wonderful feeling you are the proverbial fly on the wall its all part of what makes fly me to the moon so special
5534560 its very skewed for kids today as to what a hero is for my kids its a basketball player a baseball player a rap star when i was growing up it was an astronaut a scientist a doctor a veterinarian etc that just doesnt seem to happen anymore every kid wants to be famous thats why i am so proud of this movie because it is very inspirational and you hope that one child will see it and maybe think hey i want to be an astronaut or just something that makes kids think that they can do something out there to better the world rather than just be famous
5534561 we were in a meeting pitching some of domonics work and it was at the tail end of the meeting that i said we do have one more project its called fly me to the moon mimi looked over at me in shock wondering what i had just said i quickly told them is was about 3 flies who stow away on the apollo 11 in 1969 and they said well wed really love to see that do you have something and i said yes as a matter of fact we do when in reality we had nothing other than a one page synopsi
5534562 the studio asked us how soon we could get something to them and we said right away
5534563 but with his other projects he had to write this in between everything else the way it turned out was that we were literally running pages over to the studio on a daily basis it was like some keystone comedy it was hilarious
5534564 were excited that were the pioneers of a new film technology
5534565 sometimes theres so much beauty in the world i feel like i cant take it
5534566 raw milk is raw milk whether it is sold or bartered or given away
5534567 well let him ride ponies hes got lifts in his shoes
5534568 when i give him a hug hes always in my armpit so ive got to make sure ive got deodorant on
5534569 deepak said he was going to get even i told him have at it i told him not to hurt anybody but it should be funny adit didnt want a party it was my ambition to have a party dont write anything we are simple people i just need everybodys blessings
5534570 sven sundgaard is not coming to wcco to my knowledge and i think id know i think he does fine work but nope hes not coming to work here unless somebody out there hired him without my knowledge that would be news
5534571 i pretty much knew that this was going to be the case when i left here thursday night
5534572 it didnt feel good and that was different from my rehab starts
5534573 i could try and get through the rest of the year if we were in a pennant race
5534574 then yeah maybe your approach is different based on conversations ive had with the doctors and how ive pitched the last two times with it clearly im not doing us any good
5534575 the hard part about what i was doing before was that i was just sitting around and getting treatment when theres no guarantee its going to work
5534576 developing our oil sands has had its environmental challenges but weve come a long way
5534577 we will also be introducing tough new regulations that will require even more dramatic cuts
5534578 we tried the inside approach to bringing about change and the government has said yup we hear what youre saying and we agree that these are the problems and yet they havent been willing to step up
5534579 we feel weve exhausted the possibility of working within cema to bring about changes
5534580 i dont think what pembina is saying is that cema does bad scientific work
5534581 i think pembinas frustration and the frustration of the first nations and the frustration of a lot of members is the politics that when things come out it seems to take a long time to see a result
5534582 the whole issue of north american energy security coupled with responsible environmental stewardship are the flip sides of the same issue
5534583 the oil sands are critical to north american energy security and its important that we explain not only to the americans but internationally the responsible way in which those developments are going to unfold
5534584 take nothing away and least of all should fool people out of something as if it were nothing
5534585 to fool people out of something as if it were nothing
5534586 objections against christianity come from insubordination unwillingness to obey rebellion against all authority
5534587 the misfortune of our age in the political as well as in the religious sphere and in all things is disobedience unwillingness to obey and one deceives oneself and others by wishing to make us imagine that it is doubt no it is insubordination
5534588 the attitude of those who willingly suffer everything for their unquestioned faith and who obediently commit atrocities for it too
5534589 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5534590 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5534591 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5534592 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5534593 this is what i have pelase make sure it will fit
5534594 ive lived lots of places but ive always said this place has the most beautiful skies
5534595 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
5534596 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto

5534600 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5534601 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
5534602 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
5534603 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii

5534611 this is deep music this is fun music something is happening here i dont know what or who the ear reverends sound like but i know i like it
5534612 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5534613 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5534614 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5534615 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5534616 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5534617 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5534618 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5534619 thousands of young people on princes trust schemes support their community every year with many actively volunteering to help older age groups
5534620 negative ageist stereotypes often disappear when different generations come together and learn to understand and appreciate each other
5534621 breaking down barriers in this way undoubtedly lays the ground for building stronger communities
5534622 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5534623 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5534624 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5534625 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5534626 itll be one of the slowest days of the year and i think it just kind of fed into itself
5534627 the degree and depth of whats happening in the financial industry is beyond anything weve seen in decades and it takes time to get your arms around the severity of whats happening and what the long term and short term ramifications are
5534628 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5534629 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5534630 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5534631 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5534632 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5534633 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5534634 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5534635 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5534636 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5534637 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5534638 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5534639 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5534640 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5534641 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5534642 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5534643 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5534644 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5534645 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5534646 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
5534647 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
5534648 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
5534649 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
5534650 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
5534651 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
5534652 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5534653 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5534654 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5534655 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5534656 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5534657 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5534658 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5534659 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5534660 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5534661 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
5534662 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
5534663 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5534664 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5534665 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5534666 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5534667 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5534668 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5534669 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5534670 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5534671 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5534672 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5534673 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
5534674 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
5534675 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
5534676 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as
5534677 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto
5534678 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
5534679 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
5534680 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5534681 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
5534682 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
5534683 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
5534684 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
5534685 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
5534686 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
5534687 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
5534688 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
5534689 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
5534690 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
5534691 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
5534692 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
5534693 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5534694 weve got to play a whole game in the regular season unfortunately
5534695 well god didnt know or understand what the invention of tobacco would later cause
5534696 i believe that new orleans had a level of sin that was offensive to god and they are were recipients of the judgment of god for that
5534697 this may partly reflect opinions of christians in the samples who take biblical sanctions against many paranormal activities seriously
5534698 my guess is that religiosity has a lot to do with how you were raised and less to do with genetics
5534699 those people who may have a high genetic susceptibility to faith based knowledge may end up being highly religious or may end up having belief in the paranormal depending on how they were raised those people less susceptible to that method of forming beliefs may still end up being highly religious if they were raised in a religious family
5534700 among christians those who attend church very often and are exposed to stigma and sacrifice within their congregations are least likely to believe in the paranormal
5534701 conversely those christians who do not attend church very often maybe once or twice a year are the most likely to hold paranormal beliefs
5534702 are much less likely to consult horoscopes visit psychics purchase new age items
5534703 however among those christians who do not attend church there is a much higher level of participation in these phenomena
5534704 perhaps amazingly paranormal beliefs are not related at all to education
5534705 ph d s are as likely as high school dropouts to believe in bigfoot loch ness monster ghosts etc
5534706 creatures such as bigfoot and the loch ness monster will one day be discovered by science
5534707 i mean its very important to stewart haas racing obviously
5534708 the flood of personnel that have come over and wanted to join the team since we made that announcement has been huge with the addition of ryan coming on board now i think its even going to make that list even grow larger
5534709 you know to have tony come on board obviously and now ryan its just unbelievable tonys led the charge the programs growing its exciting to be part of it
5534710 i think a lot of tony from a personal standpoint as well as a driving standpoint and ive seen his success from an ownership standpoint with the usac cars and the world of outlaws cars ive seen him get the job done in other venues and i look forward to the opportunity
5534711 hopefully in the next couple weeks well have something locked down on that side
5534712 i told tony the bottom line is im here to have fun i want to have fun with you i know he wants to have fun doing this
5534713 thats what racing hasnt been a whole lot of for me lately due to the fact we had success in 02 03 part of 04 and since then it hasnt been as successful therefore some of the fun is gone with that i look forward to having fun again
5534714 i had a lot of discussions with a lot of other organizations the last little bit
5534715 i mean i couldnt tell you a day that i decided and all that stuff
5534716 the thing that impressed me the most about ryan was that he asked all the right questions
5534717 weve still never spoke about a dollar in the contract the questions he asked me about were how are we going to win races how are we going to win championships how are we going to get the right people in place to do the right jobs
5534718 it was first and foremost about how he was going to run and how we were going to ensure that we were going to get him quality cars equipment people to surround him to give him that opportunity
5534719 por q crees q este se or se qued solo
5534720 seg n la lectura juan viv a en un rbol o en una ciudad

5534722 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5534723 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5534724 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5534725 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5534726 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5534727 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5534728 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5534729 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5534730 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5534731 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5534732 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5534733 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5534734 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5534735 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5534736 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5534737 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5534738 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
5534739 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5534740 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5534741 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5534742 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5534743 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5534744 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5534745 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5534746 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5534747 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5534748 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5534749 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5534750 just gotten up to speed within the past year or so
5534751 if you knew you were taking a turn you could pause the video and line it up its as simple as that
5534752 it was very painful the fact that you have someone telling you they will not help you because of who you are that they will deny your right to be a mother and have a family
5534753 it was clear and emphatic that discrimination has no place in doctors offices
5534754 the supreme courts desire to promote the homosexual lifestyle at the risk of infringing upon the first amendment right to free exercise of religion is what the public needs to learn about
5534755 this case will have a direct impact and cause people and look very favorably at proposition 8
5534756 frankly i feel that parents who dont vaccinate their children are parasites
5534757 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
5534758 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
5534759 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
5534760 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
5534761 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5534762 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
5534763 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
5534764 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
5534765 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
5534766 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
5534767 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
5534768 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
5534769 our philosophy at testology is that thorough creative gameplay and qa testing is a vital part of the games development process tiga has established itself as an essential organisation which works tirelessly for the benefit of the games development industry so it made sense for testology to join tiga
5534770 being part of tiga will hopefully help testology to share its experience with other members i can see a great many benefits in joining tiga and were looking forward to the year ahead
5534771 testologys decision to join tiga is good for testology good for tiga and good for the membership testology brings considerable experience to the industry and strengthens our network of businesses im delighted to welcome testology on board
5534772 o papel de salma era muito pequeno e teve que ser cortado

5534775 la muerte est tan segura de su victoria que nos da toda una vida de ventaja
5534776 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5534777 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5534778 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5534779 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5534780 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5534781 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5534782 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5534783 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5534784 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5534785 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5534786 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5534787 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5534788 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5534789 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5534790 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5534791 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5534792 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5534793 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5534794 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5534795 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5534796 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5534797 theres two shuttles one to the top and one to the hospital
5534798 a new generation seems to have grown up one that doesnt understand high technology even though it uses it
5534799 por que dicen q los hombres inventamos a dios y q escribimos la biblia nosotros mismos cuando la biblia fue inspirada por dios escrita a trav s de 44 personas a lo largo de 1500 a os sin contradicciones y con profec as cumplidas
5534800 what weve learned is that pollution is very labor intensive
5534801 its all well and good to say you want to cover a planets surface with discarded aluminum cans but someone has to put them there worse still someone has to make them someone has to mine the raw materials
5534802 this one may have been the first earth like planet weve found but it certainly wont be the last
5534803 it is incumbent upon the scientific community to find a way to make them all uninhabitable as soon as possible these new planets arent going to ruin themselves you know
5534804 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5534805 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5534806 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5534807 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5534808 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5534809 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5534810 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5534811 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5534812 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5534813 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
5534814 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
5534815 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
5534816 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
5534817 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
5534818 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5534819 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5534820 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5534821 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5534822 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
5534823 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
5534824 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5534825 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5534826 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5534827 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5534828 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5534829 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5534830 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5534831 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5534832 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5534833 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5534834 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5534835 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5534836 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5534837 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5534838 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5534839 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5534840 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5534841 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5534842 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5534843 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5534844 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5534845 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5534846 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5534847 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5534848 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5534849 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5534850 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5534851 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5534852 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5534853 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5534854 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5534855 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5534856 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5534857 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5534858 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5534859 this is a planning took where all things are going
5534860 why would you spend this much money to get an inch lopped off your basic short cut
5534861 we will honor our contracts with both hotels and we have exercised our option to hold all aals events at the marriott to ensure the maximum participation by our members
5534862 children are like mirrors to us reflecting back the very things we hate about ourselves imagine if you felt proud strong and in control so would your children they will do what you do not necessarily what you say they learn through imitation so if you dont like the way your children are behaving look at yourself for that is where the answers often lie
5534863 mas ternyata buku ini cd nya tidak ada mas pilih tuker dengan buku lainnya seharga buku ini atau mas mau nunggu beberapa sampai kami menghubungi penerbit dan meminta cd nya

5534868 i dont have any experience with botswana students in this manner and havent heard of any my classes have a lot of african students but had no such experience they submit their assignments and do their presentations on time god has been good and has given me good students so far i cannot generalise any group in this way there are many hardworking students among the botswanians
5534869 a reply from a reader on topic beware of local universitys african students
5534870 chicken shit for the soul women are smarter than men
5534871 i couldnt believe my eyes when i found out on sunday through the psd website that my application was unsuccessful
5534872 i just want to become a doctor so i can serve the country
5534873 the psd should have taken the top scorers result from the malaysian examination syndicate and offer scholarships to the students it is up to the students whether to accept or reject the scholarships
5534874 malaysia education a fail based policy girl with 10a1s shocked by psds rejection
5534875 i dont consider myself bald im just taller than my hair
5534876 i was worried that they had given my son the wrong prescription
5534877 but when i asked they the hospital staff rudely replied that the medication was based on the doctors slip
5534878 the doctor was shocked with the amount of antibiotics prescribed for my son which he said was also too much for an adult
5534879 interest in advance of advertising has been very robust for both businesses
5534880 the work necessary to restructure these businesses to enable them to generate strong cashflows was largely completed by management and we expect to consummate sales of the respective businesses over the next 10 to 12 weeks
5534881 also on monday crist said he supported amendment two which would constitutionally ban gay marriage in the
5534882 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5534883 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5534884 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5534885 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5534886 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5534887 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5534888 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5534889 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5534890 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5534891 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5534892 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5534893 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5534894 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5534895 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5534896 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5534897 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5534898 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5534899 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5534900 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5534901 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5534902 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5534903 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5534904 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5534905 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5534906 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5534907 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5534908 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5534909 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5534910 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5534911 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5534912 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5534913 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5534914 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5534915 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5534916 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5534917 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5534918 that was the law before the initiative and its nothing new i dont know why wed relax any law
5534919 were concerned during the democratic national convention that they are going to use the law to cite people or detain them
5534920 the ordinance says lowest priority it doesnt say stop prosecuting im not concerned police will get carried away i want police to focus on whats important and i expect they will
5534921 is content to rely on the failed policies of president bush

5534925 the sunday times report is the reason for the fall but its slightly overdone
5534926 rightmove has 15 million hits per month from househunters with 80 85 percent of all property pageviews any newcomer has to spend a lot of money on marketing money which they dont have anyway to build critical mass
5534927 at the end of the day rightmove is an unnatural monopoly and they will carry on even benefit though not until house prices recover
5534928 i will be supporting the removal of abortion from the crimes act i think thats the right thing its the right thing in terms of public policy mr brumby said
5534929 but i would stress that the proposal we are putting to the parliament is one that would be consistent and fully consistent with current clinical practice
5534930 for women i think its a crucial matter for them that a personal decision theyve made about themselves and their body is subject to action under the criminal code
5534931 removing this from the criminal code is important for women it is something that many women and many womens organisations have fought long and hard for so i think its important
5534932 besides being the greatest pop star of the century michael jackson is an advocate for diversity and the rights of children i welcome his warmth and his strength to my ticket of hope and change
5534933 im believe so much in baracks movement for hope and change that i have agreed to leave my special young friends in the care of a nanny and venture out on the campaign trail i have always said that i can learn everything i want from a young boy and i promise to bring that philosophy to the campaign and to the office of vice president barry and i call our joint program the peter pan platform and my job is to be tinker bell
5534934 i know the site looks like crap its because of
5534935 the indianapolis airport authority board of directors determined the name should more clearly reflect the identity of our city and the capital of our state that name remains in place today for the same reason
5534936 you see that colin has been transformed by the magic inside the garden
5534937 but i will think twice about staying here alone over break for an extended period of time
5534938 how much do you bleed the golden goose until it cant lay any more golden eggs
5534939 i am more and more convinced the work the sisters of providence are doing needs to be done
5534940 we have been over the weekend and we will continue this week
5534941 there is a real need and were trying to fill that need and alleviate the suffering
5534942 surface vessels give us the capability to provide larger amounts of relief supplies because they can obviously carry more and they also give you platform to operate off of they give you aerial assets vertical lift those kind of things
5534943 imagine if you could download a song from amazon com and send it to the mobile phone of a friend or the car stereo of someone who has satellite radio
5534944 what separates the good athletes from the truly great ones how do you get to be as good as michael phelps
5534945 i know i forgot to take off the mini cheeseburgers

5534949 social media social networking and virtual worlds the ethical implications
5534950 enterprises are used to having everything managed and monitored with feedback and audits but this just doesnt exist in storage despite its growth
5534951 many organisations dont know how much capacity they have so they keep throwing boxes into their storage which is cheap but causes thermal problems in data centres and impacts things like recovery times and tape backups
5534952 the management tools methodology and experts method just havent been available
5534953 its easier to sell bucket loads of terabytes and worry about storage later
5534954 i see businesses with a lot of storage distributed across their datacentres in very distributed environments that are throwing terabytes at the problem and might not have the right staff and processes
5534955 one way to solve the problem is to give it away but thats not what many organisations want they could benefit greatly from getting experienced staff in or have a third party help them part time or remotely
5534956 the jetport commission feels that the county council is not willing to listen to the advice of the commission on matters affecting the aeronautics the operation of the county jetport and the jetport facilities
5534957 we feel that we cannot work under these conditions therefore as of this date we must give our resignation
5534958 we understand that we are only an advisory committee and have no decision making power
5534959 however we ask that the council give us the opportunity to present our recommendation before making a decision to act on matters concerning the jetport
5534960 without open communication between the council and the board you might as well do away with the jetport advisory commission
5534961 as pilots we feel that we have a good idea of what improvements are needed to move the jetport forward
5534962 council members dannie douglas wilhelmina johnson and anne warr all sat right here and said they didnt want to tear up that runway then they went in there monday aug 4 to that council meeting and voted to tear it up they sat right up in here and lied so you tell me what kind of people do we have in there
5534963 i think they the commission did not look at the safety and liability issues

5534984 up to 2 4 percent of the u s population self identifies as mixed race and most of these individuals describe themselves as biracial
5534985 we cannot underestimate the importance of understanding the social psychological and experiential differences that may increase the likelihood of psychological disorders among this fast growing segment of the population
5534986 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver that pregnancy
5534987 the evidence regarding the relative mental health risks associated with multiple abortions is more uncertain
5534988 never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world indeed it is the only thing that ever has
5534989 it does not seem to be related to anxiety and depression
5534990 the timing of the fertility peak in the third quarter suggests that the period of decreasing illumination immediately after the full moon may precipitate ovulation
5534991 a small but significant lunar rhythm of nutrient intake was observed with an 8 per cent increase in meal size and a 26 per cent decrease in alcohol intake at the time of the full moon relative to the new moon
5534992 the lunar cycle has an impact on human reproduction in particular fertility menstruation and birth rate
5534993 although the exact mechanism of the moons influence on humans and animals awaits further exploration knowledge of this kind of biorhythm may be helpful in police surveillance and medical practice he said
5534994 at this stage of investigation the exact mechanism of the lunar effect on the immune response is hard to explain the prime candidates to exert regulatory function on the immune response are melatonin and steroids whose levels are affected by the moon cycle
5534995 it is suggested that melatonin and endogenous steroids which are naturally occurring in humans may mediate the described cyclic alterations of physiological processes electromagnetic radiation and or the gravitational pull of the moon may trigger the release of hormones

5535010 ongoing media censorship the abuse of migrant construction workers who built the olympic venues and the unlawful forced evictions of hundreds of thousands of chinese citizens from their homes to make way for these venues
5535011 increasingly general electrics customers are chinese citizens who face systematic abuses
5535012 specific steps in line with their commitment to corporate social responsibility
5535013 no evidence that any of the olympic sponsors has followed up in any meaningful way on any of these recommendations
5535014 being a good corporate sponsor of the beijing games has sadly not meant being a good corporate citizen
5535015 the sponsors silence has only emboldened the chinese government and allowed the ioc to ignore the human rights standards it claims to uphold

5535041 thirty years ago 20 years ago we were the fruit pickers
5535042 we were the cotton chippers we did all this rural work we were the unskilled labourers in the rural industry
5535043 we created a false economy and then people got used to the idea of staying at home rather than actually going out and looking for work
5535044 and they did travel they used to move down to mildura they used to go out to moree they used to go all these areas doing the fruit picking doing the cotton chipping
5535045 the extension of the quarantining of welfare payments needs to be extended into the dole payments as well

5535055 commodore bainimarama at the pacific island leaders forum in tonga in october last year gave a faithful and unconditional undertaking to have an election in fiji before the end of march next year mr smith told sky news
5535056 he was compelled as a matter of honour to turn up to the forum and explain himself to the leaders
5535057 it is very disappointing that he wont turn up to effectively take his medicine
5535058 so its very disappointing and i think the leaders in niue including our own prime minister will understandably be very gravely disappointed at the refusal of commodore bainimarama to turn up
5535059 australia needs to argue strongly both regionally in the pacific and in the international community that fiji must return to democracy must return to respecting human rights and the rule of law and democratic processes in fiji

5535086 the city hopes cit an build better relationships with residents by busting the bad guys and rewarding the good ones
5535087 right now kids see police as the bad guys and thats not right

5535109 all who aspire to literary excellence in democratic nations ought frequently to refresh themselves at the springs of ancient literature there is no more wholesome medicine for the mind not that i hold the literary productions of the ancients to be irreproachable but i think that they have some special merits admirably calculated to counterbalance our peculiar defects they are a prop on the side on which we are in most danger of falling

5535121 the garnaut report recognises that existing environmental stress factors such as invasive species need to be dealt with now to reduce the costs of climate change and recommends the removal of introduced pest species as a key action to building this resilience she said
5535122 rodents pigs cane toads dogs cats and rapacious exotic plant species such as lantana and gamba grass have caused numerous extinctions in australia over the last 200 years and continue to devastate australias ecosystems
5535123 wwf is also calling on the australian government to close existing loopholes in quarantine laws that allow the importation of potentially devastating species such as the savannah cat which is a cross between a domestic cat and an african serval she said
5535124 if an otherwise sceptical media is doing its job on climate change it will start with just a couple of basic questions
5535125 questions such as how reliable are the good professors apocalyptic scenarios of the disappearance of the ski fields in australia the destruction of the great barrier reef and the kakadu wetlands the collapse of the murray darling basin as a productive region heat related deaths soaring millions more contracting dengue fever the inundation of hundreds of thousands of climate change refugees to australia and average australian wages dropping by 7

5535208 is it worth it yes because my district we need to know if we dont pass a bond there may never be a water bond in the next few years
5535209 to do this in the last several weeks of the legislative session is just ridiculous it shows a complete lack of maturity on behalf of the speaker and it shows why the speaker cant get a budget
5535210 for anyone to continue to say no to a responsible budget for no other reason that they are not able to deliver a water package to corporate agri business interests in this state is to me inexcusable

5535229 whether youre in kindergarten or third grade or no grade at all or any grade at all i like you just the way you are
5535230 i find it horribly ironic and paradoxical that at the same time we are struggling with energy independence that the congress and the current administration cant solve this issue

5535232 theres nobody down there in dire straits because they dont have any food or water right now
5535233 genuine risk passed away peacefully early this morning shortly after being turned out in her paddock
5535234 genuine risk was an amazing horse with tremendous heart that lived a life befitting a champion

5535236 their effort made up for the five catches we dropped and it augurs well for the future of canadian cricket
5535237 i am an opening batsman but i did what my captain asked me to and am pleased that i was able to play a role in my teams win
5535238 i worked very hard to get to this point because my dream was to play for canada when i got here
5535239 it was quite a performance from the young man in his first game
5535240 its a pity that our experienced players in the middle order did not come through
5535241 for the record i think you may be full of shit
5535242 ask most people about the value of a job and their first thought is how much it pays
5535243 by looking at the value proposition in a new way you can assess the job youre in as well as those youve had in the past
5535244 all of us have a choice between an attitude of abundance meaning there is more than enough opportunities money resources and so forth to go around and one of scarcity
5535245 choosing abundance empowers you to be a buyer and to maximize your giving and receiving you are not afraid to ask questions pursue opportunities and to more fully engage in negotiation
5535246 it is almost always better to have multiple good opportunities available to you in doing so you will be operating from abundance rather than scarcity
5535247 may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5535248 a completely unsubstantiated obama campaign claim that john mccain somehow cheated
5535249 level of objectivity has fallen so low that reporters are now giving voice to unsubstantiated partisan claims in order to undercut john mccain
5535250 we are concerned that your news division is following msnbcs lead in abandoning nonpartisan coverage of the presidential race
5535251 we have to deny russian strategic objectives which are clearly to undermine georgias democracy to use its military capability to damage and in some cases destroy georgian infrastructure and to try and weaken the georgian state
5535252 i think you can expect a strong message to russia
5535253 decisions by nato will be balanced and that responsible forces in the west will give up the total cynicism that has been so evident which is pushing us back to the cold war era
5535254 people are going to be coming into the city to see this and be part of it and anything that gets people into the city and opening their wallets gives shops a chance to make sales
5535255 this type of event puts down town hamil town on the map and makes it an item of international interest
5535256 i dont think this fits into that model i certainly dont think the council would be going out of its way to attract or support them
5535257 saat paling malang dalam sejarah hidup seorang anak muda ialah waktu dia duduk belajar tentang bagaimana untuk mendapatkan wang secara tidak jujur
5535258 from our perspective this government is clearly pursuing some wrong priorities so weve taken the decision to oppose measures that we frankly dont believe are in the national interest
5535259 we are concerned it has the potential to compound the problem of alcohol abuse in young and not so young australians
5535260 dr nelson needs to explain what impact his opposition to this measure will have on the health of young people and the sorts of outcomes we are trying to achieve for the community in making sure that young people have a healthier approach to the way they consume alcohol
5535261 if the liberal party are about to put their hands up to maintain a tax exemption or a special tax treatment for this category of alcoholic drinks which is specifically targeted at young girls the question i want to know is what do they believe the binge drinking rate will become on young girls in the future once they take this action
5535262 consider what we teach and the lord give you understanding in all things
5535263 we have a good relationship and love each other very much
5535264 so i think its time for us to move on
5535265 how do i get over this and keep the relationship going
5535266 if im so fucking great why are you leaving either you dont mean this or what
5535267 children are like mirrors to us reflecting back the very things we hate about ourselves imagine if you felt proud strong and in control so would your children they will do what you do not necessarily what you say they learn through imitation so if you dont like the way your children are behaving look at yourself for that is where the answers often lie
5535268 we know how to deal with it correctly without causing useless uproar among the people
5535269 the only reason some people get lost in thought is because its unfamiliar territory

5535300 although extreme gamers are heavily involved with the industry they represent a small portion of the potential market for any new game that comes to market
5535301 in order to promote continued growth we must better understand all of the gaming segments
5535302 the fleet seems to be running in circles stopping and going in different directions its the sixth day in a row that we have seen no whales transferred to the factory ship its unlikely that whaling is being undertaken
5535303 risk setting back the cause of whale conservation many years
5535304 stop threatening us mr campbell and charge us if you believe we are acting unlawfully stop posing for the japanese who are in blatant violation of international conservation laws
5535305 greenpeace has misled sea shepherd and betrayed us the japanese fleet does not give a damn about protests greenpeace just take pictures and hang banners we are down here to enforce international conservation law and to stop the illegal whaling operations
5535306 greenpeace distance themselves from sea shepherd because of their inability to commit to non violent tactics but well do what we can to put bodies between harpoons and whales and protect the whales non violently
5535307 they are sweeping along the antarctic coast corridor with radar and helicopter reconnaissance flights with the objective of ferreting out the positions of the illegal harpoon vessels

5535313 without her i think i would probably not make it but with her i can do anything
5535314 care giving is very hard because everybody says youve gotta take care of yourself that sounds very good but its very difficult to do
5535315 i went home and told him about the study and he said ah man i wish i had something like that when you were going through this because he felt very insecure himself

5535318 maybe some people are wired to be more sexual and also to have better erections for a longer period of time
5535319 do as the spirit moves you and make decisions about sexuality that are comfortable for you and your partner
5535320 if we put it onto our calendar when we have to have sex i think we lose the positive effect of sex on health
5535321 here i am sitting at a comfortable table loaded heavily with books with one eye on my typewriter and the other on licorice the cat who has a great fondness for carbon paper and i am telling you that the emperor napoleon was a most contemptible person but should i happen to look out of the window down upon seventh avenue and hear the sound of heavy drums and see the little man on his white horse in his old and much worn green uniform then i dont know but i am afraid that i would leave my books and the kitten and my home and everything else to follow him wherever he cared to lead my own grandfather did this and heaven knows he was not born to be a hero

5535339 a disconnect between kevin kjonaas and the publics idea of a terrorist
5535340 when youre on the receiving end of shacs campaign its violent and severe intimidation
5535341 the reality is that these people have killed no one
5535342 what is just screaming hypocrisy among these groups is the idea that you should blow things up but the minute you hurt an animal or a human it is automatically not one of their actions
5535343 its inevitable that someone will die at the hands of an animal rights firebomber

5535359 there are a lot of things i want to accomplish you prepare to play a full season and when its cut short thats disappointing

5535366 wisdom here is christ in whom are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge it is christ in the word and christ in the heart not only christ revealed to us but christ revealed in us
5535367 17 for if by the trespass of the one man death reigned through that one man how much more will those who receive gods abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man jesus christ 18 consequently just as the result of one trespass was condemnation for all men so also the result of one act of righteousness was justification that brings life for all men
5535368 20 the law was added so that the trespass might increase but where sin increased grace increased all the more 21 so that just as sin reigned in death so also grace might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through jesus christ our lord
5535369 1 what shall we say then shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase 2 by no means we died to sin how can we live in it any longer 3 or dont you know that all of us who were baptized into christ jesus were baptized into his death 4 we were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that just as christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the father we too may live a new life 5 if we have been united with him like this in his death we will certainly also be united with him in his resurrection 6 for we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be done away with that we should no longer be slaves to sin 7 because anyone who has died has been freed from sin 8 now if we died with christ we believe that we will also live with him 9 for we know that since christ was raised from the dead he cannot die again death no longer has mastery over him 10 the death he died he died to sin once for all but the life he lives he lives to god 11 in the same way count yourselves dead to sin but alive to god in christ jesus
5535370 the day they moved in i was surprised to see about 20 25 young girls and no sign of any men with them they all looked attractive if somewhat scantily dressed carrying their suitcases and stereos i just thought that perhaps this was workers accommodation for the hotel trade or something like that
5535371 i mean this is a residential area we have families here and they like me have all paid a lot of money to buy these properties when we found out what was going on some people just moved out and rented out their property as they couldnt stand the constant to ing and fro ing every night
5535372 i now go out in the morning to be greeted with the sight of used condoms littering the pavement and have regularly walked on hypodermic needles that have been thrown over my wall
5535373 mind you they must be focused on the money if the men i have seen going in there are is anything to go by some are pretty rough and ready others are drunk or high or both but over the week you do see all sorts visiting from smart businessmen lawyer bank types to older farmers and teenagers
5535374 i started taking down the registration numbers of hundreds of vehicles over a two month period and rather stupidly sent them to the police with an accompanying letter
5535375 i was now really frightened and knew then pursuing a case against this brothel would prove pointless and ultimately would be very dangerous for me i did however keep up a small but sustained form of mini sabotage just to make myself feel less helpless
5535376 for example there was a driver for one of the major tour companies who would arrive three afternoons a week to enjoy the girls hospitality
5535377 all of us were in the front room looking out and it was so satisfying seeing him trying to get out of this particular hole after a while he had to call a tow truck to rescue him
5535378 another ploy i used was when some men drove up dashed into the brothel leaving their car out front with the keys in the ignition this would happen a lot so i would then quietly get in their car and drive it away dump it then walk back to my house mind you i did feel a bit of a criminal doing that but you do go crazy living like this and end up doing things you wouldnt normally dream of doing anyway its just so immensely gratifying when they come out and think their car has been stolen and they have to then say where it was actually taken from
5535379 the place was raided by police from nicosia and things went quiet for a few weeks but then they started up again
5535380 i had bought this as my home and really liked the house now i just have to live with the situation as do my neighbours you cannot fight this sort of thing as its too bound up with money
5535381 i have become pretty philosophical about it all now but its terrible really the constant coming and going of cars never knowing who is outside your gate but always knowing why they are there and being fearful all the time its dreadful thats why i am always trying to be out with friends rather than staying indoors as it really is invasive i went to immigration once with a friend and i spotted a man i see almost every day coming in and out of the apartment block he was there holding a sheaf of foreign passports in his hand laughing and joking with immigration officers as if he owned the place i assume he is the girls pimp and thats just the way it is here sex is a commodity and from my experience it seems that there is no slowing down in demand for it in fact here it seems you can buy a woman as easy as picking up a macdonalds
5535382 by tbs japan in 2006 both shows sets up male and female celebrities together and then hands them a mission to accomplish on that episode the cameras follows the celebrities around the whole day plus having the same interview segments
5535383 the program has already been airing for a long time they claimed its plagarism because of one similar segment this is ridiculous
5535384 although the olympics is good to watch but we also want to watch we got married not only has it been pre empted for the past weeks but now with these plagarism allegations its quite a pity
5535385 i thought the program was really innovative all this while but now with these plagarism claims its pretty disappointing
5535386 i thought the program was really good to watch but since all these is copied i dont feel very good now
5535387 it is a bit like the american show blind date the show set up famous or semi famous young adults on a blind date and generally the date is planned put by the previous couple on the show and the cameras follow them around all day

5535680 the other night i ate at a real nice family restaurant every table had an argument going
5535681 our model assumed that we could integrate products in our holiday portfolio this year
5535682 we are now at a point where that is no longer possible
5535683 we welcome ea into our formal process and look forward to demonstrating the significant strides made by take two since they last undertook a detailed review of our business in early 2007
5535684 were hopeful that the diligence meeting will support the price of 25 74
5535685 however we have been price disciplined throughout this process and will continue to be so
5535686 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5535687 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5535688 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5535689 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5535690 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5535691 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5535692 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5535693 i received every award from every major veterans organization in america but the reason why i have a perfect voting record from organizations like the veterans of foreign wars the american legion and all the other veterans service organizations is because of my support of them ive been endorsed in every election by all of the veterans organizations that do that ive been supported by them and ive received their highest awards from all of those organizations
5535694 republican presidential candidate sen john mccain appeared tuesday to suggest rationing of veterans health care may be needed so combat veterans can receive the care they deserve
5535695 we need to concentrate our efforts to handle those wounds and disabilities that are directly the result of combat
5535696 so heres my idea and its not originated with me but ive consulted with so many others who are here look we need to concentrate our efforts to handle those wounds and those disabilities that are directly the result of combat we need to expand our ability to treat ptsd ptsd is going to be tough in this war you know that and we need to treat the combat wounds we need to increase that ability to do so
5535697 these wars are the first to be waged in large numbers by a new generation of brave women but 15 percent of our women soldiers that served on the front lines who walk into a va facility screen positive for military sexual trauma is senator mccain suggesting that we cant afford to give them benefits senator mccains campaign did not return calls for comment about his statement but these are questions he must answer all veterans respect john mccains service if he too respects ours he should not be suggesting that we shortchange our soldiers with non combat injuries who have served with such honor and dignity
5535698 after touring the manchester va medical center va secretary james peake also said he is against giving veterans cards to let them receive treatment at non va facilities
5535699 the bush administration and sen john mccain for that matter initially opposed passage of the legislation which was supported overwhelmingly by both democrats and republicans mccain campaigning last week used language suggesting he supported the bill in fact mccain did not even cast a vote on the final measure for bush and mccain to try to claim credit now for a bipartisan effort they both opposed is a plain attempt to hoodwink the american voter
5535700 under the webb bill veterans would receive maximum educational benefits after 36 months of service and those benefits would be tied to the full cost of public school tuition and expenses in the veterans home state the graham bill would require 12 years of service to garner a maximum benefit of 2000 per month with increases in that figure tied to the consumer price index critics point out that the cpi has been steadily outpaced by tuition increases
5535701 my proposal and others senator graham senator burn is well place incentives for people to stay in the military
5535702 yes the more you get because we want people to stay in we have to increase the benefits for the men and women who are serving and motivate those to serve
5535703 its a career jump for me but its also my home so its kind of like the best of both worlds
5535704 now i get the chance to cover the teams i grew up watching
5535705 we were attempting to delete those words as they came in but at that point we decided to pull away live because they were coming in fast
5535706 it was not our intent to air that and we apologize it got out
5535707 this is an opportunity to check out top amateur international boxers before they make their professional debut

5535731 they say im crazy but i have a good time im just looking for clues at the scene of the crime lifes been good to me so far
5535732 life loves to be taken by the lapel and told im with you kid lets go maya angelou
5535733 thomas jefferson once said we should never judge a president by his age only by his works and ever since he told me that i stopped worrying
5535734 no you must have misunderstood my request all i want is a new key not part ownership in the business
5535735 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5535736 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5535737 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5535738 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5535739 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5535740 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5535741 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5535742 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5535743 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5535744 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5535745 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5535746 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5535747 everything that goes into a life of pleasing god has been miraculously given to us by getting to know personally and intimately the one who invited us to god
5535748 so friends confirm gods invitation to you his choice of you dont put it off do it now do this and youll have your life on a firm footing the streets paved and the way wide open into the eternal kingdom of our master and savior jesus christ
5535749 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5535750 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5535751 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5535752 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5535753 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5535754 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5535755 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5535756 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5535757 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5535758 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5535759 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5535760 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5535761 is content to rely on the failed policies of president bush
5535762 is taking action to support american workers and american companies
5535763 this is made with material i prepared for fusion festival and is also an attempt to communicate new conceptions of hybridity by fusing sounds from disparate locations and eras into new musical entities with focus on traditional and regional music framed by urban bass and beats or is it the other way around
5535764 mashups a cheap one liner trend collapsing all narratives into a heap of meaningless garish post modern rubbish or a new way of interacting with cultures of thinking about the world of experiencing and creating music
5535765 ill support your move into budapest if you support my move into vienna the next turn
5535766 hey man sorry to screw you over but it was obviously in my best interests and if the positions were reversed wouldnt you have done it
5535767 the demand is quite dull as price are going up it will remain like this if price wont come down

5535774 this fizzy powder in the middle of my hoppy pop is so good its
5535775 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5535776 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5535777 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5535778 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5535779 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5535780 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5535781 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5535782 who are open to doing something on the production side
5535783 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5535784 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5535785 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5535786 first of all chris rock is still married and his wife picked out a beautiful gift for me after we finished shooting a marc jacobs purse it was only a movie
5535787 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5535788 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5535789 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5535790 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5535791 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5535792 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5535793 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5535794 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5535795 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5535796 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5535797 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5535798 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5535799 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5535800 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5535801 to attend a court hearing she also states her rate is 700 an hour
5535802 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5535803 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5535804 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5535805 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5535806 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5535807 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5535808 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5535809 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5535810 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5535811 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5535812 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5535813 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5535814 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5535815 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5535816 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5535817 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5535818 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5535819 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5535820 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5535821 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5535822 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5535823 i did give documents a long time ago but these matters have been resolved for a long time now as far as im concerned
5535824 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5535825 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5535826 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5535827 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5535828 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5535829 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5535830 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5535831 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5535832 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5535833 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5535834 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5535835 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5535836 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5535837 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on

5535864 youve challenged me to seduce the man of your dreams a virtuous love stricken man whose dedication to his work and his duties are legendary but he is after all a shameless smut addict it would be too easy i have a reputation to maintain after all
5535865 no im suggesting a more interesting target you like to change people destroy them so that theyre willing to do what you want im more interested in swaying them over despite their desires and despite their morals i suggest the seduction of a woman famous for her fidelity her integrity and her morality
5535866 despite the fact shes straight and madly in love with another man id make her beg for me despite her love despite everything that made her a worthy target

5535897 its not that easy when youre a woman there are
5535898 even if we dont have anything on him it doesnt mean we cant manufacture it and our point is everyone hates him no ones going to care if we get him accused of blowing up a village of starving children if we get him
5535899 angie are we still friends with that company you know the one out in vermont that does the special effects

5535903 does it really matter we send it to his superiors the real sort not like kersh we break it to the media that an fbi agent may be the biggest purchaser of crack on the east coast and hes gone if not fired at least in rehab
5535904 i love it i genuinely love it id ask for something that turns him wacky but were on a tight schedule so whatevers easy and on file well do

5535914 yeah her i know its weird but what the hell desperate times call for desperate measures huh
5535915 i know it sounds a little strange but jodys got the brains for the job and shes loyal i mean shes a little ambitious like all of us
5535916 but jody she wants what we want i really think shes perfect for the assignment i mean better than spender
5535917 sort of beavis called me in and talked about it i told him that i was always interested in helping with the project in fact what i told him you know his real names harry and i forgot and i almost called him beavis was really good i couldnt believe i did such a convincing job of course telling him i was just in it to fuck a couple of people and then take over the world would be suicide so i played up the innocent girl thing
5535918 we shall see lets go out for dinner out to lous okay
5535919 i hope that whatever i said to beavis did the trick
5535920 sometimes im afraid he knows im up to something you know but i acted like a team player and ive never done anything to him im not stupid

5535945 six months pretty new um i think i have to get these copied
5535946 but its nice meeting you mulder and scully right we should talk again okay
5535947 i think she could help us out she seems to want our help
5535948 i think wed be able to trust her she said something to you about consulting didnt she come on scully opportunities like this dont come up every day
5535949 mulder how do we know we can trust her i think that we have to be careful
5535950 scully im going by gut instinct here i admit it and we will be careful but whos it going to hurt if we help the valmont kid out on a few minor cases catch a few teenagers messing with cattle
5535951 all right well see if shes serious about consulting but mulder im serious cautiously
5535952 the residents of keskuwanna county have reported a werewolf and a little boy was mauled last night
5535953 keskuwanna county is a werewolf breeding ground about once a generation it gets out of control
5535954 sometimes i think the paranormal doesnt exist for the unbeliever
5535955 you know i mean i dont know when i was a little girl my dad died and two years later my mom saw him in a dream he told her that if we didnt leave new york right away something bad was going to happen my mom moved us to her mothers in virginia three weeks afterwards the apartment where wed lived burnt down
5535956 i think that the paranormal exists for who it needs to exist
5535957 it never has for me no matter how many times ive clapped my hands tinkerbell has never come back
5535958 in my experience i call it the dana scully syndrome
5535959 so it was just me and my mom and we were living in a bad part of la because we were fucking broke it was very tough there so i toughed up i learned how to defend myself because mom well mom has her own issues she kept telling me how one day wed live in a big malibu house and have a mercedes and eat out every meal it never did happen
5535960 you learn to deal dont you i mean somehow you learn to deal i bet your life hasnt been all wine and roses
5535961 i wish i could catch it its so hard to make friends with that woman
5535962 well i overheard you in the cafeteria one day youre her type i think
5535963 i mean it just looked that way to me why do you want to be her friend so much
5535964 hey valmont when you were a kid what was your favorite monster
5535965 i didnt like monsters i liked owls when owls swoop in for a kill theyre absolutely silent i always thought that was so neat
5535966 i hear you and johanna have a thing going on are you sure you dont know anything
5535967 johnny and i are pleasure not business she takes care of herself and i wouldnt be so quick to place the blame on her though im sorry her success is your failure
5535968 its a pity you ruined your chances through the fbi ive heard its a useful springboard to power
5535969 i think youve heard wrong jeff ive never seen that maybe whoever fucked you over did you a favor
5535970 necessity so what brings you down here my one and only
5535971 fun di fowley and i have come to an understanding i day trip to a few places usually obvious hoaxes but there have been two or three cases that ive needed my friends for theyre a fantastic consulting staff
5535972 well my dearest darling rat bastard i think im about ready to seduce mr mulder
5535973 it seems late to me but yeah mulder likes the package and he kind of trusts me besides i leak him information when i can
5535974 he slept with diana you know im his type hell think hes weak but that wont stop him if i throw myself at him
5535975 im making carne asada tonight dc sucks for mexican but i did my best

5535985 i dont think ive been in love really i mean theres something about that phrase you know its mystical i mean ive loved people and ive lusted after people i loved but its not like being in love you know
5535986 its one of those phrases like the truth i mean what the hell is the truth what does it mean to you
5535987 and someone else told me that theres nothing like that and that we make things up because were afraid that there may be nothing so we have to i dont know compensate make up meanings

5536017 its up to you give me a call if youre so inclined
5536018 i have to go home now i have work in the morning unlike dumbasses like you
5536019 but im more than happy to be the horizon you run to when she has left you
5536020 go to bed mulder i mean it you need to sleep once in a while
5536021 lets spend the night together now i want you more than ever
5536022 if you dont stop me i might hurt you again
5536023 youre so hot please dont stop thats just the place
5536024 oh usually i like it especially if its smothered in alfredo sauce and

5536026 i wanted to know if you wanted to come over for dinner tomorrow night at my place
5536027 sure kay but are you going to sacrifice me to your heathen god

5536032 hmm no its something fascinating very obscure based on an amerind folk legend
5536033 cool i once took an iowaska journey when i was in high school i found out my spirit guide is a lion headed eagle and that lucifer is a woman who drives an ice cream truck
5536034 whether chemical or psychological the effect is the same distortion
5536035 last i could tell he was a slut and a bastard were doing well
5536036 whatever you and krycek have in mind ms valmont id suggest you reconsider now
5536037 sir if im involved with agent mulder that doesnt have anything to do with krycek you or the project also im not fond of threats sir
5536038 watch yourself young lady you dont have anyone to support you right now
5536039 are you gonna blow me sky high like english jake
5536040 its not my fault your son is a cake boy pansy who couldnt deliver here
5536041 do what you want agent valmont ive done my duty
5536042 why does everyone assume our relationship needs to become physical
5536043 maybe we dont have sex because our relationship is not involved in any way shape or form with sex
5536044 do you wanna know why people ask why because you two radiate sex towards each other youre begging for it you two are insane i mean goddammit you want in her so bad i can almost taste it admit it when were in bed youve imagined her in my place
5536045 i wouldnt it would be wrong scully wouldnt act like this

5536127 i think im going to throw up he killed my father you know killed scullys sister too yeah i definitely need to throw up or maybe i just need to shoot him right now
5536128 there arent any cops or justice system on earth who could hold this guy johnny
5536129 you knew didnt you did it not occur to you that a thug with a fake arm might not be legit or did your leather fetish get the best of you
5536130 i was never one to judge a book by its cover mulder alex he got me past
5536131 did you have any idea i might hate his guts
5536132 no i didnt i swear before holy god mulder he gave me a good story i thought he was on the level and ive never had much sense when it came to sex he used me too
5536133 nope we could still kill him self defense no you sure
5536134 i would have probably done things a little differently had i known that you killed mulders father asshole
5536135 no for the first time in my life i think im not
5536136 or do you want us to stay here do you still need to throw up
5536137 i can get home all right johnny are you okay
5536138 just a bit pissed off its nothing like what you went through i think im gonna go home watch thelma and louise hate alex you know just blow off some steam
5536139 you suck johnny that was a shitty shitty way to do it
5536140 the man hates you you killed his father sue me if i cant mend the rift between capulet and montague its not like you two made my evening any fun i didnt come once
5536141 and i had to work to keep mulder from killing you do i hear one thank you johnny
5536142 maybe if youd planned this out better it would have been better
5536143 look unless i was peddling him drugs it wouldnt have been any better and you told me no drugs asshole
5536144 but it still happened you didnt specify good sex in our bargain
5536145 speaking of that i want to hear some ideas about making a play by the end of the week and be smart send them by courier or tell me in person loose lips sink ships
5536146 dont play stupid you got mulder i get your help i have it on tape
5536147 no you dont unless you had a personal tape recorder on you and thats bullshit if you did

5536227 the most triple xxx site on the net m m porn fantastick fantasys
5536228 look you think you got problems my lover and i made a bet that she couldnt fuck this woman and if she did id have to become her slave we also made a bet that she couldnt arrange a threesome between me her and this guy and she did that i mean there was no fucking way that she could pull it off it was impossible she tricked me
5536229 look son write a nasty power ballad about sarahs bitchy ways sell a million copies and sleep with bimbos for the rest of your life its a lot easier than falling in love and its a lot easier than dealing with an intelligent woman heres ten bucks keep the change
5536230 i dont know see this is different ive always been sort of well a slut i guess and ive had a few guys that ive really really thought i loved but most of the time they turn out to be assholes but this could be it i mean i did it right the way my grandma told me
5536231 she said you should only make love and she always used that phrase too she was a class act that you should only make love when you were friends best friends grandma was a deep believer in best friends make the best lovers
5536232 not now johnny i cant do any more im going to be bow legged tomorrow
5536233 so to your original question is it love i think id call it a qualified yes
5536234 ah ah ah if youre talking you cant be listening honey im not upset after all he came back from the dead for you pretty much there are connections there i couldnt ever imagine between the two of you just admit it youve been in love with mulder for a very long time
5536235 its a question of desire as its always been and the survey says
5536236 its not fair or right to you or mulder you cant be in love with two people
5536237 ill take that as a yes scully dana jeez i have to decide what name i like better you and mulder have history love a very complex and draining friendship you and i have known each other three months i dont expect to replace mulder in your affections
5536238 god youre too much youre enough to make anyone fall in love with you where did you learn to be so damned forgiving
5536239 i picked up my life philosophy on the road people are usually pretty fucked up you know
5536240 or maybe you dont know if you look for the screwed up bits youre never happy i mean yeah ive had some awful times in my life but i didnt even realize it sometimes because i was too busy enjoying even one ray of light im so self deluded i manage a lot of happiness
5536241 oh well honey then you also have to learn the other johnny valmont trick to living
5536242 carpe diem if you really want something go for it
5536243 but usually it works out youd be surprised how kind the world can
5536244 ill try it johnny im i think i am in love with you i love you i do and i want you to make love to me again right now
5536245 why are you late were you too busy licking carpet to come home on time
5536246 i got stuck in traffic and who the hell are you my husband i dont think so alex
5536247 im here because you own me i got mulder and now youre in bed with scully
5536248 but im not ever going to be number one in her books and i have other ambitions than to screw a pair of bumbling fbi agents all the time even though she admitted she loved me and i think despite the fact shes afraid of it she does
5536249 i have all sorts of plans i think ill keep my job with the fbi for the time being but weve definitely got to start moving you know smoking man threatened me a while back bastard i couldnt believe it
5536250 what do you mean youre keeping your job youre done now say good bye to mulder and scully and get your ass back to new york where you belong
5536251 one of the reasons i never called myself your girlfriend is because men always seem to think they have power in any sort of mutual relationship
5536252 im saying i fulfilled your little bet krycek even once you pulled that you have to seduce scully or youre my slave bullshit you belong to me now bitch and you better get used to it what i say goes do you understand me
5536253 i understand that youve fallen in love with scully and you want to have your cake and eat it too
5536254 let me tell you a story little johnny listen up because youve kind of been out of it lately
5536255 once upon a time there was a woman who wanted the world she was on her way to having it too but she got distracted she forgot the means were only means and that the greater glory awaited her
5536256 you see her cavorting with a few minor enemies got her noticed nobody really cared at first but then people started thinking maybe shed gone soft her motives were in doubt and shed also had the terrible taste to go and fall in love
5536257 she had a friend a lover really someone for whom she meant everything in the world he couldnt bear to see her fail he warned her about her troubles before it was too late
5536258 and then the woman went to her lover and told her that it was over the other woman protested a great deal but the woman kept telling her that it wasnt right what they were doing and it had to be over it had to be over
5536259 nobody up top is going to let a carpet licking bisexual slut get anywhere
5536260 id suggest letting the other one go too just in case he gets too attached he has a way of bringing down anyone who plays with him
5536261 i want to make love to you right here right now
5536262 i have to go in fact i need to tell you something
5536263 you look so serious like were never going to see each other again
5536264 always has been a man ive loved him for quite a long time and he loves me completely scully its more than you can say anyhow its beyond my control
5536265 if you you cant i love you i love you
5536266 god the sex really was good for you wasnt it
5536267 sweetheart youre deluding yourself youre so lonely that youve clutched on to the first halfway decent relationship you could now im going
5536268 im sorry youve been great better than i expected but im leaving
5536269 sure once but now its over and its quite beyond my control
5536270 the one about the woman who takes over the world once she breaks up with her lover then what happens
5536271 i told scully it was over so how does the story end motherfucker
5536272 you broke up with her because you were so sure someone cared
5536273 why would they care youre a woman in their minds youre all the same
5536274 i cared and besides its so amusing youre so hungry for power youd break your own heart i had you big time baby
5536275 be very very glad you love me alex because youd be dead now if you didnt now you listen to me very carefully asshole you made me break up with scully because you were jealous you lied to me now i have to win her back its going to take me a very long time and it will not be fun but after i do and i will youre going to be her slave if she says jump motherfucker you will say how high maam do you understand that i own you the videos in my hands tonight from now on you will do as i say or youll die do you hear me
5536276 i cant i im going ill bring you the video but you understand whats gone down between us
5536277 gotta go ive got better things to do than you tonight
5536278 well if you dont sleep with her youre still my slave
5536279 i mean it i wish i were a man so youd be more comfortable with this

5536329 theres a possibility that thats a cavity right there but its probably very small so i dont think ill do anything about
5536330 to laugh often and much to win the respect of the intelligent people and the affection of children to ear the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends to appreciate beauty to find the best in others to leave the world a bit better whether by healthy child a garden patch or a redeemed social condition to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived this is to have succeeded
5536331 you may hit your flush that boats up one of the villians and get squeezed for four big bets
5536332 but even as believers should learn to look for reasons behind their faith skeptics must learn to look for a type of faith hidden within their reasoning all doubts however skeptical and cynical they may seem are really a set of alternate beliefs if you went to the middle east and said there cant be just one true religion nearly everyone would say why not the reason you doubt christianitys belief a is because you hold unprovable belief b every doubt therefore is based on a leap of faith
5536333 with time and perspective most of us can see good reasons for at least some of the tragedy and pain that occurs in life why couldnt it be possible that from gods vantage point there are good reasons for all of them
5536334 one of the principles of love either love for a friend or romantic love is that you have to lose independence to attain greater intimacy if you want the freedoms of love the fulfillment security sense of worth that it brings you must limit your freedom in many ways human beings are most free and alive in relationship of love we only become ourselves in love and yet healthy love relationships involve mutual unselfish service a mutual loss of independence
5536335 think of people you consider fanatical theyre overbearing self righteous opinionated insensitive and harsh why its not because they are too christian but because they are not christian enough because they think of christianity as a self improvement program they emulate the jesus of the whips in the temple but not the jesus who said let him who is without sin cast the first stone
5536336 our culture therefore has no problem with a god of love who supports us no matter how we live it does however object strongly to the idea of a god who punishes people for their sincerely held beliefs even if they are mistaken
5536337 in short hell is simply ones freely chosen identity apart from god on a trajectory into infinity
5536338 we all knew we could have done better we all put in our best effort they were just the better team that day
5536339 were looking forward to it lets leave it at that
5536340 this is one of the strongest teams weve had as far as experience
5536341 we have to have a different mind set to be satisfied we need to go further

5536350 sridevi will be back with the film and the script is being finalised the film will be a sequel and not a remake of mr india anil kapoor is very excited about the film while boney is leaving no stone unturned to make the film bigger and better than the first part this time the audience will be in for a visual treat as there will be a whole lot of special effects in the film boney is also planning to tie up with a major sfx company this film is the key reason why sridevi turned down so many film offers recently she was waiting for mr indias sequel to make her comeback
5536351 mr india was a superhit film people still remember all the characters of the film and the very prospect of a sequel is gathering a lot of interest sridevi has lost oodles of weight and is looking fabulous these days she is very excited about her comeback
5536352 yes i am finally going ahead with happy new year we have made some changes in the earlier script the truth is i wanted to make happy new year before om shanti om but i wasnt ready with the script then om shanti oms script fell into place and things started to roll so we made om shanti om first
5536353 i plan to have an interesting cast along with shah rukh but i still havent decided how many of the actors will be established and how many will be newcomers
5536354 the first half of the script for happy new year is ready shirish her husband has helped me a lot with the films script
5536355 oh well i cant say much about the film at this point of time but yes it will be my kind of cinema i dont want to prove a point to anybody happy new year will be a commercial entertainer
5536356 i am not going to exotic places to write the story and while i am busy with the script i am concentrating on my babies too
5536357 i catch up with shah rukh and karan johar often recently shah rukh was shooting at yash raj studios and i dropped by to visit him with anya diva and czar in tow of course i had also taken three of my maids who i have for my kids it was good fun
5536358 karan wanted me to do a song in dostana moreover i had promised tarun mansukhani dostanas director that i will choreograph a song in the first film which he will direct
5536359 in fact karan made a very sweet offer to have a huge vanity van for me with all the facilities so that i can take my babies along with me but theyll remain at home ill reach the sets by 10 30 am and leave by 6 pm every day

5536372 the spread of democracy in the last two decades of the 20th century was not merely the unfolding of certain ineluctable processes of economic and political development the global shift toward liberal democracy coincided with the historical shift in the balance of power toward those nations and peoples who favored the liberal democratic idea a shift that began with the triumph of the democratic powers over fascism in world war ii and that was followed by a second triumph of the democracies over communism in the cold war the liberal international order that emerged after these two victories reflected the new overwhelming global balance in favor of liberal forces but those victories were not inevitable and they need not be lasting today the reemergence of the great autocratic powers along with the reactionary forces of islamic radicalism has weakened that order and threatens to weaken it further in the years and decades to come

5536382 we are a better company as a result of supporting the olympics and the olympics are a better movement as a result of our support
5536383 we grabbed the volume control and took it all the way down to zero and gradually found a way to bring it back to celebratory
5536384 i am elated and delighted to be joining the cast of csi
5536385 believed that freedom to think as you will and to speak as you think are means indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth that without free speech discussion would be futile
5536386 the premise that money matters to ladies is correct but the theory fails to consider that many females arent looking for chump change theyre looking for a chump to gold dig in order to find that guy with a large bank account or upward mobility ladies need to go to where the boys are especially in new york city were the ratio of guys to females is 9 to 10 ladies figure that more guys will go to a club where the admission price for guys is less and follow the boys there
5536387 the ladies who party at nightclubs however are a different story they belong to a group that controls over 50 of the nations wealth and makes 80 of the purchases
5536388 the only matter unworthy of serious attention in this lawsuit is the defense attorneys advocating that guys should financially subsidize females to party
5536389 if aer reverses the price for guys and ladies charges ladies what it does guys and guys what it charges ladies the plaintiff class will settle sounds fair after all if the price now charged men is not so burdensome then by charging it to females instead it shouldnt be burdensome either
5536390 vamos a ser una naci n decentemente gobernada o si vamos a ser un adefesio o un antro criminal como es la cuba de hoy

5536394 there isnt a lot of volume so though were down a lot i dont think it necessarily signifies a change in sentiment
5536395 its healthy in these kinds of markets for people to have time to breathe or take time to consolidate before you continue the uptrend
5536396 regarding the treasurys new authorities the secretary has said many times he has no intentions of using it
5536397 continue to provide stability and liquidity to the housing market
5536398 the centerpiece of our regulatory approach is giving investors the information they need to make wise decisions
5536399 we have an opportunity to exponentially improve the way we perform that mission
5536400 by entering new markets especially alt a and subprime and guaranteeing more of our customers products at market prices we met our goal of increasing market share from 22 to 25 percent
5536401 a lot of people drive into water of unknown depths

5536409 i can tell you one of the reasons that the public schools of our city have gotten better is because the charter schools exist and give parents an alternative and let parents see that you can do something better

5536417 by letting them have their say in whatever we are doing
5536418 if i was making mean jokes to a person i would remember how bad id feel if that happened to me

5536421 fbi scientists early on had but destroyed the unique strain of anthrax used in the deadly 2001 attacks that years later would lead them to dr bruce ivins this was anthrax that ivins took from his army lab in february 2002 and gave investigators
5536422 the sample kept at the fbi lab was destroyed because the bureau believed it might not have been allowed as evidence at trial
5536423 now that dr ivins is dead and he wont have a trial no evidence will ever be admitted have you destroyed the rest of the evidence yet
5536424 advised the fbi in its initial investigation of the anthrax letters
5536425 how can you have the energy to care any more
5536426 i need there to be a reason to keep going if that means caring so be it

5536430 but i was gonna kiss you right back at the same time
5536431 i wish we had some of my moms chicken soup
5536432 no but dont you ever wonder what fate has against the two of us together
5536433 does that mean you want to live unhappily ever after like this going in an eternal ring around the roses
5536434 you remember that i remember i thought you were gone delirious i was pretty delirious at the time too but i started singing too
5536435 it was a teenaged wedding and the old folks wished em well
5536436 you could see that pierre did truly love the mademoiselle and now the young monsieur and madame have rung the chapel bell cest la vie said the old folks it goes to show you never can tell

5536446 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5536447 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5536448 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5536449 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5536459 what sibel revealed to us and has been revealing little by little since january is that she has heard that there was a nuclear procurement ring operating inside the us to procure nuclear designs and parts for the aq khan network and it was done not through pakistani intelligence directly but through the turkish embassy turkish businessmen who got the information and gave it to turkish military attaches who then turned it over to the isi and from there went on to the nuclear black market to procure these parts and designs high government us officials helped facilitate turkish israeli phd students to get into nuclear facilities in the us they worked with the rand corporation as well some moles with rand to help get this information there was at least one american company giza technologies that was helping with parts probably there were others and this thing went on from 1995 at least until 2002 and it could still be going on when this operation was shut down by the dept of defense and the state dept now sibel tells us that high government officials inside those two departments defense and state were involved in this ring she has named them on her website at least she has not named them she has photographs of people other bloggers have named them
5536460 centrism is the philosophy of the american media and that essentially backs the status quo when youre a centrist and this game of objectivity that they play is really limited by parameters that youre allowed to ask questions and to investigate and in a sense then youre transmitting these assumptions and reinforcing every day that the us is really a functioning democracy
5536461 a political odyssey the rise of american militarism and one mans fight to stop it
5536462 the internets solution to the dearth of local news coverage is the same as it has been with other problems of scale let the people build it themselves in looking at sites like metroblogs gothamist publications outside in nowpublic baristanet and topix the site that i run it becomes apparent that a massive amount of attention and investment has been paid to giving people a platform for engagement with the places they live
5536463 w ell use that time to become essentially 100 percent local which is probably where were headed eventually anyway
5536464 they hung me up across an iron gate then they yanked open the gate and my whole body lifted until my chest nearly split in two

5536476 we have firsthand descriptions of biological weapons factories on wheels and rails

5536532 i envision somebody doing a theme that makes communityengine act more like a social network a theme that makes it act more like a blog a theme that makes it act more like a group blog or a newspaper so you can pick and choose
5536533 borrowing noticeable cues from other brands like mercedes benz the amantis designers ended up with a rather awkward overall look
5536534 the kia amanti is styled like one of lee iacoccas k cars of the 1970s
5536535 certainly knows how to make an entrance the tall body big grille and headlight treatment stir up memories of a number of luxury cars
5536536 vertical taillights and a taller profile that give the rear a much fuller figure
5536537 if you wedge the amanti headfirst into a tight parking spot the trunk looks a bit like that of any six figure ultraluxury car
5536538 nice touches like tasteful faux wood and metallic accents a leather covered front console armrest
5536539 gauges are large and easy to read with most commonly used controls falling readily to the drivers hand
5536540 some testers found the center stacks look alike controls to be hard to identify quickly in low light conditions
5536541 the attractive 2008 kia amanti dash employs a split level two tone design with a prominent analog clock or optional information screen taking center stage
5536542 the v 6 is quite capable stymied by a sluggish transmission
5536543 the v6 provides more than adequate power in any situation
5536544 many drivers will still find the ride quality to be overly floaty
5536545 the v 6 is quite capable delivering energetic acceleration from on ramp stoplights all the way up to highway speeds and passing at 60 to 70 mph is nearly as easy
5536546 the v6 provides more than adequate power in any situation
5536547 the v6 is matched to a five speed automatic transmission with manual shift control
5536548 quick downshifts assure that the power is always on tap for merging onto fast moving freeways or quick passes on two lane roads
5536549 the drivetrain looks good on paper but in practice its stymied by a sluggish transmission toe the gas for power coming out of a corner and youll often catch the automatic loitering in the higher gear you were in when you entered the turn
5536550 test kia amanti 2008 averaged 17 8 mpg in city highway driving
5536551 one of the floppiest rides on the market a comfortable highway and byway cruiser for nonenthusiasts but with numb steering a soft suspension
5536552 unusually soft suspension absorbs most smaller bumps fairly well but can be poorly composed over sharper bumps and potholes in city driving
5536553 highway speeds bring an undue amount of bobbing over larger road imperfections
5536554 suspension refinements last year sharpened the handling but many drivers will still find the ride quality to be overly floaty
5536555 the pedal feels a bit on the mushy side but it delivers firm stopping power when pushed hard
5536556 tuned to provide a smooth quiet ride with maximum isolation from the road
5536557 a bit less rear hip and legroom than youll find in slightly larger toyota avalon
5536558 interior volume measures 106 cubic feet competitive with the avalon and impala
5536559 big trunk is usefully shaped and has a large opening in cabin storage includes a map pocket in each door a two level console bin and a good sized glovebox
5536560 though not quite to premium car standards 2008 kia amantis interior is nicely finished with soft high quality materials
5536561 the cabin is impressively hushed with very little wind or road noise
5536562 the v6 engine produces a refined muted growl when pushed but is otherwise nearly silent
5536563 the amanti is tuned to provide a smooth quiet ride with maximum isolation from the road
5536564 front and rear side impact airbags and side curtain airbags
5536565 an optional 2008 kia amanti package bundles stability and traction control systems with a brake assist feature
5536566 outward visibility is good though very tall drivers may find that the inside rearview mirror is mounted low enough to interfere with their forward view
5536567 an optional 4 inch display monitor with a trip computer and digital clock can supplement the center analog clock
5536568 opt for the leather package youll get leathers seats heated front seats two memory settings for the driver seat a trip computer and an upgraded infinity sound system with a six cd changer
5536569 even cooler for the president whos probably happy that someone popular wanted to get a picture with him
5536570 maybe a little bit deflated the euphoria that obama and the obama camp had after that fabulous middle eastern and european tour
5536571 they jumped on it really fast sometimes conditions just combine to make it difficult to catch
5536572 lured me with its cute looks it seemed more stylish and better looking than other minivans
5536573 the kia sedona looks classy and stylish if the 2008 kia sedonas styling isnt unique it is clean and crisp and classy
5536574 except for its vertical taillamps the 2008 kia sedona doesnt carry itself much differently than a toyota sienna which wouldnt be impossible to mistake for a honda odyssey
5536575 wood look trim thats reminiscent of wood paneled wagons and dens from the brady bunch era
5536576 are within easy reach are nicely sized and are clearly marked
5536577 if theres evidence showing how toyota on price the interior is where youll find it
5536578 acceleration proved to be enough to give it a fighting chance
5536579 comfortable for a minivan but it is not quite car like
5536580 the 2008 kia sedonas 3 8 liter v 6 develops 250 hp and 253 pounds feet of torque
5536581 acceleration proved to be enough to give it a fighting chance in cutthroat los angeles traffic making it a sleeper of sorts passing nimbler suvs made driving a minivan easier on the ego
5536582 it is geared for rapid acceleration if the driver pushes down on the pedal with authority or it smoothly upshifts at low rpm when moving along in a leisurely fashion
5536583 17 9 mph for the life of the car and frequently noted as impressive on long road trips
5536584 the 2008 kia sedona averaged 22 7 mpg in mostly highway driving 18 1 with more city use a second test model averaged 16 1 mpg in mostly city driving and gas eating acceleration tests sedona uses regular grade gas
5536585 sedona is comfortable for a minivan but it is not quite car like the suspension smoothes out small bumps well but it bounces some over larger humps
5536586 kia has done a terrific job with the suspension tuning on the sedona absorbent over bumps yet able to produce stable handling the toyota sienna with a little extra communication tossed in for the driver and motion control for the passengers
5536587 39 6 foot turning circle isnt out of line for a vehicle of its size the sedona isnt as maneuverable in tight parking lots as some of its competitors
5536588 this baby was kind of hard to steer it often felt as if it just didnt know how to move the parts it came equipped with
5536589 short on soft touch surfaces and long on nondescript plastics
5536590 interior noise levels that allow for easy three row conversations
5536591 lots of legroom in the middle row too which made it a comfy ride for adult and child passengers alike
5536592 front occupants find comfortable chair height seats yet there is ample headroom although lanky drivers may want more rearward seat travel
5536593 tight 3rd row is adult comfortable for short trips only
5536594 third row headroom in the short wheelbase sedona drops 1 9 inches compared to the long wheelbase version and shoulder room falls 3 3 inches second row occupants lose 3 9 inches of legroom as well
5536595 roomy and versatile with a flip and fold second row and a third row that disappears into the floor
5536596 cargo capacity behind the third row drops considerably from 32 2 cubic feet to just 12 9 cubic feet
5536597 there were eight cupholders there was also ample storage space in the front two glove compartments a nice center console that held my huge purse diaper bag with room to spare
5536598 cabin is short on soft touch surfaces and long on nondescript plastics but the materials are mostly in line with the price
5536599 one test ex suffered annoying rattles from the 2nd and 3rd row seats
5536600 leather on the steering wheel doesnt feel much like leather and the cowhide on our ex models seats was soft but artificial to the touch
5536601 interior materials consisted of an obvious plastic that lacked some luster
5536602 kia seems to use chintzier plastics and lower grade leather in the interior those plastics and leather have become glossier and more worn than the odysseys interior over a similar period
5536603 engine makes a semi refined full throttle growl and is reasonably quiet otherwise
5536604 tire thrum and body rumble are noticed even during in town driving with wind rush joining in at highway speeds
5536605 has achieved a five star crash certification in all seating positions from the federal government and a top safety pick rating from the insurance institute for highway safety
5536606 the kia sedona 2008 front passenger airbag turns itself off if a child is in the seat
5536607 seat mounted side impact airbags and side curtain airbags that protect outboard occupants in all three rows of seats are standard
5536608 stepping up to the sedona ex adds fog lights and an auto dimming rearview mirror
5536609 the thick windshield pillars can impede visibility to front corners but there are clear sightlines elsewhere
5536610 visibility rearward from the 2008 kia sedonas drivers seat is especially good an important contribution to safety because the rear window is as big as it can be and the headrests over the five rear seats sink down to the tops of the seats
5536611 standard power sliding door windows are a fresh air plus
5536612 tri zone air conditioning a cd player cruise control second row captains chairs and keyless entry with an alarm

5536620 we hope for an excellent contract but you never know
5536621 if we have to strike we will its not what we hope for but were prepared to do it
5536622 another is wages versus the cost of living workers are being pinched in this economy paying more for food and fuel so paychecks dont go as far as they used to
5536623 im hoping for more money on the pensions maybe 300 to 400 more per month
5536624 whats the use of a 5 raise if our health insurance goes up 50 a week
5536625 we feel like were talking about issues that the company can afford to address
5536626 i turned on the hose and lit the fire and boom
5536627 shaken cart worker alla ali 50 said of the 9 a
5536628 running out of the house yelling get em off me
5536629 you wouldnt expect 45 nm to be running hotter and you wouldnt expect it to be running slower and you wouldnt expect it to be more expensive
5536630 so if you look at 65 nm compared to 45 nm there is a definitive opportunity for improvements in performance power and price
5536631 it will hit once the price of ddr3 comes down
5536632 the back half of next year 2009 is about the time the process changes in ddr3 will happen that will allow the prices to come down

5536634 well if he got them here i would think there would be other kids who also got mosquito bites
5536635 im afraid i cant speak to the specifics of that letter and will not today
5536636 we remain suspended for the moment in afghanistan out of respect for the victims of this horrible crime
5536637 the change is that we suspended operations and we are looking at all of our processes
5536638 were looking at if and how we can continue working there to safeguard our international and national staff
5536639 we are surely committed to the afghan people as were jacqui nicole shirley and mohammad the four individuals that were killed
5536640 the young canadian women that were killed they were there to assist afghan kids go to school there are more young afghan kids in school including girls than ever before as result of this kind of humanitarian assistance
5536641 over the years weve worked there weve had various levels of insecurity to deal with and weve adjusted our operations accordingly
5536642 the area in which we work has been one of the safer areas although we have seen an increase in insecurity
5536643 in most environments where we work there are markings on our vehicles in afghanistan we dont use them anymore for obvious reasons
5536644 but what we do in situations like that or even as a result of what happened more recently we reassess our operations and security
5536645 but we are committed to stay on the ground and continue the work that we are doing but to ensure that we do it in as safe as possible means
5536646 were not going to respond to threats and certainly it will have no effect on canadian policy
5536647 great wall is an olympic feat all its own great wall makes for one big hurdle
5536648 you might not be able to see ba da ling from space but theres some chance of smelling the toilets

5536653 sen mccain is expected to host a rally on august 29 in dayton and is looking for a big venue and for a big crowd hell get it this is not yet public i guess i just made it so
5536654 we expect airplanes to be less full and skies to be less crowded this labor day holiday
5536655 economic uncertainty and the heavy hit from sky high energy prices mean that many vacation and business travelers are choosing to stay closer to home if they go at all
5536656 libraries are safe havens to discover the world around us
5536657 we cant have enough libraries in our community its a living laboratory that we can build in a way that can also help sustain us going into the future
5536658 it has more computers and more space for books and people including a meeting room an adult literacy center and special storytelling areas for children and teenagers
5536659 in our view any house member who goes to a party that honors a member or a group of members is violating the ethics rules
5536660 its a violation of the spirit the language and the meaning of the provisions
5536661 these are all the same people who have a big lobbying presence in d c and they all have major issues before congress and the executive branch
5536662 the rules they lay out are what we abide by
5536663 if its a dinner or reception you can have background music
5536664 the platform is written the vice presidential nominee is chosen what else are they going to do but party
5536665 the public has no idea whether those studies have been submitted to the epa or not and if so what they show maybe they never came in maybe they came in and they show a real problem for bees maybe theyre poorly conducted studies that dont satisfy epas requirement
5536666 weve been monitoring the bee die off situation for a couple of years and its a complex puzzle that may also involve mites viruses and other factors

5536676 im not saying that i have this all together that i have it made but i am well on my way reaching out for christ who has so wonderously reached out for me friends dont get me wrong by no means do i count myself an expert in all of this but ive got my eye on the goal where god is beckoning us onward to jesus im off and running and im not turning back so lets keep focused on that goal those of us who want everything god has for us if any of you have something else in mind something less than total commitment god will clear your blurred vision youll see it yet now that we are on the right track lets stay on it stick with me friends keep track of those you see running this same course headed for this same goal there are many out there taking other paths choosing other goals and trying to get you to go along with them ive warned you of them many times sadly im having to do it again all they want is the easy street they hate christs cross but easy street is a dead end street those who live there make their bellies their gods and belches are their praise all they can think of is their appetities but theres far more to life for us were citizens of high heaven were waiting of the savior the master jesus christ who will transform our earthy bodies into glorious bodies like his own hell make us beautiful and whole with the same powerful skill by which he is putting everything as it should be under and around him

5536680 what i actually said is that islam prohibits a muslim from changing his religion and that apostasy is a crime which must be punished
5536681 o n the matter of support for ali goma it seems rather ironic that right wing critics share their worries over our stance probably to their horror with marxists on the far left such as the uk guardians seamus milne

5536712 it was hard for some to give up the idea that telstra is community property the cultural change required by privatisation was difficult both for telstra and for the government
5536713 stop listen to mommy or youre going to have a time out stop stop all right time out it is
5536714 writing is easy all you do is sit staring at a blank sheet of paper until the drops of blood form on your forehead
5536715 this case starkly demonstrates the take no prisoners approach of the gay rights movement they will not stop until they have silenced or bankrupted every voice of conscience who disagrees with them in light of this and similar rulings pji is redoubling its efforts to defend people of faith who will not compromise their moral values

5536733 well folks hey you live in georgia good luck with that weather thing
5536734 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
5536735 we the citizens of the united states of america have the ultimate responsibility to elect the
5536736 americans need to get over the political bigotry that there are only two parties
5536737 must be astonishing to canadians who have a multiparty system
5536738 mainstream political parties can essentially cooperate in failing to even attempt to solve problems faced by a majority of citizens usually because they have been funded and supported in other ways by large corporations
5536739 naders presidential campaign as with other similar past campaigns by independents and third parties serve the purpose of educating people about the huge gaps in the mainstream parties platforms
5536740 not stupid theyve developed a highly proficient way of censoring themselves
5536741 until these loopholes are closed you will continue to see regular dishonest unethical secretive unrepresentative and wasteful actions by governments and corporations
5536742 hello americans cut the crap stop making excuses and take over
5536743 protest the corporate control over our political system and to call for opening the presidential debates
5536744 he was obviously uncomfortable and we were uncomfortable you cant just develop policy on the spot so not knowing who this person was i had no idea what his standards were and i think we certainly had the discretion to ask him to leave
5536745 im an independent reporter who does original research and has a record of being credentialed

5536748 free us from our addiction to oil from 4 00 plus per gallon gas
5536749 there is no time to waste we want a better future we demand a better future we the american people are no longer asking
5536750 the free us ad takes a different tone than our previous efforts
5536751 this ad issues a direct and compelling challenge and juxtaposes the stark imagery of our addiction to fossil fuels with the earnest faces of the american people who are calling for answers and solutions now it takes the call for renewable energy from a request to a demand
5536752 the conventions are about coming together to choose the ideas and the people who will lead us forward
5536753 the next american president has the inescapable responsibility to move our country away from fossil fuels and toward clean sustainable energy sources our economic and environmental futures depend on it and the american people are demanding it
5536754 but i see that r james woolsey a former director of the c i a serves on the board of american congress for truth your educational foundation

5536756 sen obama made it clear that he was really going to get into the nuts and bolts of the kinds of questions oregonians are talking about and i think it has served him well in our state
5536757 im confident that once sen obama gets as well known in these larger states as he has in oregon he is going to see the same success elswhere
5536758 if they would only let her into the debates and stand on the same stage with all the leaders people would be able to compare and see that for themselves
5536759 efforts to build and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
5536760 to go from a small town like taunton and go to america and do all the research he does especially this as part of the nobel peace prize is a great achievement
5536761 the port authority wants to be the best environmental steward of the river it can be
5536762 i think the port authority is misspending state transportation dollars to diminish the capacity of our river transportation system by needlessly moving this barge service facility from one location thats superior to a second location thats operationally inferior

5536767 we are immediately going to help colleagues from different communities who are experiencing a difficult situation due to lack of potable water food and clothing
5536768 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context what theyre putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5536769 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context what theyre putting out privately is that mccain may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5536770 if the convention wasnt in st paul i wouldnt be at the convention
5536771 there are going to be many districts where the obama campaign helps our candidates but our candidates are going to bring out people and we want to be sure they vote for obama as well
5536772 is weve had only one class 3 assembly come through our place since ive been working there and it was nowhere as good a quality as this board is
5536773 painting a quality pcb is a pleasurable work of art to have
5536774 has to do with the quality of the pcb and the quality of the assembly process resulting in the overall quality of workmanship
5536775 class construction has nothing to do with the quality of the engineering that went into the product save the manufacturers ability to assemble the device

5536805 the institutional culture of corruption embraced by the clinton leadership of the democratic party
5536806 unaccountable power for the clintons at the expense of the rule of law and respect for the constitutional processes of government
5536807 especially since it was days after she said she wouldnt take any more money from me
5536808 sen obama needs someone experienced in foreign policy and or running a state or corporation joe biden would be good

5536816 he understands the issues and is interested and excited by the work we are doing to educate and involve the people

5536845 well in the final maybe you did that in the primary dukakis but in the final its all its all this kind of stuff
5536846 get it off the air and i really mean it
5536847 i know what im walking into here i know there are some people who are going to try to take advantage of this but were going to take them on
5536848 well who is this guy anyway youre changing youre moving from here to there everywhere
5536849 hey those attacks that are coming from mccain heres the truth
5536850 look give me a summary of the kinds of things we want to say
5536851 i am married to the next president of the united states
5536852 run for governor ok what do i have to do
5536853 making up your mind questions to consider before the next election
5536854 heres what i want you to do between now and election
5536855 dont just look at issues look at character issues are important but you also have to look at character
5536856 theyre saying im totally self sufficient in myself and nobodys self sufficient enough to be president its too big a job
5536857 rick warren is at the forefront of a kind of younger generation of evangelical protestant leaders who want to have a christian public presence in the culture but who are less tied to the republican politics of their predecessors
5536858 theyre values oriented guys but less convinced that either their own principles or the best politics lies in a total commitment to the republican party
5536859 we are one of those people that make over 250 000 a year and i dont agree that that makes us rich
5536860 even with that kind of income we struggle to pay everything we have gotten ourselves into
5536861 im pretty much a dyed in the wool republican and i was a marine what he went through for five years you gotta hand that to him
5536862 i mean come on whoever buys into that they gotta have a screw loose
5536863 just stay in the senate stay busy learn more foreign policy and come back in ten years obama and i betcha id vote for you
5536864 hes as genuine as can be its just hes a green apple hanging on the tree and mccain is a ripe red apple ready to be picked obama just needs to ripen some more
5536865 barack obama is going to get the same percentage of the religious vote that john kerry and al gore got
5536866 thats christian identity politics and im sure it has some influence but i dont think at the end of the day its the deciding factor
5536867 jimmy carter could have come in here and sounded much more comfortable with his faith but people having seen a jimmy carter presidency would not vote for him just because theyre likely to see him in heaven
5536868 study all the different candidates at every different level you need to register to vote and then you need to vote
5536869 when i hear people say i dont like either of the candidates im just not going to vote i want to say to them well then you need to move to another country because people died for that vote
5536870 venga m ster que s lo queremos darle la bienvenida usted tambi n tiene que firmar
5536871 vicente es as le conozco de antes lo que tiene es la ilusi n de hacer las cosas bien
5536872 tiene ganas de trabajar y de seguir con el proyecto que hab a antes
5536873 tengo la obligaci n de mantener y potenciar lo conseguido el esp ritu la cohesi n de grupo y la humildad
5536874 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5536875 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5536876 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5536877 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5536878 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5536879 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
5536880 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
5536881 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
5536882 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
5536883 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
5536884 a m en 1988 me puso de interior en un partido amistoso porque faltaba gente y para que me acostumbrara a jugar el bal n con los pies
5536885 ha insistido mucho en la estrategia en que no se me caiga el larguero sobre la cabeza
5536886 es algo que tambi n hac a el curso pasado en el filial
5536887 nos remarcaba que as ayud bamos en la presi n conjunta del equipo
5536888 de jugar pendiente de los pases largos que van por detr s de la zaga
5536889 implica tener mucha concentraci n pero m s que tener buenos pies hay que estar perfectamente colocado en armon a con los movimientos de los centrales
5536890 tambi n es un ejercicio de confianza hacia los porteros porque dejamos muchos metros a nuestras espaldas
5536891 y todos los del bar a se desenvuelven de maravilla en estos espacios
5536892 ni fallar en el corte porque dejamos la porter a vac a
5536893 i have long said that the central terrorist threat to the united states lies in northwest pakistan and afghanistan and not iraq
5536894 u s policy must focus on assuring that all elements of pakistans government are resolute in shutting down the safe havens for al qaida and the taliban there can be no safe haven for terrorists who threaten the american people
5536895 critical theater in countering the threat of al qaida and violent islamic extremism
5536896 i look forward to the government increasing its future cooperation
5536897 preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion
5536898 team genius makes great scratchy and nerdy indie pop from the midwest
5536899 were very very excited about it were piecing together the recording at a studio in bushwick ny with a great engineer producer named justin coletti and then taking care of overdubs and mixing with a friend in park slope matt filler of the band monacle on hidden shoal records weve got about three tunes finished and several others somewhere in the process well eventually have about 12 to 13 total ive always been a pretty schizophrenic songwriter so im letting myself go in that direction a little more and the album is shaping up to have a good deal of variety id been thinking about it for a while now and i dont know of too many albums that attempt a lot of different sounds but that is what everyone ends up listening to when they dial up stuff on their ipod were keeping up with the layered multi instrument sound that was prevalent on some of the ep but trying to make sure retain some of the pop smarts and songwriting logic weve got a number of friends playing on it and just welcomed a new member named rebekah allen a lovely gal who specializes in trumpet and accordion in addition to those fine instruments the album is featuring a whole circus of noise makers mandolin violin viola cello melodica harmonica flute sax and vocoder
5536900 these midwestern transplants first caught my ear as a trio under the name g whiz now grown to a quintet and certifiably a brooklyn band i e theyre quirky and have lived in nyc over a year team genius defies greenpoint trendiness by eschewing dance grooves angst and alienation for a folksy sunny pop americana sound frontman drew hermillers uninhibited vocals yip and yelp with an abandon that recalls those early lower east side acid folk bands like the fugs and holy modal rounders who were inventing punk with banjos and kazoos without realizing it hermillers zaniness is leavened by his bandmates who layer well structured harmony vocals synths handclaps and guitars into these pretty if sometimes pretty weird indie pop songs
5536901 im hearing immediate comparisons to sunset rubdown and i like it a solid all around song that i think a lot of you will like
5536902 ma ana ya se cumplen las ocho semanas que m dicamente quer amos esperar as que calculo que s si el t cnico me pone
5536903 no lo s si ser titular daniel guzm n es el que se encarga de todo he trabajado dos semanas muy importantes as que esperemos a ver qu es lo decide si quiere que aporte desde un inicio o prefiere que lo haga en el segundo tiempo pero s o s juego este fin de semana
5536904 hemos trabajado mucho hoy llevamos gracias a dios dos semanas trabajando duro as que creo que no me va a costar mucho tengo muchas ganas y quiero aportarle algo al equipo as que esperemos que el t cnico lo tome de esa manera y l ha visto que he trabajado mucho para estar as y bueno esperemos estar dentro del campo y ayudar un poco a mis compa eros
5536905 creo que con el correr de los partidos vas agarrando ritmo eso es lo principal y tengo que seguir de esa forma todos los d as estoy trabajando un poco en la parte f sica para no sentirlo tanto cuando est en el campo de juego
5536906 thomas ha deseado que el club tenga muchos xitos y asimismo el club le desea a gravessen todo lo mejor en el futuro
5536907 creo que giovani es un buen jugador tanto l como todos lo j venes son grandes jugadores y ahora tiene que demostrar por qu est n en europa yo s que ellos pueden porque han hecho cosas importantes en el extranjero son grandes jugadores y creo que nos van a ayudar much simo
5536908 para m es un sue o estar al lado de cuauht moc blanco desde peque o ustedes como bien saben soy seguidor del am rica l es un dolo para m es un espejo en el cual mirarme a m me gustar a llegar hasta donde ha llegado l y bueno s lo puedo decir de este gran jugador es sin duda uno de los mejores que ha tenido m xico en la historia
5536909 creo que mi trabajo me ha costado tener reconocimiento a mi labor no s si vaya a llegar al mundial o no pero ahorita lo m s importante es conseguir el boleto para el mundial
5536910 la verdad me gust mucho creo que ya estamos volviendo a nuestra forma a la intensidad y a volver a divertirse creo que el equipo se divirti mucho ayer aunque por un error nos empatan pero no importa
5536911 lo importante es c mo retom el equipo las ganas de divertirse jugando al futbol y con una actitud diferente se quitaron la presi n de ganar y de jugar futbol
5536912 creo que nos empatan por lo que deja de hacer chivas y por el gol que les regalamos pero realmente lo que importa es c mo jug chivas y la verdad lo hizo bien
5536913 no para nada hay alg n reproche a su portero creo que todos cometen errores en los partidos en su momento cometi un error olvera antonio y cost un gol pero lo importante es que los corrijan y en el caso de sergio tiene la capacidad de corregir sus errores no creo que err por su juventud sinceramente la pelota ten a un poco de efecto y creo que se equivoc en c mo detenerla es todo pero creo que aprendi la lecci n
5536914 no dio tiempo para reacomodarse estaba listo un cambio y cay el gol en una desatenci n y fue remar en contra de eso
5536915 no fue exceso de confianza m s bien falt leer el partido falt saber qu hacer en ese momento cuando surgi la expulsi n y creo que falt agregarle mayor actitud mayor sacrificio y saber que en casa se deben ganar todos los partidos
5536916 no se puede hablar de eso l nos da opciones en la semana y sabemos a lo que vamos a jugar est quien est en la zona t cnica a final de cuentas quienes jugamos somos los jugadores y quienes decidimos somos los jugadores
5536917 y aunque l estuviera en la banca a lo mejor pasa igual pero m s all est en nosotros somos los responsables y debemos asumir las consecuencias estar concentrados y aprender de todo esto
5536918 tenemos dos salidas complicadas y sabemos que de ah podemos retomar el buen camino o hundirnos para abajo entonces yo creo que m s all de eso somos concientes de que tenemos que ir a sacar puntos lo ideal es sumar seis
5536919 desde media semana ante toluca el equipo mostr una din mica de buen futbol lo hicimos durante una buena parte del partido y eso es importante nunca quieres tener seis puntos de 15 posibles pero creo que el equipo va hacia arriba y eso es importante
5536920 tarde o temprano los resultados deben de llegar ojal lo podamos seguir manteniendo y seguir creciendo esperemos seguir mejorando cada d a para poder que ya ese futbol sea una victoria diferente
5536921 vamos a prepararnos bien para buscar ganar el siguiente partido esa es siempre la idea del equipo
5536922 en las pr ximas elecciones nos jugamos el futuro de la revoluci n
5536923 a aquellos que est n intentando generar ruido de desestabilizar el pa s yo les recomiendo que no se equivoquen esta revoluci n est dispuesta a defenderse y a lanzar las ofensivas que tenga que lanzar
5536924 es muy importante lo que nos estamos jugando en las elecciones del 23 de noviembre se est jugando el futuro de la revoluci n bolivariana ellos vienen por m quieren sacar a ch vez para volver a convertirnos en colonia de los estados unidos
5536925 a hero who also could not stand the pain in his heel
5536926 the best way to comfort and support liu xiang is to continue to watch and support the other olympic competitions
5536927 a modest miracle for the yellow skinned chinese people and the asian people
5536928 liu xiang persisted but he honestly had no way to go on because the injury was right at the point of impact on his foot
5536929 liu xiang our message to you is this we will forever be with you
5536930 since the earthquake the media have seemed to discover the value of the individual and the value of life in communicating with the public
5536931 the public also developed a shared consciousness and a sympathetic response that is different from a simple sense of nationalism
5536932 top chinese athletes do not use ice and do not tape sports nutrition is nowhere on certain levels china is on equal footing with the west and we see that in the gold medal battle but they are not going to reach their full potential until they master sports medicine
5536933 in the u s athletes can train on their own schedules but in china because you are part of the system you train very hard the benefit is that you make rapid progress but your athletic career is shorter in the west an athlete might keep competing into the 30s and 40s but not in china
5536934 liu xiang took us to heaven and now he has taken us to hell
5536935 tengan el plan listo para tomar la polic a de gu rico cuando sea necesario y usted llame al comandante de la polic a y d gale que se atenga a las consecuencias
5536936 al ministro el as jaua tuve que mandarle seguridad especial para que viniera a gu rico porque lo est n amenazando utilizando la polic a de gu rico la ltima vez que vino lo amenazaron le mandaron unos motorizados cuando vinieron a inaugurar el banco agr cola en calabozo
5536937 las polic as de los estados no est n bajo mi control por eso es que en gu rico se ven casos de atropellos policiales
5536938 tenemos que acabar con el latifundio la ley que hizo la revoluci n les da a ustedes la iniciativa de la denuncia h ganlo
5536939 esta actuaci n es muestra del trabajo que hemos realizado con los muchachos que ya a tan temprana edad se enfrentan a competidores de la categor a adulta
5536940 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
5536941 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
5536942 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college

5536944 the democrats talk of tolerance but in reality the only tolerance they ever exhibit is for their own intellectual arrogance and they dont have tolerance for my culture
5536945 they think were a bunch of hillbilly heathens who go out and burn crosses and do crazy bullshit
5536946 they dont give a f if were with them or not because it doesnt matter the f ing republicans have stolen the individual liberties thing and thats why the gun thing is such a big deal
5536947 i got a call from them right after johnny got out i never heard back
5536948 they have to be careful sometimes they remind me of another bunch from chicago the blues brothers they seem to think theyre on a mission from god
5536949 if thats how he runs his campaign he is going to lose id rather bet on those who voted before when he stands up and says that im gonna get 30 per cent more black voters im gonna get 30 per cent more of my people to turn out for me what is joe six pack thinking
5536950 he should say im a black guy im not gonna take the michael jackson treatment but the problems of south side chicago are the same problems of the appalachian mountains big sonsofabitches are kicking the little sonsofabitches in the ass now im one of the little sonsofabitches so im pissed off inside every rural republican is a rural democrat begging to get out but we always trip over our johnsons
5536951 think this election will be won on the internet but here at 5 30 in the afternoon they dont go on the goddamn internet they go watch the andy griffith show a 1960s sitcom
5536952 white people in the south and throughout the appalachians love black culture i mean southern style cooking is black food everything i eat is fried your swing vote in the appalachians comes down to common sense thinking people who have strong faith and what barack obama needs to do is embrace his culture because we like his culture but nobody knows anything about him over 10 per cent of the rednecks out here and im a redneck think hes a muslim cause nobodys ever told em any different
5536953 im pretty sure i aint a queer and ive never had queer thoughts
5536954 but god loves them queers every bit that he loves the republicans
5536955 its their mouth they can use it to haul coal if they want to
5536956 the gallant kids from around here who lost their lives
5536957 it is the same exact people its the same f ing bunch of fight sing drink pray people who are over there who are over here in these mountains
5536958 youre damn right theyre on hadrians side of the wall is where they are and they want the scots irish vote well its true its f ing genes its who we are as a people well say f you to bush longshanks or maggie thatcher f any of em
5536959 bitterly clinging to their religion guns and antithapy towards others
5536960 im here to advocate for sen obama that we get a democrat into the wh
5536961 we had some unexpected issues with sales tax revenue high fuel prices and the hurricane
5536962 i think if we tighten our belts and work together as a city we can overcome that
5536963 as the executive officer of the city its my responsibility to fix whatever problems we have but its hard to anticipate the things weve gone through
5536964 de la rosa has a political vendetta against the city manager
5536965 so far my constituents are asking for accountability at the city management level
5536966 im walking into the meeting with that on my mind
5536967 if this helps anyone out there who is in their middle aged years and has put off what they wanted to do because they thought they were too old or because they have a child and that they cant balance what they want to do with being a parent then thats great what ive done is show them that they can do it
5536968 it was thought that if youre getting to 16 17 or 18 youre getting to the end of your career dara has done a fantastic job in proving that you can continue to improve and that women can have children and get back into the sport she has gotten rid of a mythology in swimming that has been there for so long
5536969 thats an all time high for optical scan usage in this nation
5536970 electronic system usage will go down in 2008 for the first time since we started collecting data in 1980
5536971 we studied these systems and all the systems in use in ohio and the most vulnerable to risk are the touch screen voting machines
5536972 there have been no votes lost just votes that are missed and hours later or days later recovered
5536973 we are in fact in compliance with the terms of the contracts
5536974 if theres a machine failure or a power outage or some kind of misprogramming with the machines it will enable people to keep voting
5536975 what has happened since florida 2000 is weve taken a problem that was a disaster for that election and made it exponentially worse
5536976 these machines cannot be trusted for the counting and recording of our votes
5536977 computer scientists around the country have demonstrated that in less than 60 seconds one of these machines can be broken into and can infect the entire system on which people are voting
5536978 touch screen voting machines have proven to be accurate reliable and secure time and time again
5536979 it is important to note that successful elections necessitate people processes and the technology all working together
5536980 anytime there has been a change in voting equipment there have been some some doubts and concerns which lessen over time due to familiarity with the new equipment
5536981 if all you have is the electronic memory you can reprint that electronic memory as many times as you want its going to say exactly the same thing and you wont know whether its right
5536982 more than a third of the voters in this country will be voting in an unverifiable way
5536983 without an audit without the ability to audit it will be unreliable and without paper record you cant really audit
5536984 this is the central act of democracy it is the basis for the all the legitimacy of our government and its actions we believe or at least want to believe that people are put in office by the will of the voters thats what you need to be able to verify
5536985 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5536986 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5536987 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5536988 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5536989 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5536990 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5536991 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5536992 if i had been here i would not have let them hurt you
5536993 whatever happened to the survival of the fittest i wondered clearwing
5536994 at the school we have students with a variety of profound and multiple disabilities
5536995 with the way digital photography is going its so easy to take a photograph and become an artist
5536996 and with digital you have instant feedback of what youve done and thats quite important for our students
5536997 it meant that we had some cross learning we had students from the mainstream school who needed a little lift who were perhaps at risk of dropping out
5536998 but it also gave our students a chance to develop their social skills and let us give a little bit back to the community
5536999 often special needs schools are seen as the community should always give to them that they are the victims
5537000 but these kids also have great skills and they can give something too
5537001 we like mainstream groups not to look at them as disabled but to recognise their abilities
5537002 theres a focus on nature and buildings in our area looking at things through the students eyes
5537003 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together
5537004 you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
5537005 the last time i checked the vice president is not an independent voice
5537006 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice
5537007 if we had computer love i would let you hack my myspace if my love was a dance you could youtube it
5537008 it is wonderful proclaimed luther how at this moment in history all the arts have come to the light like the art of book printing gods highest and extremest act of grace whereby the business of gospel is driven forward
5537009 the israelis have claimed for years that iranian uranium enrichment efforts are the first steps toward the development of a nuclear weapon a weapon they believe may be used on the jewish state
5537010 i wont accept it because i cant accept it because i dont what else ill do if this fails
5537011 i will fight tooth and nail against anyone who tries to make me accept it because i will be too lost if this doesnt happen
5537012 okay im not going to be president but how about vice president or something so i dont have to face having nothing
5537013 its all real its not a bad dream i am lost and dont feel like doing anything else everybody just leave me alone
5537014 okay i guess i dont have nothing i still have my family i still have people who believed in me i still have a job in the senate i can still make a difference
5537015 my core value and life has been to be of service my daddy did and so have i for most of my adult life i like being an educator on the problems of global warming but i may actually have more leverage to help that and other initiatives as president and besides i will agree if elected to only serve one term where one of my most important roles is to mentor barack obama to be the real president who makes change happen after i leave office in 2012
5537016 christopher doesnt see women for what they should be he sees women for who they can be
5537017 what do you want your look to say to people
5537018 62 of all americans are part of a wireless mobile population that participates in digital activities away from home or work
5537019 gender stereotypes trump race stereotypes in every social science test
5537020 the deal is that women generally fall into two alternatives they are seen as either nice but stupid or smart but mean
5537021 contact doesnt undermine these stereotypes and it might even strengthen them
5537022 many people dont believe seeing women as kind or soft is a stereotype theyre not going to question it because they believe its a good thing
5537023 the measure of a civilization is how it treats those who have hurt it
5537024 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
5537025 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
5537026 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
5537027 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5537028 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5537029 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5537030 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5537031 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5537032 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5537033 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5537034 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5537035 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5537036 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5537037 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5537038 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5537039 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5537040 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5537041 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5537042 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5537043 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5537044 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5537045 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5537046 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5537047 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5537048 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5537049 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5537050 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5537051 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5537052 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5537053 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5537054 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5537055 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5537056 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5537057 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5537058 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
5537059 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5537060 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5537061 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5537062 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5537063 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5537064 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5537065 many in the christian right tend to get their information
5537066 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
5537067 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder
5537068 since man lives by the permission of physical geography it is his fate to be divided by mountains rivers and seas into groups that develop in semi isolation their diverging languages and creeds their climatically conditioned features customs and dress
5537069 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
5537070 the sale will now allow primary to focus on its core business and to progress with the integration of symbions medical centre pathology and radiology businesses dr bateman said
5537071 you know i basically just have met a lot of people with whom i have varying degrees of interest
5537072 what do most guys who go out with you on match think of you
5537073 i just imagine that your average guy on the site just wouldnt know what to do with you youre kind of different
5537074 im not sure whether i was nervous i could have been but the phone is weird and you were mumbling and i was having a hard time hearing you
5537075 ive been on a lot of dates but certainly not 15
5537076 um well im not sure do you think you should see me again
5537077 are you really going to answer my question with another question
5537078 well yeah i mean i think i answered your question already in that i have expressed that i was interested in seeing you so i think that you should do what you think is best for you thats what im doing
5537079 yes look it seems to me that you are looking more for a relationship that that is what you are interested in
5537080 well yeah you basically expressed to me that you wanted more and that you were interested in pursuing me in those terms
5537081 wait you think i want to be in a relationship with you
5537082 um yes that was certainly something you seemed to want
5537083 i never said i wanted to be in a relationship with you
5537084 well first of all you told me you went off match then you asked me if i was seeing anyone else you invited me to things in the future you spoke about traveling with me all of these things imply a more serious relationship
5537085 did i ever say i wanted to be in a relationship with you i never said that i went off match but that doesnt necessarily imply that i wanted a relationship you are saying that
5537086 nf im not exactly sure why we are arguing about this or even what were arguing about at this point all i know is that you seemed to imply that you were interested in the possibility of a relationship
5537087 well you seemed rather sure of yourself before now its the possibility now you are changing your mind
5537088 ok long pause nf i dont want to argue about this anymore im going to make myself some tea im gonna go now i hope you have a great night and i hope to talk to you soon ok
5537089 sorry to interrupt your tea but i just dont want to discontinue interacting with you and i know what your situation is and i respect it and im just gonna say this if you want to see me you have full liberty to see me and i know your whole deal and it would be as you would say it would be lovely to see you so ill leave that up to you so i am therefore putting the ball back in your court and so if you feel like it give me a call im around tomorrow if youre interested we can hang out some more thats cool thats totally cool and its fun and youre fun and i like you so feel free ok take care ciao bye
5537090 t o mandate this contract be given to local companies would have resulted in lesser quality service at a higher cost
5537091 i t also is not fair to increase one citizens taxes to pay for a higher cost contract to subsidize another citizens business who couldnt win the contract in fair open competition like it or not we are in a global marketplace if we subsidize a local company with a portion of its business with a city contract it will still not survive unless it can compete in all its other contracts with private businesses that will insist on the best quality at the best cost
5537092 i cant believe i shaved for this i mean what am i even doing here who cares about bob saget
5537093 i didnt come here to roast bob saget i came here to f ck john stamos
5537094 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
5537095 mama why was meriweather so clumsy i know because the director told her to be right
5537096 they wanted a family that would take care of it and appreciate it
5537097 fortunately we were able to find them and everybody was happy
5537098 im sure they knew about it but it had nothing to do with the sale
5537099 i met the lady who just moved in shes a very nice lady and they have two children
5537100 this is really great when a nice family moves into a neighborhood like this
5537101 cmh remains well positioned to capitalise on the continued growth of subscription television with limited exposure to any potential downturn in advertising markets
5537102 foxtel and premier media group continue to enjoy solid revenue and profit growth from increased subscribers as the penetration of subscription television continues to grow now reaching more than 30 per cent of homes in foxtel areas
5537103 clearly quite tight and are getting tighter as commercial banks pass on their increased borrowing costs to customers
5537104 given there had been a significant change in borrowing behaviour confidence was weaker asset prices had declined and slower overall growth was in prospect tighter financial conditions were not warranted the minutes said
5537105 indeed less restrictive conditions could soon be called for otherwise the risk of a deeper and more persistent slowing in the economy would increase
5537106 on these considerations a case could be made for an early reduction in the cash rate
5537107 scope to move towards a less restrictive setting of monetary policy was judged to be increasing
5537108 given the slower trend in demand scope to move towards a less restrictive setting of monetary policy was judged to be increasing the minutes said
5537109 firstly a lengthy period of inflation above the target was occurring with attendant risk that this would begin to affect wage setting though there was no evidence of this in aggregate wages data to date the minutes said
5537110 if that occurred the cost of reducing inflation later would be greater
5537111 policy had to take account of this risk particularly given both the recent high cpi reading and those in prospect in the near term
5537112 the staff forecast for growth had been revised down slightly while that for inflation was slightly higher in the near term but still saw inflation starting to fall back towards the target during 2009 and 2010 the minutes said
5537113 the staff forecast for growth of the australian economy over the year ahead had been lowered slightly and remained below consensus the minutes said
5537114 it was likely that the headline rate of inflation would rise further in the immediate future but the softer demand outlook meant that inflation was still forecast to decline during 2009 and to be consistent with the target during 2010
5537115 clear evidence of that decline beginning however was unlikely to be seen for a while yet
5537116 the national accounts for the june quarter to be published in early september were likely to show that growth of gdp had been low and the staff forecasts suggested that a weak outcome in the september quarter was also possible the minutes said
5537117 members continued to see considerable uncertainty about the outlook for demand and inflation as the economy remained subject to powerful forces pulling in opposite directions the minutes said
5537118 tighter financial conditions were causing the economy to slow but on the other hand the rise in the terms of trade would continue to add substantially to national income and capacity to spend
5537119 tomorrows table organic farming genetics and the future of food
5537120 the subject matter deals with organic farming methods ge methods questions of environmental conservation risk trust and ownership of seeds and genes the last chapter and the only one written jointly concludes that some marriage of organic and ge technology will represent the agriculture of the future i must admit to holding the same view some 15 years ago but not now i assumed that the use of ge technology would be rather like the green revolution universities and research institutes would make new crop plants available and free to those that needed them what has intervened of course for ge is the input of commercialism which has muddied the waters organic farming is not immune to commercial pressures either and there are strong suspicions that the organic industrys antagonism to ge is a marketing ploy mutated crops induced by radiation for example have been used for many years by conventional and organic farmers alike and it is now known that radiation mutation causes much greater genomic change than ge technology 2
5537121 the continuing conversation did not resolve the issues between them it convinced me however if i needed convincing that while everyone is entitled to their opinions when dealing with detailed technical matters of science or medicine or any subject that requires enormous qualifications and experience the notion that all opinions have equal validity is simply downright wrong if you want real information on the safety of heart surgery procedures do you follow the advice of a qualified heart surgeon or the local butcher if you want advice on flying a jumbo jet do you ask the local bus driver or a pilot with 10 000 hours of experience flying jumbo jets and if you want advice on how to captain a supertanker do you ask a person whose experience is limited to rowing a dinghy mistakes by surgeons are not uncommon 70 of air crashes result from pilot error and occasionally supertankers hit the rocks but relying on rank amateurs instead of professionals would guarantee instant catastrophe many branches of science are very complex however being a scientist isnt enough of course as being a scientist doesnt qualify you to advise on any subject except your specialty to provide advice that can lead to sensible policy requires not only a thorough understanding of the workings and literature of the particular scientific area but many decades of experience in that field
5537122 although ronald and adamchak mention no till agriculture only briefly this is surely the agriculture of the future

5537126 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
5537127 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
5537128 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
5537129 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
5537130 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
5537131 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
5537132 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
5537133 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
5537134 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
5537135 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
5537136 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
5537137 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world

5537144 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
5537145 the problem of maximizing power from sunlight has been known for at least 30 years and is primarily one of physical limitations not engineering technology

5537150 now this is eternal life that they may know you the only true god and jesus christ whom you have sent
5537151 when they saw the courage of peter and john and realized that they were unschooled ordinary men they were astonished and they took note that these men had been with jesus
5537152 i in them and you in me may they be brought to complete unity to let the world know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me
5537153 by this all men will know that you are my disciples if you love one another
5537154 even though you have ten thousand guardians in christ you do not have many fathers for in christ jesus i became your father through the gospel

5537159 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
5537160 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
5537161 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
5537162 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous

5537168 has played a powerful role in policy terms that has supported its continued growth and application for which we should be thankful
5537169 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
5537170 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect

5537175 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
5537176 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
5537177 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
5537178 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
5537179 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
5537180 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
5537181 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
5537182 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
5537183 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
5537184 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
5537185 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
5537186 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
5537187 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
5537188 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border

5537190 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
5537191 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution

5537196 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
5537197 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
5537198 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves

5537207 we believe that these duties are inconsistent with the eus commitments on these products and that they discourage technological innovation in the it sector
5537208 is not something we can negotiate bilaterally with the united states
5537209 in effect the eu is taxing innovation a move that could impair continued technological development in the information technology industry and raise prices for millions of businesses and consumers

5537221 cnn contacted me about this whole thing theyre doing for the election trying to encourage people to vote and they told us they were approaching chris for the project
5537222 im a big fan of his hes got a great voice and i thought it would be a really good idea so i just gave my blessing to the project and they took it from there
5537223 i think people have come to realize what a big mistake the last time theyd voted was it might have been anyway there are two very viable candidates as far as im concerned and there is one who will be a revolutionary candidate in a way and change the direction of america and i think the more people that get out there to vote thats extremely important
5537224 its a song that requires a really strong voice to carry it off and hes got the range and the power to really do it convincingly
5537225 i dont think there are that many singers around at the moment that could really nail it out of all the singers of that style hes the strongest hes just a great singer all around it doesnt matter what style it is he could pretty much sing anything
5537226 i think its not too far away from the original
5537227 theyve modernized it a bit brought it up to todays standards with the sound and arrangement too when i heard it it made me think back to when we recorded the original it was pretty exciting at the time and i sort of got the same feeling when i heard chris version
5537228 five years ago when we were first starting out wed autograph shirts and say start your own band about books
5537229 we just wanted to present a different idea of what a band could be
5537230 we wanted to play music that you wouldnt normally see on the tv or the radio
5537231 we werent thinking we would create a wizard rock movement it just evolved
5537232 but its cool to see bands about books realized in some way
5537233 some people dont like twilight potentially becoming the new harry potter theres a lot of groaning and moaning about the movie coming out and the fact that there is twilight music kind of bothers some people
5537234 twilight is sort of like the hannah montana of literature
5537235 if youre outside the 14 to 16 year old age range you might listen to it and it might get stuck in your head but its not good literature its not really enriching your life the way harry potter might
5537236 love is never going to get old and if you can find new ways to talk about love you can find new ways to write about twilight but i dont think twilight is as powerful as harry potter is twilight is about love and being a teenager and wondering if you fit in and harry potter is that and so much more
5537237 for us its a community not so much a genre of music and i dont know if they have a community yet if they all get together if the bands are as close as all of us are
5537238 i dont think it could have a movement on its own
5537239 but wizard rock can expand to be bands themed about other books it doesnt just have to be about harry potter anyone who is singing about any book can be part of wizard rock

5537242 emis relationship with 30 seconds to mars has been extremely rewarding and successful for both the band and the company
5537243 the hard work of emis global team and of the band has resulted in sales of 3 million albums and singles multiple awards and a growing global fanbase however we have been forced to take procedural legal steps in order to protect emis investment and rights during contract renegotiations initiated by the band and management we hope to resolve these matters amicably and put them behind us so we can continue working in partnership with the band to take them to even greater levels of success
5537244 we had been signed to our record contract for nine years
5537245 basically under california law where we live and signed our deal one cannot be bound to a contract for more than seven years this is widely known by all the record companies and has been for years in fact so aware of it are they that they desperately try to make deals outside of california whenever possible it is a law that protects people from lengthy unfair career spanning contracts this law also gave us the legal right to explore other possible opportunities
5537246 we have been sued by the corporation quite simply because roughly 45 days ago we exercised our legal right to terminate our old out of date contract which according to the law is null and void
5537247 we terminated for a number of reasons which we wont go into here
5537248 the next record we make will be used to pay off that old supposed debt
5537249 so we have lost many of the people that were near and dear to us at virgin emi and crucial to the success of 30 seconds to mars a few of the great ones are still there but it is hardly the same company we have known
5537250 theres other names up there that are just astounding some of our favorite artists and politicians
5537251 but its going to be really cool to see that in 10 years 20 years from now
5537252 a lot of kids feel lonely when they first get diagnosed with diabetes im just so encouraged at the end of the day because all im trying to do is make it through another day managing diabetes

5537255 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
5537256 so youll see a difference in vocals a little bit more personality and its definitely a sensual album
5537257 i definitely think that when i first heard the song from the beginning of the record you kind of feel like you know im leaving it up to you
5537258 and by the time it gets to the second verse and makes it to the end of the song it just feels like im saying i dont want to put up with it anymore
5537259 it was a great first single for me because it said something i fell in love with records like beyonc s irreplaceable where you could emotionally attach yourself to the record as soon as you heard it
5537260 i didnt want something so vague and so clubby because i wanted people to see me as a woman with something to say
5537261 i would say that an official girl is someone in a relationship
5537262 youre attentive youre honest but at the same time you can let go a little bit
5537263 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
5537264 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
5537265 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
5537266 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
5537267 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
5537268 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
5537269 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
5537270 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
5537271 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
5537272 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
5537273 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation

5537302 cmh remains well positioned to capitalise on the continued growth of subscription television with limited exposure to any potential downturn in advertising markets

5537304 clearly quite tight and are getting tighter as commercial banks pass on their increased borrowing costs to customers
5537305 given there had been a significant change in borrowing behaviour confidence was weaker asset prices had declined and slower overall growth was in prospect tighter financial conditions were not warranted the minutes said
5537306 indeed less restrictive conditions could soon be called for otherwise the risk of a deeper and more persistent slowing in the economy would increase
5537307 on these considerations a case could be made for an early reduction in the cash rate
5537308 scope to move towards a less restrictive setting of monetary policy was judged to be increasing
5537309 given the slower trend in demand scope to move towards a less restrictive setting of monetary policy was judged to be increasing the minutes said
5537310 firstly a lengthy period of inflation above the target was occurring with attendant risk that this would begin to affect wage setting though there was no evidence of this in aggregate wages data to date the minutes said
5537311 if that occurred the cost of reducing inflation later would be greater
5537312 policy had to take account of this risk particularly given both the recent high cpi reading and those in prospect in the near term
5537313 the staff forecast for growth had been revised down slightly while that for inflation was slightly higher in the near term but still saw inflation starting to fall back towards the target during 2009 and 2010 the minutes said
5537314 the staff forecast for growth of the australian economy over the year ahead had been lowered slightly and remained below consensus the minutes said
5537315 it was likely that the headline rate of inflation would rise further in the immediate future but the softer demand outlook meant that inflation was still forecast to decline during 2009 and to be consistent with the target during 2010
5537316 clear evidence of that decline beginning however was unlikely to be seen for a while yet
5537317 the national accounts for the june quarter to be published in early september were likely to show that growth of gdp had been low and the staff forecasts suggested that a weak outcome in the september quarter was also possible the minutes said
5537318 members continued to see considerable uncertainty about the outlook for demand and inflation as the economy remained subject to powerful forces pulling in opposite directions the minutes said
5537319 tighter financial conditions were causing the economy to slow but on the other hand the rise in the terms of trade would continue to add substantially to national income and capacity to spend

5537339 the port authority wants to be the best environmental steward of the river it can be

5537383 id have to say that monckton won the debate he came across as more prepared and had answers at his fingertips whereas richard appeared to verbally stumble on occasion
5537384 i got the impression that littlemore was engaging in the debate totally unprepared

5537393 without immediate action hundreds of thousands of people will be displaced by climate change in the coming decades pacific islanders are already affected with their islands very vulnerable to sea level rises storm surge and loss of food security and water supplies
5537394 the pacific islands forum this week is an opportunity to define a more concrete programme of action to assist pacific islanders
5537395 therefore we call on the australian and new zealand governments to recognise the urgency of climate change and the particular threat it poses to the peoples of the pacific
5537396 the australian and new zealand governments must begin a real process of partnership with pacific island countries in finding ways to prepare for and assist with the resettlement of pacific island people who will be displaced by global warming
5537397 low lying island nations such as tuvalu and kiribati are already facing rising seas storms and king tides that are having a terrible impact we could see sea level rises of several metres this century for tuvalu which has an average height of less than two metres that is a disaster
5537398 the pacific island leadership forum is an opportunity to work with pacific island countries on a plan to assist with large scale displacement australia and new zealand cannot sit on its hands and wait for the disaster to come now is the time for action
5537399 taking action on climate change for the pacific is obviously something that the pacific island nations cant do themselves they havent been responsible for emissions that have caused this problem and they dont have the capacity to be able to defend themselves against climate change
5537400 there are three key things first to reduce emissions to meet kyoto protocol obligations and without having to buy offsets of international emissions second they need to carry the message that there should be binding targets at the international level through the united nations negotiations and be prepared to sign up themselves to reduce emissions by at least 13 per cent by the year 2020 and thirdly australia and new zealand really need to support pacific island countries with money and technology for defending themselves against climate change impacts which are already happening in the pacific

5537409 the bat thinkaboutit and mister t have apparently been living on the moon for a while and have been out of touch with events here on earth the fact that john mccain was fooling around with cindy while he was still married to carol is something that he admits

5537444 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5537445 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5537446 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5537447 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5537448 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5537449 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5537450 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5537451 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5537452 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5537453 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5537454 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5537455 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5537456 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice

5537488 according to businessweek the solution to the iphone 3gs chipset issues could be easier than most of us probably expected apparently apple set up the infineon chip to demand more of a 3g signal than was necessary which resulted in a switch back to the slower network if there are too many people in the area using an iphone at the same time this involves an issue with software on the chip which can probably be remedied through an upgrade instead of a costly and annoying recall businessweek claims that apple and chip maker infineon are hard at work on the fix and it could be released as early as the end of this month businessweek via cnet

5537490 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
5537491 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values

5537576 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama

5537578 a lot of our customers like the ubuntu desktop and use it for software development now they want to roll it out to the server we want to make sure that when they roll out ubuntu on the server they find it equally joyous
5537579 we want to make it as easy to install software on the ubuntu server as it is to for example were getting ready to release db2 and informix database management systems that come as deb packages which will install and do basic set up with only a couple of clicks or a single command line instruction

5537582 we see ubuntu part of a larger trend toward fragmentation of the linux marke
5537583 linux itself isnt fragmenting but we see other companies besides red hat and novell moving up with canonical being so hot on the desktop and pushing hard on the server we think the desktop will work in their favor
5537584 perhaps canonical could jump over servers i could see a cloud vendor approaching ubuntu
5537585 the iranian development and testing of rockets is troubling and raises further questions about their intentions
5537586 this action and dual use possibilities for their ballistic missile program have been a subject of iaea discussions and are inconsistent with their un security council obligations
5537587 it is clear that for years iran has had shihab 3 ballistic missiles which put israel within its reach but the threat posed by iran comes from its nuclear program and not from its satellites or ballistic missiles
5537588 iranian experts can put the national satellite into orbit in the not too distant future
5537589 the other way hasnt worked around here for the last five years
5537590 youve got to be willing to release em and live with it and pick other people up for more competition
5537591 when you take this job you realize who the owner is and you realize most guys dont last really long so that is what it is
5537592 hes got a lot to prove now with that contract
5537593 its been a situation that unfortunately we havent brought guys in i control what i can control we come out every day and get our guys as good as we can im pleased with the top of our roster but we need to add to the bottom of our roster we need more competition
5537594 i really dont have anybody to look at thats the problem there isnt anybody there thats very dynamic with the ball
5537595 thats discouraging because he was paid an awful lot of money paid like one of the top five receivers in the nfl we need him to make those plays
5537596 i am disappointed that fiji is absent from the forum because it means a disengagement from dialogue
5537597 i see it this way those in opposition to us have so little in their favor in terms of evidence for maintaining their heart clogging global warming enhancing death mongering lifestyle that they now need to vilify us to make themselves feel better it is becoming ever more alarming how similar war mongers are to meat mongers
5537598 if you are doing ajax development there is one library that you absolutely need to know direct web remoting dwr this gos 3 beta netbooks and linux an interview with david liu fo

5537604 people from all minority communities do have experience of getting on with people who are different and of fitting in
5537605 they are also good at doing these things in a way that is not conspicuous
5537606 they the patriots cheated there should be an asterisk they cheated and they got caught why if you have nothing to hide would you destroy the evidence thats how ive looked at it from the beginning why destroy something that doesnt have to be destroyed let everyone know what was on the tapes why would you destroy them so fast
5537607 most parents report that their work hours and private commitment fit very well or fairly well
5537608 i had never had any desire to do a film where i take my clothes off and do explicit sex scenes
5537609 in fact i thought that that would never happen there was no chance in hell
5537610 once i read the script it rang so truthful for me and after speaking to clement and tamara and eric and damon doliveira the producer i heard their vision for the film and how they did want to make it very truthful and not just be your typical hollywood love scene
5537611 so it was the opportunity to tell this beautiful story in a really truthful way you know
5537612 its a very odd thing to me that violence is completely okay and children go see sin city but you get a film like lie with me or y tu mama tambien and people freak out
5537613 its exhilarating its as scary as hell its very odd its very bizarre clement and eric and i had several rehearsals and meetings where we sat down and came to the conclusion that we were going to dive into this and make it truthful and we were not going to lie within the boundaries that we had set up between the three of us
5537614 i cant because we made a pact but the three of us figured out what we were comfortable with and then it was just the three of us going for it
5537615 clement was very specific with the blocking the choreography of each scene but after that we were pretty free to go for it and go for it we did
5537616 this is bill beelicheck head coach of the new england patriots hes won three super bowls how he cheated he even got caught cheating and nobody cared he proved that in america its alright to cheat as long as you cheat your way to the top

5537623 estos son los partidos que me gustan jugar es una alegr a que se haya clasificado argentina porque jugar estos cl sicos me encanta
5537624 ambos equipos nos tenemos mucho respeto ser un partido interesante

5537641 todas las buenas perspectivas se tendr n que demostrar en la pista porque tanto en la liga acb como en la euroliga hay buenos equipos que te pueden complicar la vida

5537688 certainly now what we want to see in pakistan is a period of political stability to enable the government and the parliament of pakistan to address the serious issues that pakistan faces including security issues
5537689 they have very direct consequences for the nearly thousand troops that we have in afghanistan abutting the afghanistan pakistan border
5537690 a great deal still depends on the decisions and good judgment of the next president the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent senator obama
5537691 we won a massive victory in a few weeks and we did so with very limited loss of american and allied lives we were able to end aggression with minimum overall loss of life and we were even able to greatly reduce the civilian casualties of afghani and iraqi citizens
5537692 well then why was there a banner that said mission accomplished on the aircraft carrier look the i have said a long time that reconstruction of iraq would be a long long difficult process but the conflict the major conflict is over the regime change has been accomplished and its very appropriate
5537693 senator obama commits the greater error of insisting that even in hindsight he would oppose the surge even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5537694 i suppose from my opponents vantage point veterans concerns are just one more issue to be spun or worked to advantage this would explain why he has also taken liberties with my position on the gi bill as a political proposition it would have much easier for me to have just signed on to what i considered flawed legislation but the people of arizona and of all america expect more from their representatives than that and instead i sought a better bill im proud to say that the result is a law that better serves our military better serves military families and better serves the interests of our country
5537695 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
5537696 whats less apparent is the judgment to be commander in chief and in matters of national security good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president as we were all reminded ten days ago by events in the nation of georgia
5537697 mccain may not have been in the cone of silence
5537698 may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5537699 the fact is that during senator obamas segment at saddleback last night senator mccain was in a motorcade to the event and then held in a green room with no broadcast feed
5537700 one may use the radio a cellphone a blackberry bluetooth wireless a slingbox and perhaps a satellite tv feed whether mccain actually used any of those devices we have no idea but he absolutely had the ability to use them which is all that mitchell had reported
5537701 this is irresponsible journalism and sadly indicative of the level of objectivity we have witnessed at nbc news this election cycle
5537702 we are concerned that your news division is following msnbcs lead in abandoning non partisan coverage of the presidential race we would like to request a meeting with you as soon as possible to discuss our deep concerns about the news standards and level of objectivity at nbc
5537703 never use the words calumny persiflage and dyspeptic in the same sentence
5537704 and john mccain pulls off a slim upset victory over barack hussein obama
5537705 it was only the individual silver medal that came with a chain
5537706 we are looking very carefully at the senate inquiry in relation to a number of these measures announced in the budget
5537707 ive already announced we will be opposing the tax on ready to drinks the so called alcopops
5537708 well be opposing the medicare surcharge changes the changes to income streaming for the commonwealth seniors health card and were looking very closely at the luxury car tax and the consequences for the tourism sector for large families and the australian car industry
5537709 the government did not announce prior to the election that it was going to increase taxes by 19 5 billion if were fighting inflation why is the government adding 20 billion in tax increases
5537710 were having a look at the condensate tax issue the governments done a drive by tax shooting on woodside 2 5 billion over the four years we want to make absolutely certain that there will be no impact domestically on australians as a result of that tax increase
5537711 im looking at a range of initiatives of things we meaningfully can do to take on alcohol not only for young people but across the board
5537712 young people are being stereotyped in part by the attacks on ready to drinks but the evidence that alcopops are the source of binge drinking by people does not support the assertions that have been made by the prime minister nor the health minister
5537713 while the consumption of ready to drinks alcopops has increased over the last seven years the at risk young drinkers are actually consuming fewer alcopops in a drinking session than they have been in the past
5537714 well take over the cement plants at midnight because the deadline has come and theyll become state property
5537715 it was not possible to arrive at an agreement with them cemex and the next step that we must take is to proceed with expropriation
5537716 asking a price way above the real price they were asking for more than 1 2 billion us dollars
5537717 so tomorrow well go ahead with nationalizing and regaining the cement industries
5537718 while im in power with your help and gods venezuela will march down the road of equality social justice and socialism

5537738 they attack us because weve been over there weve been bombing iraq for 10 years
5537739 i thought mr paul captured it the other night exactly correctly this war is dangerous to america because its based not on gender equality as mr giuliani suggested or any other kind of freedom but simply because of what we do in the islamic world because were over there basically as mr paul said in the debate
5537740 imperial hubris why the west is losing the war on terror
5537741 his genius lies in his ability to isolate a few american policies that are widely hated across the muslim world and that growing hatred is going to yield growing violence
5537742 our leaders continue to say that were making strong headway against this problem and i think we are not
5537743 the uniqueness of the unit was more or less that it was focused on a single individual it was really the first time the agency had done that sort of effort
5537744 where he was where his cells were where his logistical channels were
5537745 how he communicated who his allies were who donated to them i think its fair to say the entire range of sources were brought to bear
5537746 we had found that he and al qaeda were involved in an extraordinarily sophisticated and professional effort to acquire weapons of mass destruction in this case nuclear material so by the end of 1996 it was clear that this was an organization unlike any other one we had ever seen
5537747 and if we could have got osama bin laden and saved at some point down the road 3 000 american lives a few less arab princes would have been ok in my book
5537748 you couldnt have done this without killing an arab prince
5537749 probably not sister virginia used to say youll be known by the company you keep that if those princes were out there eating goat with osama bin laden then maybe they were there for nefarious reasons but nonetheless they would have been the price of battle
5537750 my understanding is you had a reputation within the cia as being fairly obsessive about this subject
5537751 i think i became too insistent that we were not pursuing this target with enough vigor and with enough risk taking an unwillingness to take risks
5537752 i got relieved of the position i was in i had a lovely sojourn in the library and then had other sojourns since
5537753 the war in iraq if osama was a christian its the christmas present he never would have expected
5537754 no one wants to abandon the israelis but i think the perception is and i think its probably an accurate perception that the tail is leading the dog that we are giving the israelis carte blanche ability to exercise whatever they want to do in their area
5537755 and if thats what the american people want then thats what the policy should be of course but the idea that anything in the united states is too sensitive to discuss or too dangerous to discuss is really i think absurd
5537756 im not talking about appeasement theres no way out of this war at the moment
5537757 its not a choice between war and peace its a choice between war and endless war its not appeasement i think its better even to call it american self interest
5537758 bin ladens still at large his most recent speech i think demonstrates that hes not running rock to rock cave to cave we are tangled in a very significant islamic insurgency in iraq
5537759 most dramatically and perhaps least noticed is the violence inside saudi arabia itself saudi arabia was until just a few years ago probably one of the most safe countries on earth and now the paper is daily full of activities and shootouts between islamists who supported osama bin laden and the government there
5537760 one of the great intellectual failures of the american intelligence community and especially the counterterrorism community is to assume if someone hasnt attacked us its because he cant or because weve defeated him
5537761 bin laden has consistently shown himself to be immune to outside pressure when he wants to do something he does it on his own schedule
5537762 youve written no one should be surprised when osama bin laden and al qaeda detonate a weapon of mass destruction in the united states
5537763 i dont believe in inevitability but i think its pretty close to being inevitable
5537764 a nuclear weapon of some dimension whether its actually a nuclear weapon or a dirty bomb or some kind of radiological device
5537765 hes told us it bin laden is remarkably eager for americans to know why he doesnt like us what he intends to do about it and then following up and doing something about it in terms of military actions
5537766 hes told us that we are going to acquire a weapon of mass destruction and if we acquire it we will use it
5537767 he secured from a saudi sheik named hamid bin fahd a rather long treatise on the possibility of using nuclear weapons against the americans specifically nuclear weapons
5537768 and the treatise found that he was perfectly within his rights to use them muslims argue that the united states is responsible for millions of dead muslims around the world so reciprocity would mean you could kill millions of americans
5537769 and thats another thing that doesnt come to the attention of the american people
5537770 richard clarke has said that youre really sort of a hothead a middle manager who really didnt go to any of the cabinet meetings in which important things were discussed and that basically you were just uninformed
5537771 i certainly agree with the fact that i didnt go to the cabinet meetings but im certainly also aware that im much better informed than mr clarke ever was about the nature of the intelligence that was available again osama bin laden and which was consistently denigrated by himself and mr tenet
5537772 i think mr clarke had a tendency to interfere too much with the activities of the cia and our leadership at the senior level let him interfere too much
5537773 so criticism from him i kind of wear as a badge of honor
5537774 yeah i think there is i think our leaders over the last decade have done the american people a disservice in continuing to characterize osama bin laden as a thug as a gangster as a degenerate personality as some kind of abhorrent individual
5537775 he surely does reprehensible activities and we should surely take care of that by killing him as soon as we can but hes not an irrational man hes a very worthy enemy hes an enemy to worry about
5537776 you wrote in your book that hes a great man
5537777 yes certainly a man without the connotation good or bad hes a great man in the sense that hes influenced the course of history
5537778 until we respect him we are going to die in numbers that are probably unnecessary
5537779 i was talking to the national security adviser and the president and the vice president every day
5537780 i certainly didnt get a sense that anybody was not paying attention to what i was doing and what i was briefing and what my concerns were and what we were trying to do
5537781 we could never get over the critical hurdle of being able to corroborate bin ladins whereabouts
5537782 a serious consideration of the implications of a u s invasion
5537783 the threat that the u s and israel face from the islamic republic of iran is today greater than ever
5537784 we israel are benefiting from one thing and that is the attack on the twin towers and the pentagon and the american struggle in iraq
5537785 the duty of americans to support an island of democracy in the middle east
5537786 threatens the security of the united states and its allies worldwide thats because jerusalem and israel are ground zero in the global battle between tyranny and democracy radicalism and moderation terrorism and freedom
5537787 the rabbis say in the talmud that a lot of rabbinic law is to put a fence around the torah so you dont get near to violating it well mccain has a series of very clear headed policies toward terrorism and islamic extremism that put extra layers behind his support for israel
5537788 jerusalem is not merely the capital of israel but the spiritual capital of jews and christians everywhere its the site of the first and second temples which housed the holy of holies and its the direction in which we jews face when we pray this glorious city of david is bound to the jewish people by an undeniable 3 000 year historical link
5537789 the jealousy of a free people ought to be constantly awake since history and experience prove that foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government

5537794 mr mccain the economic disaster is happening right now maybe you havent noticed
5537795 they dont have something positive to say about what theyre going to do for america what they try to do is they say well this other guy hes unpatriotic or this other guy he likes french people thats what they said about kerry
5537796 after being upstaged at the saddleback compassion forum barack obama has adjusted his stump remarks into a hysterical litany of political attacks

5537822 ive been performing since i was three i have training in every aspect so for me to be compared with someone who sounds like they just began singing thats not really fair
5537823 i didnt come here to learn i just think i know more its that simple

5537831 we thought our music was going to land on the shelves with the dirty comedy albums
5537832 when i was 16 if someone asked me what kind of career and life i wanted to have i would have shortchanged myself if i wrote it out then it wouldnt have come close to the reality there was no template then no way to picture where hip hop was going to go
5537833 i think about going to audio achievements at the end of van ness right there in torrance thats where we recorded it was a textbook 80s studio the wood paneling on the walls it was cold in there too we were used to working out of the garage man where it was sweaty and muggy we were in jackets and our teeth are chattering
5537834 you can hear the frustration with the situation we tried to have fun with it but the music was reflecting what was going on in the neighborhood living in the 1980s just trying to get by day by day in places where crack was huge and the police were crazy
5537835 then the rodney king thing happened a few years later and then all over the world people looked and said hey those guys from compton were right
5537836 do you like everything you made when you were 17
5537837 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5537838 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5537839 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5537840 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5537841 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5537842 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5537843 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5537844 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5537845 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5537846 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5537847 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5537848 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5537849 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5537850 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5537851 i guess this is about burning and stabbing my wife
5537852 at the time of her highness birthday a messenger would call all the ladies would go to the palace

5537854 i would welcome participating in a paternity test be happy to participate in one happy to take a paternity test and would love to see it happen
5537855 one of the hardest things for teachers to do is to imagine the fear that students feel as they try to learn what we teach its easy to forget the fears and terrors new learning can provoke feelings of fright embarrassment and intimidation
5537856 try new learning experiences that are difficult and use the experience to gain an appreciation of terrors and anxieties our own students are facing this will give you empathy towards students blockages and anxieties

5537864 it is in your own interest to distance yourself from these criminals this is an ultimatum dont complain tomorrow
5537865 a pre emptive strike similar to the 1981 attack ordered by then prime minister menachem begin that destroyed an unfinished iraqi nuclear reactor
5537866 i will continue the tradition established by menachem begin who did not allow iraq to develop such a nuclear threat against israel and by a daring and courageous act gave us two decades of tranquility
5537867 i believe that this is what israel has to do

5537878 think of his fund raising event as being like an ipo an initial public offering he said we should get in early because then it doesnt cost as much the longer you wait to get in he said the more it will cost you and if you dont get in at all then it will be painful after november after the democrats win the majority

5537881 reporters are grumbling more and more that the campaign is acting like the prom queen they gripe that it is arrogant and control ling and the campaigns own belief that obama is poised to make history isnt endearing either the press certainly helped obama get so far so fast the question is how far can he get if his campaign alienates them
5537882 end of the affair barack obama and the press break up
5537883 the problem is not that democrats are monolithically pro choice or anti school prayer its that by dropping the class language that once distinguished them sharply from republicans they have left themselves vulnerable to cultural wedge issues like guns and abortion and the rest whose hallucinatory appeal would ordinarily be overshadowed by material concerns we are in an environment where republicans talks constantly about class in a coded way to be sure but where democrats are afraid to bring it up
5537884 since i run a small computer repair business of my own i have a handful of guys working with me and i always stress to them that i want happy customers first through decent work and second by never making the customer feel stupid even if the customer made a mistake or did something stupid
5537885 although i like to think im practicing a little buddhist or socialist right livelihood here its also sound capitalism since happy customers not only come back they tell other people that your work was good and you treated them well and so they bring you more customers
5537886 we print critiques of obama all the time and dont have to go into your hyperbole
5537887 he really impresses me said barry zito who threw seven shutout innings in tandem with sandoval
5537888 bengie molina was working with him between innings helping him with stuff i mean i threw my game i shook him a few times but he started to get a feel for it
5537889 he was better balanced and called a great game bochy said
5537890 today he didnt miss a beat he didnt miss any of my signs he has good game awareness and brings a lot of energy
5537891 hes fired up yelling hes got a real passion for

5537897 we regret that formal consultations have not been successful in resolving our concerns over the duties that the eu is imposing on several high tech products

5537899 is not something we can negotiate bilaterally with the united states

5537901 although people have been charged there is still a lot of work to do and other lines of inquiry that need to be followed up
5537902 the investigators have made a significant stride and hopefully this dreadful case is coming to its conclusion
5537903 all i will say is that my client maintains his innocence
5537904 we were informed this morning of the news from antigua and we are pleased at how the investigation is progressing
5537905 if you remove a school bus from the road youre adding 40 to 50 cars in the morning and in the afternoon
5537906 our goal was to keep those cuts as far away from the classroom as possible
5537907 what if fuel should go up by a quarter in a period of a month or two
5537908 we might have to have some emergency response to that
5537909 are you going to walk a half mile down the street to cross in the appropriate way when you see a clear way right there
5537910 i dont really like it because it takes like 20 minutes to do it
5537911 when its a panic call theyre not thinking it through in that way
5537912 we are not spending more on fuel this year because were driving less
5537913 yeah i make these every time they serve this meal
5537914 ive been to moncton and i normally do nova scotia and pei but this is the most
5537915 any laws against operating a small office from an apartment in the act
5537916 we have to deny russian strategic objectives which are clearly to undermine georgias democracy to use its military capability to damage and in some cases destroy georgian infrastructure and to try and weaken the georgian state
5537917 we are not going to allow russia to draw a new line at those states that are not yet integrated into the trans atlantic structures
5537918 to clearly indicate that we are not accepting a new line
5537919 is a very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
5537920 this is not something that is just cost free nobody needs russian strategic aviation along americas coast
5537921 an explanation from the russians for why the russian president either wont or cant keep his word
5537922 it didnt take that long for the russian forces to get in and it really shouldnt take that long for them to get out
5537923 there seems to be complete market failure as our subscribers are denied advanced value added services in contrast to world scenario where such internet based services are very popular
5537924 customers will ultimately benefit from cost effective and innovative internet telephony service
5537925 medida que o mundo passa de predominantemente rural para mais urbano as cidades utilizam mais e mais gua para agricultura

5537927 may i suggest if there are five blokes to every girl we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa
5537928 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face
5537929 whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
5537930 two women came in and said weve got to get rid of this drongo i said id be happy to help
5537931 its horrifying that a public figure would say such things what era is he living in
5537932 hes just letting people know its good fun to be a woman in mount isa
5537933 were all rednecks up here we dont carry it around as a badge of shame we carry it around as a badge of honour
5537934 creates pressure on hamas and is likely to accelerate the negotiations over gilad shalit
5537935 the gesture will not make hamas more flexible about its demands because the organization sees that israel is releasing prisoners with blood on their hands which merely causes hamas to harden its position
5537936 hamas is looking despairingly at how despite the fact that it holds shalit it is not succeeding in bringing about a prisoner release while abu mazen abbas who is conducting negotiations with israel is securing a prisoner release
5537937 its enough to see hamas response to the governments decision to understand the pressure the organization is under
5537938 a prisoner release is not interpreted as a gesture but as weakness
5537939 releasing prisoners as a gesture does not attest to weakness but to strength
5537940 prisoner exchange deals attest to weakness far more than does a move made in a manner and at a time convenient to us with the goal of strengthening moderate elements in the palestinian authority
5537941 we would probably wait and see what ukraines response is what the eu u s and natos response is then we would try to draw up a new balance sheet which takes these things into consideration
5537942 they are destroying everything and then pulling out of these places
5537943 if they call this a pullout then i do not understand the meaning of the word
5537944 the georgian side put forward a number of additional demands at the last minute effectively spoiling the whole idea
5537945 negotiations on this issue are under way we had no agreement to exchange prisoners today
5537946 we regret that formal consultations have not been successful in resolving our concerns over the duties that the eu is imposing on several high tech products
5537947 we believe that these duties are inconsistent with the eus commitments on these products and that they discourage technological innovation in the it sector
5537948 is not something we can negotiate bilaterally with the united states
5537949 in effect the eu is taxing innovation a move that could impair continued technological development in the information technology industry and raise prices for millions of businesses and consumers
5537950 there are two kinds of people those who set about looking for themselves and those who go in search of the fantastic i am of the former i search endlessly through history literature religion music searching for my own thoughts and emotions articulated elsewhere in another era another mind so as not to feel lonely to validate my own sort of existence or just because the reduplication of my soul makes me smile
5537951 very very proud of these guys that was our biggest fear after the first game a 5 1 loss to south lake charles la that playing our three or four games back here or whatever we get to play that we wanted to show everybody what we were capable of doing
5537952 when i hit my first home run i knew i was down two strikes
5537953 weve been waiting for him and he finally got a hold of one and it happened to be here in williamsport
5537954 they didnt swing at too many bad pitches i think that was the key obviously maryland they threw a lot of offspeed at us a lot of different guys at us a lot of different looks
5537955 as a child i questioned why the new year started in autumn and not spring when things are being born when it seems that beginnings are all around and it owuld be most
5537956 take her round for another pass the mustang is escaping along that ridge we can cut her off at the pass
5537957 failing to bargain realistically and remove unattainable items from the table
5537958 you cant have a plan that just says were holding secret meetings and our question is just what the hell does that mean
5537959 the version of the story that is on the brooklyn paper web site is accurate and fair in every detail a clarification will appear in our aug 23 print version to explain two minor problems with the print version that was published on aug 16
5537960 to be honest if that post was even slightly coherent we would
5537961 for us its a first small step into an experiment and actually a pretty big experiment as were potentially accepting
5537962 on a slightly more philosophical level its a never ending process
5537963 right thats in all borders between places have been decided
5537964 oh no that photo wasnt taken in such and such but actually here
5537965 the men are going through what women went through when breast cancer wasnt talked about as much as it is today
5537966 i wanted to help put men at ease which i can do by talking about my experience with cancer
5537967 most men who call us are confused about what they want to do so we talk about what weve experienced and if the men want to get information about another method they can talk to someone else whos had that experience
5537968 people like to talk to us because we understand the rollercoaster of emotions when you first hear the diagnosis from your doctor some people talk to us before theyve told their families
5537969 and a lot of men are worried about their sex life when they hear they have prostate cancer
5537970 it takes all the running you can do to keep in the same place
5537971 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5537972 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5537973 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5537974 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5537975 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5537976 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5537977 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5537978 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5537979 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5537980 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5537981 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5537982 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5537983 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5537984 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5537985 the idiom toe the line from an athletics analogy originated in the early 19th century
5537986 i think everyone has to find a way to the middle i dont think posting black lists is right nor do i think badgering bloggers is right
5537987 be genuine think openly write down any and all ideas keep an open mind and be respectful of other peoples thoughts ideas and opinions
5537988 bloggers need to be clear about their preferences for companies that want to share information
5537989 i promise not to spam you and will treat you with respect
5537990 on how to get the same treatment as the ceos family in any hospital a book on patient advocacy
5537991 however we have to define blogger relations to me it has two meanings 1 the pitching part in media relations but to bloggers 2 having a dialogue with a blogger without the intent of pitching something but to share ideas and discussion
5537992 blogger relations sounds so pr ish i think that if companies are considering just blogger relations that they will get short changed on what the social media induced changes can deliver to their overall business and marketing
5537993 doing it right is engaging in meaningful conversations in a transparent fashion with an involved target audience
5537994 i think comcastcares is doing it right on twitter by participating in the conversation and being responsive
5537995 ive been reading your blog and followed by boilerplate 3 promoting products and services clearly unrelated to the blogs topic intent or audience 4 continuing to email after having been told the blogger is not interested anonymous
5537996 unsuccessful blogger relations all have one thing in common which is that they are one sided and offer little value to the bloggers and therefore come off as nothing more than spam anonymous
5537997 consumers are creating your commercials its part of this brave new world we live in
5537998 the challenge is figuring out how all these things can be practical
5537999 the reason we are tapping influential bloggers like yourself is because
5538000 nbsp the number of new corporate blogs among the companies forrester tracks has dropped from 36 in 2006 to just three in 2008
5538001 social building relationships that encouraging learning from each other and together that might be friend to friend or customer to brand manager
5538002 dispirited unmotivated underappreciated workers cannot compete in a highly competitive world
5538003 do we want to talk to people differently from how we did in the past
5538004 when i was first seriously studying art as an undergraduate at indiana university painting its history and process was the flotsam and jetsam through which i approached my understanding of art this is a murky water indeed to wade through to see art
5538005 i think there is a fair chance perth will be the 21st centurys first ghost metropolis
5538006 i have been using turbulence training for about 3 months now and am ecstatic with the results the workouts require minimal equipment you get great nutrition information and you get access to the online forum which is invaluable being able to actually communicate on almost a daily basis with the person who created the program is one of the best parts of tt and there are plenty of other people on the site with tons of useful information who may have gone through similar experiences since starting the tt program i have dropped 15 lbs more than 5 bodyfat and over 3

5538020 during a photo session where the spanish national team was unveiled one of our sponsors asked us to pose with a wink to our participation in beijing and we made an oriental expression with our eyes
5538021 it seemed to us to be something appropriate and that it would always be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
5538022 i want to express that we have great respect for the orient and its people some of my best friends in toronto are of chinese origin
5538023 even though the chinese community has a long history of settlement in spain the spanish population still considers the chinese as a closed and somewhat mysterious community references to exaggerated stereotypes and prejudices regarding their activities and social organization can often be overheard in daily conversations

5538025 enterprises are used to having everything managed and monitored with feedback and audits but this just doesnt exist in storage despite its growth
5538026 many organisations dont know how much capacity they have so they keep throwing boxes into their storage which is cheap but causes thermal problems in data centres and impacts things like recovery times and tape backups
5538027 the management tools methodology and experts method just havent been available
5538028 its easier to sell bucket loads of terabytes and worry about storage later
5538029 i see businesses with a lot of storage distributed across their datacentres in very distributed environments that are throwing terabytes at the problem and might not have the right staff and processes
5538030 one way to solve the problem is to give it away but thats not what many organisations want they could benefit greatly from getting experienced staff in or have a third party help them part time or remotely

5538051 islamic community in serbia has deemed it offensive to muslims
5538052 the jewel of medina was to be published in the united states last month but the publisher there decided against selling the book fearful of the reaction of radical muslims

5538067 theyre a collection of stores that operate under one roof but usually each has its own clients stores open and close all the time just as lobbyists move around quite regularly and they both tend to take their clients with them
5538068 nonprofit lobbyists have been involved in nearly every major public policy accomplishment in this country from civil rights to environmental protection to health care
5538069 tens of thousands of lives have been saved by passing laws that improve car safety and reduce drunk driving
5538070 the expectations of our clients are such that we have to have a full range of political policy and business expertise and in todays world that includes democrats
5538071 our firm is big and multifaceted and we have to change with the town not just in terms of politics but also with our business offerings
5538072 a lot of what we do is business to business relationships and international policy disputes
5538073 you get to know the family and you find out what these young men are made of
5538074 when everything else is equal their makeup is often what decides whether you draft them or not
5538075 the colleges pitch their no 1 starters on friday nights and a lot of the high schools do too
5538076 the tournaments are good places to see a lot of good ones jonathan played in a state all star game at mercer university in macon he knocked one into some trees behind the fence that day he could run too
5538077 i remember there were 75 scouts at the first game i pitched my senior year
5538078 i think it made my catcher nervous though the first pitch he caught he threw it back over my head
5538079 i never liked it that much i told them i wasnt going to play in high school finally they asked me to come out and be the kicker and i agreed
5538080 then after a couple of games they told me to go into the line i reminded them of what they said and then i left
5538081 they took me out of t ball when i was 6 and from then on i was out there with older players i started pitching when i was 9 i always could throw it pretty hard but that never really impressed me as much as putting it where i wanted
5538082 my bullpen coach last year dan warthen was real good he said theres no use in going out and throwing in the high 90s when its just going to wear my arm out and its not as easy to command he showed me how to throw in the low to mid 90s and get ahead and then when i really need it i can find some more velocity it doesnt mean much if you cant put it where you want to thats why i dont pay attention to those gun readings
5538083 it undercuts his credibility as a critic of sec enforcement and regulation
5538084 that i serve on corporate boards gives me a better understanding of what goes on in a boardroom
5538085 the better you understand something the better you can figure out how to deal with it
5538086 treasury could have one meeting with all of us rather than have separate meetings a simple one stop
5538087 treasury was looking to put together private sector allies to tell real life stories
5538088 were certainly glad to see his group saying the same thing we are
5538089 mary lambert contacted wal mart and wanted to know if we might be interested in helping to underwrite the documentary
5538090 we thought it would be a great opportunity to help highlight the contributions that women have made in u s history and particularly in the u s senate
5538091 the best policy comes when you have to make some compromises
5538092 make the case why government should step up and fund more generously programs that have a direct impact on saving millions of lives
5538093 the foundations resources alone arent enough to fill that gap
5538094 well be putting out research developing messages and doing a lot of media and communications outreach in washington and other parts of the country
5538095 our hope is to convince the public opinion leaders and policymakers that this is a good thing to do
5538096 to increase and improve funding for research on malaria tuberculosis hiv aids and other tropical diseases prevalent in developing countries
5538097 the aftermarket repair industry has not been given all the information it needs to make repairs
5538098 they both have as a purpose to insulate policymakers from ordinary citizens and citizen groups in order to enhance the influence of certain inside the beltway elites
5538099 we believe this bill poses a tremendous threat to any american who wants to communicate with a member of the executive branch
5538100 the burdens of this bill are onerous on government officials and intimidating to the public
5538101 its not a burdensome reporting requirement and it is important information for the public to know
5538102 waxman wants to sell his bill as an expansion of government in the sunshine but its really a tanning salon a structure in which executive branch officials would be isolated from the real world and then exposed to intense artificial and unhealthy radiation generated by privileged inside players such as himself
5538103 this is not the last time that they or any of my government accounts have been late

5538124 citizens would be understandably upset if they knew that letters they sent through the u s post office were never delivered
5538125 unfortunately there is strong evidence that much of the electronic mail that citizens assume is reaching congress is ending up in an electronic trash can
5538126 theres a lot of resentment toward us on capitol hill
5538127 a lot of issue advertising turns out to be very expensive memos to congress or the administration
5538128 and its hard to quantify if its reaching its target audience and whether its effective

5538130 the two of them have been very effective working together representing the securities industry and i think theyll be even more effective now
5538131 by forming this new organization this sector of the financial services industry will speak with a single shared voice and their influence in policymaking can only grow

5538137 and so i cry sometimes when im lying in bed just to get it all out whats in my head and i am feeling a little peculiar and so i wake in the morning and i step outside and i take a deep breath and i get real high and i scream at the top of my lungs whats going on
5538138 in the morning o lord you hear my voice in the morning i lay my requests before you and wait in expectation
5538139 for to me to live is christ and to die is gain
5538140 we must face the fact that in america the church is still the most segregated major institution in america at 11 00 on sunday morning when we stand and sing and christ has no east or west we stand at the most segregated hour in this nation this is tragic nobody of honesty can overlook this
5538141 he cant stand the gigantic flickering shadows the blades cast at certain points in the day
5538142 i think its pretty clear demand elasticities have been triggered in a way that will take prices lower
5538143 i do think 80 to 90 is probably where the floor is
5538144 i just read in the paper that in a few weeks i am supposedly premiering a concerto that i havent even started writing yet
5538145 instead of comping new melodies ill use the music thats already in my head
5538146 klezmer foxtrot ragtime and blues my concerto will be a tuneful kaleidoscope a rhapody about the music that surrounds me
5538147 and as usual george was drawn to it like a bear to honey
5538148 all at once the clarinet let out a wail that made the fleeing listeners stop dead in their tracks
5538149 a reference to georges use of blue notes notes added to the traditional musical scale that help give jazz its distinctive sound throughout the piece
5538150 i relied on the commemorative facsimile edition published by warner brothers in 1987 because this version comes closest to the score prepared for whitemans concert an experiment in modern music
5538151 i do think that for where we are now that this is an important road
5538152 i think were going to continue to be car dependent were going to see albemarle place built were going to see 29 get more congested were going to need a vibrant downtown
5538153 youre not thinking any longer youre just committed to voting five votes yes and thats where we go theres not going to be any debate about this
5538154 our rules governing politics must be kept up to date
5538155 we have to move away from this total ban and find ways to allow people to let off steam
5538156 we should allow outdoor public demonstrations also at the speakers corner
5538157 right now they are totally banned and for a reason passions can get stirred up and people can get carried away
5538158 this is a valid concern but i dont think an outright ban is still sensible
5538159 weve got to allow some political videos but with some safeguards
5538160 what is ok and what is not ok there will be gray areas
5538161 just because youre paranoid doesnt mean they arent after you
5538162 i still believe in spite of everything that people are truly good at heart
5538163 if you dont like me for who i am then you dont like me for who i am you
5538164 in den flugh fen diesen tempeln von zivilisation und technik herrschen in wirklichkeit die gesetze des dschungels
5538165 eine berm chtige soldateska macht sich im wege der erpressung sonst k nnen sie nicht mitfliegen an ihrem intimbereich zu schaffen durchleuchtet und durchw hlt ihre taschen betastet ihren k rper und befummelt ihre g rtelschnalle
5538166 caldwell rode an amazing race the whole thing hes on another level that definitely made me very nervous and i really had to concentrate on remembering that i know how to do this just use my form the equipment the bmc bike is just so fast its really made a difference for me as funny as that sounds youve got to pedal the bike but the bike definitely moves you as well this team is supplied with the best possible gear the sponsors and everybody that helped me a lot just knowing that i had the best gear and good form from yesterday i thought about the feeling on the podium last night when i was digging deep about 2k from here starting to remember that wanting to get that feeling back today that definitely motivating me
5538167 it was kind of cool i liked the technical turns you had to be attentive you know we keep our heads down trying to be the most aero and then a turn sneaks up on you like it did i missed one of these turns i just about went off the road but all in all it was a clean run
5538168 its sort of a comeback race in a sense for me this whole year has been a comeback after the injury last year i started to get some good form in cascade the team really started kicking and we have the same squad here its a good week for us
5538169 rarely in a room of other lobbyists do many people look like me
5538170 its very interesting to note that the local shenandoah paper republican and herald has avoided mentioning the intimidation being wrought upon at least one family of the accused teens brandon piekarskys mother received death threats by phone from someone in boston
5538171 tell your mexican friends to get the out of shenandoah or youll be laying next to him
5538172 24 what number appears at the beginning of this question
5538173 i wanted to see how long i could have gone without ya
5538174 itll be one of the slowest days of the year and i think it just kind of fed into itself
5538175 markets sell off hard for reasons that are epistemically opaque in entirely noncausal but correlative news oil rises dramatically
5538176 i knew that if there was a rotorcraft that could help me break some records it would be the grand
5538177 russia was probably the most stressful part of the trip
5538178 if i had to pick the biggest challenge that would probably be it
5538179 ive got some ideas but for now i just want to go home
5538180 people are interdependent social beings we do not and cannot live as the independent tiger or orangutan coming together only to mate briefly all child care and education provided by the mother
5538181 this has seemed obvious to me and probably it is obvious to most but it is such an important principle to base further observations on and logically it is often ignored in the present scheme of things so i think we should look at the reasons
5538182 next question is a male female unit capable of independence the answer is quite important to the issue of reproduction
5538183 i have never heard of this being done and i dont believe it can be done
5538184 it is interesting to note that walking on two legs has not been all that uncommon in the history of life but i can think of no other species that has attempted pregnancy on two legs
5538185 further problems are having very little backup for minor sprains or illness loneliness can be a big problem even for couples as most of us eventually crave other people in our lives
5538186 the genetic and archaeological evidence indicates that we split off from chimpanzees which are social creatures and that we stayed social
5538187 we are all here on earth to help others what i cant figure out is what the others are here for
5538188 lets do what we want to do and then simply talk about it in their language and ideas
5538189 since in their worldview they do not think what we are doing is possible they will think we are doing what they want us to be doing because we are talking their language we will be left alone to do exactly what we want to do right under their noses they will be happy and we will be happy without there being any need for confrontation soon they will discover that we are growing and they are not because they are stuck standing there watching us
5538190 how can we do this in a way which works fully for those in the enterprise and those in the community rather than for one more than the other
5538191 if these ideas are true what kind of an organization does it suggest
5538192 work is the means adopted for attaining a higher level of satisfaction for human aspirations and demonstrating collaboration with the other members of the community to promote the common good to ensure that it is contributed freely productively and in a manner that makes everyones collaboration viable the members shall respect its discipline namely a hierarchy
5538193 when humans are confronted with conflict their mind brains shift to a very primitive and highly reactive way of thinking called the
5538194 system of human organization that creates a conflict free environment for decision making and action implementation
5538195 this is a law of life and the more lavishingly we show kindness and concern the richer is our life in what manner we get back what we have given is of minor importance the only thing that life promises is that life pays back all its debts to us
5538196 for us to stand together united until this battle is won the people of berlin have spoken we have done our duty and we will keep on doing our duty people of the world now do your duty people of the world look at berlin
5538197 she looks better now than she has ever done im so proud i love her so much
5538198 it was as if he was trying to make a point by not being at her beck and call
5538199 im really disappointed there are a lot of people who are not here tonight but thanks to everyone who did make it
5538200 as far as being on schedule most of the projects are on schedule there could be some that are behind schedule because of the rain delays but usually the rain delays are taken into consideration
5538201 we know that there is a dry season here in south texas and we know there is a wet season knowing where the seasons fall on your project scheduling is where you take into consideration yes x amount of days for rain delays or x amount of days for bad weather delays
5538202 jon voight your evil spawn angelina jolie and her vacuous hubby brad pitt make about forty million dollars a year in violent psychopathic movies and give away three of it to starving children trying to look as if they give a crap about humanity as they spit out more dunces that will consume more than their fair share and wreck the earth even more just sayin
5538203 also miss jolie says she likes mccain too and hasnt decided who to endorse
5538204 n o se completou o prazo at a meia noite para chegar a um acordo
5538205 come a a partir de hoje uma sociedade com estas duas corpora es lafarge e holcim certamente com a maioria nas m os do estado
5538206 pois o valor solicitado pela cemex muito alto muito acima dos us 1 3 bilh o

5538208 hola me llamo john mccain y dej a mi mujer cuando qued desfigurada
5538209 were incredibly fortunate to have pete geren secretary of the u s army and general george casey chief of staff of the u s army join us via phone for the bloggers roundtable panel
5538210 i value the diary tremendously but im scared stiff its going to get lost
5538211 the army does not routinely monitor blogs regarding postings of specific personnel or groups of personnel it is not standard practice for the military to target or single out individual military blogs unless a particular blog has been brought to the attention of the chain of command or other dod department of defense officials for gross opsec operational security violations
5538212 the success of that is what will be the turning point for the soldiers to come home the faster we reconstruct the faster the soldiers can come back
5538213 there are instantaneous communications taking place around the world and we need to figure out how to take advantage of that opportunity instead of looking at it as a nemesis
5538214 you can call it strategic communication you can call it information engagement i like to call it operating in the information domain of the 21st century
5538215 so i decided after reading some other milblogs to start my own to vent my frustrations and try to keep my sanity intact as much as possible
5538216 growing up in b c toby nunn never imagined hed join the army go to war or become a celebrity let alone one of the most famous non commissioned soldiers to serve with american forces in iraq
5538217 i was just a scrawny kid from the bush up in canada
5538218 a very different view of the war than youll see on the nightly news
5538219 the only difference between suicide and martyrdom is press coverage
5538220 you just have to scratch a little bit at the surface and it comes out
5538221 sometimes something will just trigger a memory and ill just start to choke up

5538225 just gotten up to speed within the past year or so
5538226 if you knew you were taking a turn you could pause the video and line it up its as simple as that
5538227 update on fall and winter model outlook the updated european model long range monthly forecast for north america was just released last night the model forecast goes right through the heart of the upcoming winter since i cannot post the actual graphs of the model output i will interpret them for you remember these are strictly based on this one model which in my opinion is one of the more reliable ones my interpretation is for the general pattern over the course of a particular month september the model is forecasting a steady westerly zonal flow across the northern u s and southern canada slightly cooler and wetter than normal over british columbia and the yukon drier compared to normal with normal temperatures across the prairies very warm lower ohio valley through the deep south drier than normal with seasonable temps over most of ontario and southern quebec but southern ontario could be near to slightly above normal for rainfall below normal temperatures over northern quebec and labrador wetter pattern over the coastal maritimes and newfoundland normal temperatures and precipitation over the northeast u s october rather cool pattern compared to normal over the yukon territory and down into interior british columbia and western alberta warmer than normal over manitoba and most of ontario with below normal rainfall chilly pattern over northern quebec and labrador compared to normal normal temps and rain in southern quebec and new brunswick above normal rainfall and temperatures over nova scotia and pei slightly cool but wet over newfoundland very warm u s plains and midwest seasonable northeast november slightly colder but wetter than normal over british columbia and alberta milder than normal pattern over most of eastern canada with below normal precipitation wet pattern over labrador and newfoundland with seasonable temperatures normal temperatures and precipitation over the northeast u s december drier and not that cold over southern alaska cold wet pattern from bc down through northern california near to slightly above normal temperatures over the southern prairies with less than normal precipitation temperatures look fairly normal over eastern canada with near to slightly below normal precipitation above normal temperatures labrador and newfoundland normal temperatures over the northeast u s with normal precipitation january above normal temperatures over southern alaska drier pattern developing along the west coast of canada and the u s colder than normal from the prairies through ontario and into the midwestern u s and northeast actually could be a very cold month in the prairies snowier than normal around the great lakes northeast u s and quebec stormy over the maritimes but temperatures near or slightly above normal normal precip but slightly milder than normal over newfoundland pattern favors above normal lake effect snow february above normal temps and below normal snowfall over alaska drier than normal over bc and the northwestern u s cold pattern from the prairies through the northern plains of the u s and into ontario quebec the midwest u s and interior northeast normal cold closer to the coast stormier than normal along the east coast of the u s and up through the maritimes and quebec pattern favors above normal lake effect snow downwind of remaining unfrozen lakes
5538228 he is in the top tier of athletics and now hes going to get his tryout as a personality

5538230 what is the value of eight golds in beijing before a prime time audience in the u s
5538231 id say 100 million over the course of his lifetime
5538232 we continue to evaluate post beijing activities that will allow us to reinforce our relationship with michael
5538233 its huge its the opportunity that no start up generally gets
5538234 we see a lot of smoke and mirrors here they asked for a nineteen percent increase several months ago you gave them twelve and now back asking for a twenty point eight increase and theyll take anything they can get
5538235 i mainly wanted to assure you that the money we spend at tennessee american water company is well spend
5538236 theyve already increased it twelve percent in the last year or sometime recently so i dont think and increase now is necessary thats just me personally
5538237 a lot of its aging and its old water supplies in certain areas are small diameters are small diameters its corroded over time
5538238 its just a simple fact that you have to live within your means and when youre tight you have to budget and you have to see where youre coming from
5538239 its a necessary evil at this point and i realize that a lot of people feel bumbarded and hit and everybody wanting more and more and more
5538240 into viable movie product in an intelligent way so that we introduce them like planes on a runway they have to be set up the right way and lined up the right way and all take off one at a time and fly safe and fly straight
5538241 never rat on your friends and always keep your mouth shut
5538242 i found that if you have a goal that you might not reach it but if you do not have one you are never disappointed and i gotta tell you it feels phenomenal
5538243 my name is freeze learn it well for its the chilling sound of your doom
5538244 whos more foolish the fool or the fool who follows him
5538245 in america its bling bling but out here its bling bang
5538246 enterprises are used to having everything managed and monitored with feedback and audits but this just doesnt exist in storage despite its growth
5538247 many organisations dont know how much capacity they have so they keep throwing boxes into their storage which is cheap but causes thermal problems in data centres and impacts things like recovery times and tape backups
5538248 the management tools methodology and experts method just havent been available
5538249 its easier to sell bucket loads of terabytes and worry about storage later
5538250 i see businesses with a lot of storage distributed across their datacentres in very distributed environments that are throwing terabytes at the problem and might not have the right staff and processes
5538251 one way to solve the problem is to give it away but thats not what many organisations want they could benefit greatly from getting experienced staff in or have a third party help them part time or remotely
5538252 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5538253 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5538254 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5538255 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5538256 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5538257 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5538258 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5538259 sinceramente eu n sei explicar nossa abdu o pela lsi

5538261 a lot of our customers like the ubuntu desktop and use it for software development now they want to roll it out to the server we want to make sure that when they roll out ubuntu on the server they find it equally joyous
5538262 we want to make it as easy to install software on the ubuntu server as it is to for example were getting ready to release db2 and informix database management systems that come as deb packages which will install and do basic set up with only a couple of clicks or a single command line instruction
5538263 when alfresco releases alfresco enterprise release 3 later this year we will make the entire enterprise solution available through the canonical store
5538264 when it is released in a few weeks we will be offering the zimbra collaboration suite 5 5 later this year which will be a big boon for our corporate users
5538265 we see ubuntu part of a larger trend toward fragmentation of the linux marke
5538266 linux itself isnt fragmenting but we see other companies besides red hat and novell moving up with canonical being so hot on the desktop and pushing hard on the server we think the desktop will work in their favor
5538267 perhaps canonical could jump over servers i could see a cloud vendor approaching ubuntu
5538268 tout le monde est le beauf de quelquun mais mon voisin le sait pas

5538271 the courts ruling simply means that the parties will engage in discovery and proceed with the litigation the judge did not opine at all on the merits other than to conclude that fox satisfied the pleading requirements we respectfully disagree with foxs position and do not believe they have any rights in and to this project
5538272 warner brothers production and anticipated release of the watchmen motion picture violates twentieth century foxs long standing motion picture rights in the watchmen property we will be asking the court to enforce foxs copyright interests in the watchmen and enjoin the release of the warner brothers film and any related watchmen media that violate our copyright interests in that property

5538291 to act as proxy diagnosticians by looking for evidence of particular deficits perhaps missing vital signs which may indicate other difficulties at home or with learning
5538292 children with learning difficulties and poor social skills will be diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder that may remain with them for the rest of their lives
5538293 if australia were to follow the racps recommendation to include adhd as a disability category eligible for additional support funding special education budgets for all australian educational jurisdictions would skyrocket
5538294 schools and educational systems will not be able to cope with the demand and as such each additional supported child will receive less
5538295 in the end children with significant disabilities cerebral palsy autism intellectual impairment will not receive the support they require and the segregation of students with high support needs will continue to increase
5538296 more educationally and fiscally responsible approach would be to provide targeted funding for which individual schools and teachers could apply to support their access to professional development in the area of inclusive educational practice
5538297 while we offer a full range of dental services under one roof our emphasis is on more than one stop dental care
5538298 we want our patients to feel calm and at home as though they are coming to spend time with pals
5538299 our upscale modern office is a reflection of our professional commitment to stay in the cutting edge of dentistry
5538300 our patients shouldnt have to traipse from specialist to specialist to get the care they need
5538301 whether patients want to come in for a quick lunch hour whitening treatment or need extensive smile makeovers were prepared to serve them
5538302 our core belief is that patient education and prevention are as important as treatment
5538303 we want to make our community healthy which is why we offer free consultations and examinations as well as educational videos for patients to watch during their procedures
5538304 unfortunately that misses the point if you come in every six months for a dental check up you wont reach the point where you have a problem
5538305 you go for manicures for pedicures and to get your hair done having your teeth professionally cleaned is another facet of self care that makes you feel and look your best
5538306 i flew in two days ago to prepare the boat
5538307 every day we see patients who have dental anxieties fears and phobias
5538308 these fears can have a devastating effect since delays in receiving dental care can impact a persons self confidence appearance and well being left untreated dental problems can have far reaching consequences severely affecting patient health
5538309 sedation should be the last resort not the first course of action
5538310 its a quick solution that may address the symptoms of anxiety but not the underlying cause
5538311 dental anxiety is basically the fear of the unknown and can usually be addressed by taking the time to familiarize a patient with the office the equipment and the procedures
5538312 dental fear elicits more of a fight or flight response and typically can be eliminated by giving patients more control over their experience dental phobia can be harder to overcome but the same desensitization techniques used to treat other phobias also work great with dental phobia
5538313 i started by showing her all of the instruments we would be using and honestly discussing every detail of the procedure
5538314 then she went back in the waiting room until her apprehension subsided she then came back in and allowed me to do an examination and then went back out to the waiting room we repeated the process over the course of several hours but ultimately she received treatment that same day with no sedation
5538315 unfortunately many people have had humiliating or negative experiences with other dentists or have picked up on a parents dental anxiety
5538316 uncovering the source of the problem enables us to develop valuable strategies that will lead to successful treatment
5538317 if you have an open heart love can find you whatever time of life you are in
5538318 its a major victory for the new government but there is still a lot of uncertainty going forward
5538319 i leave my future in the hands of the nation and people
5538320 india will continue to have an amicable relation with pakistan in the days to come
5538321 dont worry well be home soon be a good boy
5538322 the coordination is off the charts i know the cameron crazies get a lot of pub but whats that a thousand kids at penn state were talking about 20 times that all on the same page for every situation on the field thats nuts
5538323 they raise the bar every year between the white out and the music they pump in its a festival atmosphere
5538324 espero que o mundo tenha acordado para o que est acontecendo os russos deveriam sair do meu pa s
5538325 o pior que o mundo poderia fazer seria se comprometer e mostrar fraqueza
5538326 if the negotiations dont get much more dramatic quickly i will extricate myself from the process
5538327 at the moment we think this problem in washington is not going to get solved
5538328 we have to pull the plug because all were doing is wasting money
5538329 change we can believe in barack obamas plan to renew americas promise
5538330 fundamental para os pa ses pequenos do bloco pois abrir oportunidades e facilitar as negocia es
5538331 temos a confian a de que a entrada definitiva da venezuela no bloco ser definida antes do final de 2008 a entrada da venezuela vai vertebrar a integra o sul americana
5538332 look see what we have done see what we are still doing remember when we let ourselves be led by our fear
5538333 safe and secure nuclear energy nuclear power represents more than 70 percent of our noncarbon generated electricity it is unlikely that we can meet our aggressive climate goals if we eliminate nuclear power as an option however before an expansion of nuclear power is considered key issues must be addressed including security of nuclear fuel and waste waste storage and proliferation
5538334 its incredible the lord has blessed us with antibodies our whole lifetime

5538343 a shot in the dark to predict the percentage of increase to the overall county budget
5538344 ideally there will be no new staff the new jail administrator position will hopefully pay for itself quickly
5538345 lets investigate if may not be possible it may not be needed
5538346 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous

5538362 most of the people we see discovered they have chronic hepatitis c when they went to donate blood or had a physical exam in order to get insurance
5538363 about one third of people with chronic hepatitis will go on to develop cirrhosis of the liver
5538364 only 5 to 10 percent will develop liver cancer in other words many people can live perfectly well with chronic hepatitis infection and never have any problems the trouble is we cant tell who will do well and who will die of the disease
5538365 i can usually get anyone through two or three months of interferon and ribavirin beyond that it gets really tough
5538366 at least 10 percent of patients cant make it through the recommended course of therapy
5538367 if virus levels drop off very quickly we can shorten the course of therapy if the response is slow we can lengthen it sometimes to as much as 72 weeks and improve the chances of success

5538370 we want to train and work with the u s army
5538371 we like our job here of running the traffic control point and providing security at the entrance of the patrol base
5538372 right now the iraqi soldiers have taken over the responsibility of the traffic control point but we are going to train them to be able to take over the entire patrol base go and do presence patrols and set up temporary traffic control points in our area
5538373 we are integrating with the iraqi security forces to make us a better fighting force
5538374 they have stepped up to the plate and their partnership is why we are able to take over the mission that the georgians had to leave behind with no change in the security and safety of the iraqi people
5538375 i want to fight fiercely alongside the u s army
5538376 i get more training to be able to do the job
5538377 the people received us very well and went out of their way to help us with anything they could
5538378 it was fantastic opportunity and most of the unit is already talking and asking about when we can go back
5538379 it means so much to our troops serving all over the world to see this kind of support coming from their communities
5538380 the military in a lot of ways is about community and local actions like this have a huge impact on morale
5538381 these are personal community based efforts and to have schools and young people taking part in them sends the message we this particular community we know what youre doing we know why youre doing it and were grateful

5538401 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5538402 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5538403 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5538404 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5538405 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks

5538452 certainly now what we want to see in pakistan is a period of political stability to enable the government and the parliament of pakistan to address the serious issues that pakistan faces including security issues
5538453 they have very direct consequences for the nearly thousand troops that we have in afghanistan abutting the afghanistan pakistan border
5538454 were obviously not talking about the use of military forces or combat troops but we stand ready willing and able to render the pakistani government whatever assistance we can to help it
5538455 we will call on gov david paterson to use his authority to challenge calls from the federal government to use the new york national guard for service in iraq
5538456 the governor has the power to decide if our national guard troops are to be used on a federal level
5538457 our resolution will call on him to do just that

5538464 well take over the cement plants at midnight because the deadline has come and theyll become state property
5538465 it was not possible to arrive at an agreement with them cemex and the next step that we must take is to proceed with expropriation

5538470 we are looking very carefully at the senate inquiry in relation to a number of these measures announced in the budget
5538471 ive already announced we will be opposing the tax on ready to drinks the so called alcopops
5538472 well be opposing the medicare surcharge changes the changes to income streaming for the commonwealth seniors health card and were looking very closely at the luxury car tax and the consequences for the tourism sector for large families and the australian car industry
5538473 the government did not announce prior to the election that it was going to increase taxes by 19 5 billion if were fighting inflation why is the government adding 20 billion in tax increases
5538474 were having a look at the condensate tax issue the governments done a drive by tax shooting on woodside 2 5 billion over the four years we want to make absolutely certain that there will be no impact domestically on australians as a result of that tax increase
5538475 im looking at a range of initiatives of things we meaningfully can do to take on alcohol not only for young people but across the board
5538476 young people are being stereotyped in part by the attacks on ready to drinks but the evidence that alcopops are the source of binge drinking by people does not support the assertions that have been made by the prime minister nor the health minister
5538477 while the consumption of ready to drinks alcopops has increased over the last seven years the at risk young drinkers are actually consuming fewer alcopops in a drinking session than they have been in the past
5538478 any so called compromise means more people relying on public hospitals and more people with private health insurance paying more to keep their private health insurance

5538497 let us say to the immigrant not that we hope he will learn english but that he has got to

5538504 the russians and the venezuelans can engage in whatever cooperation that they would like but its curious im not sure what venezuela needs or gains by a visit by the russian fleet
5538505 you would think that president chavez would concentrate more on the problems that the people of venezuela are having rather than inviting the fleet in for a port call

5538508 in fact hiring a person with a disability usually costs very little seventy percent of workers with disabilities require no accommodations at all for those who need special provisions perhaps a custom keyboard phone or computer program the average cost is less than 500
5538509 in exchange for going the extra mile to hire someone with a disability employers in surveys consistently say they get a worker who is often better than average with good attendance punctuality and acceptance of authority surveys also find that those with disabilities are less likely to have an accident at work

5538758 a very popular error having the courage of ones convictions rather it is a matter of having the courage for an attack upon ones convictions
5538759 i have examined all the known superstitions of the world and i do not find in our particular superstition of christianity one redeeming feature they are all alike founded on fables and mythology millions of innocent men women and children since the introduction of christianity have been burnt tortured fined and imprisoned what has been the effect of this coercion to make one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites to support roguery and error all over the earth
5538760 a human being is part of a whole called by us the universe a part limited in time and space he experiences himself his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness this delusion is a kind of prison for us restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest us our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circles of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty
5538761 of all the enemies to public liberty war is perhaps the most to be dreaded because it comprises and develops the germ of every other war is the parent of armies from these proceed debts and taxes and armies and debts and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few in war too the discretionary power of the executive is extended its influence in dealing out offices honors and emoluments is multiplied and all the means of seducing the minds are added to those of subduing the force of the people the same malignant aspect in republicanism may be traced in the inequality of fortunes and the opportunities of fraud growing out of a state of war and in the degeneracy of manners and morals engendered by both no nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare
5538762 in the end the party would announce that 2 plus 2 made 5 and you would have to believe it it was inevitable that they should make that claim sooner or later the logic of their position demanded it

5538764 all national institutions of churches whether jewish christian or turkish appear to me no other than human inventions set up to terrify and enslave mankind and monopolize power and profit
5538765 i do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise they have the same right to their belief as i have to mine but it is necessary to the happiness of man that he be mentally faithful to himself infidelity does not consist in believing or in disbelieving it consists in professing to believe what he does not believe
5538766 the modern conservative is engaged in one of mans oldest exercises in moral philosophy that is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness
5538767 let your boat of life be light packed with only what you need a homely home and simple pleasure one or two friends worth the name someone to love and someone to love you a cat a dog and a pipe or two enough to eat and enough to wear and a little more than enough to drink for thirst is a dangerous thing
5538768 we are all born ignorant but one must work hard to remain stupid
5538769 a thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity stability and beauty of the biotic community it is wrong when it tends otherwise
5538770 living is a constant process of deciding what we are going to do
5538771 the founders of our nation were nearly all infidels and that of the presidents who had thus far been elected washington adams jefferson madison monroe adams jackson not a one had professed a belief in christianity
5538772 among all our presidents from washington downward not one was a professor of religion at least not of more than unitarianism
5538773 undoubtedly all men are not equally fit subjects for civilization and because the majority like dogs and sheep are tame by inherited disposition this is no reason why the others should have their natures broken that they may be reduced to the same level
5538774 there are plenty of good reasons for fighting but no good reason ever to hate without reservation to imagine that god almighty himself hates with you too wheres evil its that large part of every man that wants to hate without limit that wants to hate with god on its side its that part of every man that finds all kinds of ugliness so attractive its that part of an imbecile that punishes and vilifies and makes war gladly
5538775 i am diogenes the dog i nuzzle the kind bark at the greedy and bite scoundrels

5538777 we could get frustrated but the wheels come off when you start to argue

5538780 its important to have a fast start and we did that we played the best team weve played so far and we played steady

5538787 the pipes still work when the pipes work theres nothing like it
5538788 that whole way of thinking to do something like that on the last day of adjournment is unconscionable the liberal democratic leadership of the house walked away from its responsibility to the american people

5538794 the procedure is not one that would be recommended for everybody
5538795 there are definitely groups of patients where this can be done with the same results and fewer complications
5538796 certainly now what we want to see in pakistan is a period of political stability to enable the government and the parliament of pakistan to address the serious issues that pakistan faces including security issues
5538797 they have very direct consequences for the nearly thousand troops that we have in afghanistan abutting the afghanistan pakistan border

5538800 sales tax collections which would now have to grow at 4 9 percent to make the fiscal year 2009 forecast grew at an average rate of only 0 8 percent in the last four months of the fiscal year likewise income tax withholding which would now have to grow at 6 4 percent to make the 2009 forecast grew at an average rate of only 1 6 percent in the same four month period
5538801 as anyone reading newspaper headlines knows the effects of the ongoing housing downturn and turmoil in financial markets continue to be a drag on economic growth
5538802 its a lot easier to avoid making new spending commitments than it is to cut spending after the fact
5538803 we can easily over commit in the budget and build expectations we cannot meet if we fail to estimate revenues conservatively

5538806 i will be supporting the removal of abortion from the crimes act i think thats the right thing its the right thing in terms of public policy
5538807 but i would stress that the proposal we are putting to the parliament is one that would be consistent and fully consistent with current clinical practice
5538808 for women i think its a crucial matter for them that a personal decision theyve made about themselves and their body is subject to action under the criminal code
5538809 removing this from the criminal code is important for women it is something that many women and many womens organisations have fought long and hard for so i think its important
5538810 today the rights of the unborn children have been forsaken by the victorian government this is a very very sad event
5538811 i dont want women any more to feel that this is some kind of terrible shame
5538812 interestingly this morning all the emails that i have been getting are from women in my age group who underwent similar sort of circumstances themselves and i think its really important to bring down that taboo
5538813 if it is that the bill reflects the second of the third options as reflected in the paper then i will oppose it
5538814 commodore bainimarama at the pacific island leaders forum in tonga in october last year gave a faithful and unconditional undertaking to have an election in fiji before the end of march next year
5538815 he was compelled as a matter of honour to turn up to the forum and explain himself to the leaders
5538816 it is very disappointing that he wont turn up to effectively take his medicine
5538817 so its very disappointing and i think the leaders in niue including our own prime minister will understandably be very gravely disappointed at the refusal of commodore bainimarama to turn up
5538818 australia needs to argue strongly both regionally in the pacific and in the international community that fiji must return to democracy must return to respecting human rights and the rule of law and democratic processes in fiji
5538819 in my view that is not the best interest of the region especially for fiji and the solomon islands
5538820 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5538821 why tonality as such should be thrown out for good i cant see

5538825 there is a lot of expectation but im thankful that i walk into something thats already been developed
5538826 the tradition the standard of play has already been set
5538827 of course we wanted them to stay needed them to stay
5538828 but we have some great girls to come and fill their shoes so its just going to be another challenge
5538829 whats nice about that challenge is those girls know how to win
5538830 they have the winning mentality already they have that hunger they have that intuition they have those natural born instincts of wanting to compete and thats something thats really hard to teach people if they go into programs that are not as successful
5538831 i think were going to surprise a lot of people
5538832 i think our girls are coming around i do think theres going to be some heavy hits were going to take but thats part of the learning curve that we all have to go through
5538833 we want to be the top four in our conference and hopefully get a shot to the ncaa tournament again weve been there before we know what its like we know what it takes so hopefully the new girls can step into some big roles and well get there again
5538834 lets sit down and contemplate our feelings and how our future feelings might be right now damnit i need a feelings meeting
5538835 era impresionante ver a tanta gente a nuestro alrededor fiestas de este estilo son la mejor forma de darse a conocer pese a que nosotros los del escenario san pepi o no recibamos retribuci n econ mica pero siempre es gratificante ver que eres capaz de llegarle a la gente con tu m sica

5538837 i would not have nominated clarence thomas i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation of a lot of the constitution
5538838 though he assured the audience that at least they were smart enough for the job
5538839 so lets see by the time he was nominated clarence thomas had worked in the missouri attorney generals office served as an assistant secretary of education run the equal employment opportunity commission and sat for a year on the d c circuit court of appeals the nations second most prominent court
5538840 isnt yet four years out of the illinois state senate has never held a hearing of note with his u s senate subcommittee and had an unremarkable record as both a community organizer and law school lecturer
5538841 and if no one is listening then it is because they dont want to hear because this is a referendum people dont need anyone to represent them they are representing themselves as somebody who has followed peoples movements and who has been in rallies and at the heart or the edge of things i dont think you can dispute what you see here
5538842 since the 1930s there have been debates and disputes about who has the right to represent the kashmiri people whether it was hari singh or sheikh abdullah or someone else and the debate continues till today whether it is the hurriyat or some other party
5538843 india needs azadi from kashmir as much as kashmir needs azadi from india
5538844 look son apologies to feminists here ill allow you to indulge in your delinquent behaviour in about two years from now when you are sixteen so why dont we make a deal and you have your freedom unquestioned and unfettered two years from now if you just exercise a little more self control now
5538845 thats not an issue on the table and i just want to keep our focus on what we must do with the democratic government of pakistan
5538846 whether im impeached or not the countrys stability will be compromised the office of the president will also be insulted pakistan is my love now and always my life is for pakistan i have defended and will continue to defend pakistan i want to be able to bring pakistan out of the current crisis so i think perhaps i should do something but i also do not want to do something that may generate uncertainty in the country i also want to save the parliament from horse trading even if the impeachment is defeated the relations between the presidents office and the coalition govt will not heal therefore with this situation in view and having consulted my legal and political advisors i have decided to resign from my post
5538847 how much i hate india and how much i will sacrifice to save muslim brothers in kashmir
5538848 that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5538849 senator mccain was in a motorcade led by the united states secret service and held in a green room with no broadcast feed
5538850 may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5538851 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5538852 that room was totally free with no monitors a flat out lie
5538853 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because that what theyre putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5538854 a motorist survey this year by the rubber manufacturers association found that 85 percent of american drivers do not properly check tire inflation pressure this is an alarming statistic since tires are the only part of a vehicle in contact with the road and a critical vehicle safety component
5538855 drivers across the u s can battle rising gas prices by simply maintaining proper tire inflation
5538856 current statistics indicate that 82 million vehicles have under inflated tires which means more rubber is hitting the road and accordingly miles per gallon is lessened in fact tire experts speculate that 2 8 billion gallons of gas is wasted by u s drivers each year simply because theyre driving on under inflated tires
5538857 the chps traffic safety commitment extends to safety campaigns like these which aim to reduce needless fatalities and injuries on california highways
5538858 our research shows that this improper inflation issue has been prevalent for years
5538859 that andreas excuse for leveling accusation against mac you buy into that prfsr
5538860 we as a campaign have not said anything about it though the mccain folks do seem pretty sensitive on the point
5538861 he made time to go to the gym but canceled a visit with wounded troops
5538862 obama had no intention of bringing any cameras with him i was there i can vouch for that

5538908 impositions of the arroyo regime and the big mining companies will only fuel protests and unrests and militarization will only intensify armed resistance from the people
5538909 the present philippine rule is a de facto martial rule a far cry from the so called vibrant democracy that even the present canadian government seems to stubbornly think and adhere to
5538910 international solidarity of peoples across the world has made this possible
5538911 the number of killings may have noticeably decreased in the last 6 months due to the local and international pressure but the killings definitely have not stopped getting arroyo and bush out of the scene may not be the total answer but may be a start for better things to come

5538940 we have an amazing collection of scrapbooks about the royal family they were maintained by head librarians of yore and date back to the duke and duchess of kents wedding in 1934 there are 69 volumes in total featuring newspaper clippings about the abdication crisis royal visits to canada the coronation of elizabeth ii etc researchers on pop up royals used them extensively and thought they were wonderful
5538941 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5538942 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5538943 this is a broad really diffuse storm all the florida keys and all the florida peninsula are going to feel the effects of this storm no matter where the center makes landfall

5538950 she noticed that one of her competitors therese alshammar of sweden was having trouble with her swimsuit took time out of her warming up and went to try to help her
5538951 when she realized she couldnt fix the problem she went to the official and asked if the race could be delayed until the other swimmer could change
5538952 ive still got a rather lengthy amount of time before i decide anything
5538953 the pendulum is swinging very heavily in the direction of it just being over ive never sat around and not gotten ready to head to florida well not in 23 or so years anyway so to me that will likely be the last real test for me and whether or not i want to put the time and effort into getting after it one more time
5538954 next i started thinking about the original plan of pitching the 2nd half of next season thing is that urgency just is not there i miss some things i didnt think i would and dont miss many things
5538955 and why not it seems this must be answered first why not because it means there is no other because it means my decrepit life if the extent of feeling because it means feeling is real because it means i have no purpose and no alternative but if you give up the fear of the self if you embrace your body as an instrument of keen perception and face the reality of death youll savor life more youll find its magic and youll come to love the world fueled by what we call god

5538958 the number of times that a physician will deal with a surrogate decision maker is growing as our population ages and conditions such as alzheimers disease become more common the issue of how physicians interact with surrogates is a very important one we found that physicians often want to take an active role in determining what is right for a patient and often grapple with the needs of the patient versus those of the surrogate
5538959 i always think its important that its not a decision that the family member or the surrogate is making for themselves but it is a decision that they are making for someone else based upon their best knowledge of what that person would want
5538960 when i feel strongly that the patients quality of life is really poor then i do feel that it is appropriate for the physician to try and guide the family member toward a decision
5538961 if the patient cant make the decision then i discuss it with the family i sometimes will push the family to do what i think is best for the patient
5538962 i think family burden is an issue i dont think it should govern what the final decision is but i do think it should be addressed
5538963 in an age when genetic engineering of the human person is a distinct possibility the challenges our society faces in bioethics have never been more pressing
5538964 the medical school and i have long recognized the importance of bioethics for patient centered care responsible research and technological progress im very pleased that with the generous support of wally and mona wu and the university were now in a position to become nationally prominent in this field
5538965 developments in medicine and biotechnology create an acute need for more advanced education in bioethics
5538966 wake forest is perfectly suited to filling this need with our unique combination of strengths in life sciences the professions and the humanities
5538967 the course of study is designed to assist professionals in deepening their knowledge and understanding of bioethics in order to enhance practice in a variety of fields related to health care delivery and biomedical research

5538971 this pathogen has spread to all the oceans of the world and is resistant to many antibiotics
5538972 no one has seen such a rapid triggering of autophagy before
5538973 treating the human cells with an autophagy inhibitor halted the protein breakdown process but did not save the cells because v para uses other pathways by which to kill cells
5538974 however because it can kill by several routes its important to understand all of them
5538975 weve received a wake up call that this is important environmentally and we want to understand at the molecular level how this pathogen infects kills and persists
5538976 there are people getting sick from this emerging pathogen in the united states yet there is no major effort to understand its pathology
5538977 there are many ways to kill a cell and weve discovered yet another one the bacterium hijacks activities from us and deregulates them its like a bulldozer

5538980 seeing such a long outage during the very first few days makes us wonder if a free solution provided by google is actually pro enough for us we cannot correspond with schools in africa or partners in denmark and afford being out of mail for a whole day
5538981 i can give them a lot of credit for providing a free service but they lose some of that when saying your email is totally inaccessible and were not going to tell you why or for how long its arrogant im a system administrator so i deserve to know a little more
5538982 were quite busy leading up to the convention i have relied on gmail not only for email but for my primary contact list and was totally isolated for more than a day
5538983 i was on client deadlines and had to work around for re routes and resends of emails from those clients
5538984 i do remind myself that im not paying for the service and that theres a level of patience and adequate backup youve got to have when youre getting something for free
5538985 with 12 300 000 results following i have updated the title from the one showing in the google index but thats still pretty impressive
5538986 the early returns on google knol and search engine optimization
5538987 at first i thought this odd but then it made a lot of sense i certainly never go to the wikipedia home page to browse my way to a wikipedia entry usually i get to an entry by searching for the topic and typically from having done that search on google itself
5538988 were going to start seeing a flurry of articles on the most popular content expect to see dozens of biographies on barack obama and john mccain in the next few days for these popular subjects the system should work well a few lucky and hopefully credible articles will rise to the top and the rest will fade away
5538989 but to ask search engines perennial spam defining question is it good for users you find six or sixteen or sixty pages on druidic religions which do you read who do you believe when they disagree and how do you find them and know that there are other knols on the same topic
5538990 what if google highlights knols in someway different from other results look at what it does for youtube videos and other google content with its universal search
5538991 theres a lot to be won by allowing everyone to quickly do edits but a more tightly controlled model may have benefits as well and perhaps all those people complaining about wikipedia or who had wikipedia articles they started be deleted as wikipedia does not allow all kinds of entries will now consider knol a potential new home for research and sharing
5538992 part of contributing to wikipedia is that youre anonymous would you really want someone to know that despite being a huge football fan you also knew about my little pony

5538996 the number of times that a physician will deal with a surrogate decision maker is growing as our population ages and conditions such as alzheimers disease become more common the issue of how physicians interact with surrogates is a very important one we found that physicians often want to take an active role in determining what is right for a patient and often grapple with the needs of the patient versus those of the surrogate
5538997 i always think its important that its not a decision that the family member or the surrogate is making for themselves but it is a decision that they are making for someone else based upon their best knowledge of what that person would want
5538998 when i feel strongly that the patients quality of life is really poor then i do feel that it is appropriate for the physician to try and guide the family member toward a decision
5538999 if the patient cant make the decision then i discuss it with the family i sometimes will push the family to do what i think is best for the patient
5539000 i think family burden is an issue i dont think it should govern what the final decision is but i do think it should be addressed
5539001 in an age when genetic engineering of the human person is a distinct possibility the challenges our society faces in bioethics have never been more pressing
5539002 the medical school and i have long recognized the importance of bioethics for patient centered care responsible research and technological progress im very pleased that with the generous support of wally and mona wu and the university were now in a position to become nationally prominent in this field
5539003 developments in medicine and biotechnology create an acute need for more advanced education in bioethics
5539004 wake forest is perfectly suited to filling this need with our unique combination of strengths in life sciences the professions and the humanities
5539005 the course of study is designed to assist professionals in deepening their knowledge and understanding of bioethics in order to enhance practice in a variety of fields related to health care delivery and biomedical research
5539006 there was less blood loss with this procedure than with conventional surgery and there is the potential for a faster recovery
5539007 the results were outstanding and suggest the robot assisted surgery is an attractive option for fistulas that would normally require abdominal surgery
5539008 robot assisted surgery has promise to bridge the limitations of laparoscopic surgery and allow more women with fistulas urinary incontinence or prolapsed pelvic organs to benefit from a minimally invasive approach
5539009 this pathogen has spread to all the oceans of the world and is resistant to many antibiotics
5539010 no one has seen such a rapid triggering of autophagy before
5539011 treating the human cells with an autophagy inhibitor halted the protein breakdown process but did not save the cells because v para uses other pathways by which to kill cells
5539012 however because it can kill by several routes its important to understand all of them
5539013 weve received a wake up call that this is important environmentally and we want to understand at the molecular level how this pathogen infects kills and persists
5539014 there are people getting sick from this emerging pathogen in the united states yet there is no major effort to understand its pathology
5539015 there are many ways to kill a cell and weve discovered yet another one the bacterium hijacks activities from us and deregulates them its like a bulldozer

5539018 my homestead is located in a municipality and is greater than acre about 82 acres i purchased the house before i was married in 2002 recently after we had been married about 1 year and 5 months we filed a quit claim deed so that my wife is now a joint owner of the house from what i understand florida law automatically considers this tenancy by the entireties ownership if i was to receive a judgment against me is my homestead protected from a forced sale and distribution to the creditors of 39 of the proceeds since it is also my wifes homestead and she is a joint owner in this situation am i subject to any look back periods as far as when the ownership was changed the reason it was changed so far after the wedding is that my wife lived separately from me to complete a residency program the quit claim deed was filed the month that she moved in with me and the house became her primary residence
5539019 either these machines were downgraded by sellers like or hp or they were downgraded by the user after they got the machine
5539020 in any case these machines are no longer running vista
5539021 the 35 is only an estimate but it shows a trend within our own user base
5539022 vistas installed base certainly doesnt equal the number of vista licenses that microsofts sold

5539037 one of the most popular retellings of the story of the tragic king sharon kay penmans somber the sunne in splendor
5539038 imperator caesar augustus to give him is proper title was one of the most influential men in history as romes first emperor he transformed the chaotic roman republic into an orderly imperial autocracy his consolidation of the roman empire two thousand years ago laid the foundations on which europe both as a region and as a culture was subsequently built if anyone qualifies as the founding father of western civilization it is augustus
5539039 julius turned over to him the responsibility for managing the theatrical program of the triumphal celebrations
5539040 keen to show his commitment octavius stayed to the end of all the performances even on the hottest and longest days
5539041 it was widely noticed that at the theatrical events and public banquets octavius was invariably in attendance on his great uncle who treated him affectionately as if he were his own son
5539042 increasingly suppliants approached octavius and asked him to intercede for them with caesar in one way or another
5539043 caesar made up his mind quickly about people he was impressed by octavius who was growing into a thoughtful and prudent young man and detected great promise in him
5539044 years later octavius enemies claimed that he slept with his great uncle in return for his favor and affection it is true that octavius was a pretty boy that caesar may have been sexually omnivorous and that roman laws against incest prohibited only sexual relations between paternal kin however had there been anything much to the story it would surely have been common gossip at the time and received wider and earlier currency in contemporary accounts
5539045 was simultaneously impermeably strong and invisibly weak romans were enormously proud of the republic formed after the expulsion of the kings in the sixth century bc
5539046 his critics believed that with an insatiable desire for total power he was set on establishing a monarchy
5539047 the gap between him and romans of the old school was unbridgeable and seeing no point in disguising his power he had himself declared dictator for life
5539048 but since actium people of power in the eastern provinces were unwilling to supply yet more soldiers to bolster what they judged to be a lost cause
5539049 also he gave back to the political class its glittering prizes once more it became worthwhile to compete for political office even though the princeps tended to select the candidates the ambitious and the able could win glory on the floor of the senate or in the outposts of the empire

5539075 as the suco chief i have delivered their request to the government through the ministry of social solidarity the answer was that the repatriation to their homes can only be done this coming july
5539076 its better if we do this when they ask for it themselves rather than we force them to return home which will give rise to problems
5539077 the suco and aldeia chiefs should have a copy of the refugee data as a resource to check for those refugees who have already gone home
5539078 if all of our demands are not heeded by the national parliament then the students will go on a hunger strike in front of the offices of the national parliament until parliaments plan to buy the luxury cars is cancelled
5539079 the struggle has achieved its objectives but the people are still suffering hunger and there is no employment even the veterans have yet to receive a single cent so the plan to buy luxury cars is an extravagance on top of the peoples suffering
5539080 if we build our house the neighbours will just burn it down again
5539081 the leader said the land was his and the people who lived here before couldnt come back
5539082 in the ceremony we would kill a cow or a goat and get the blood and mix it with palm wine and then all drink a cup of it
5539083 if the people in the neighbourhood dont accept the families back maybe theyve had a problem with them in the past because theyve committed crimes these cases have to be taken to the police and then to trial because people have to follow law and order
5539084 the law is for the important people and the smart people and thats it
5539085 we ignorant people dont understand any of it but all of us eastern and western timorese alike understand our traditional ceremonies
5539086 it appears that the murder was planned and so we have asked the police to thoroughly investigate the case

5539088 we developed this program to illustrate my lifes vision and the program is more focused on monitoring police and prison cells with the objective of combating the occurrence of the torture of people who are arrested and those under detention in cells all of this begins from my experiences in the past because i do not want this to happen again to anyone else
5539089 i was moved from one place to another and eventually detained for 9 months in bekora prison and 3 months in the balide cells i was only released in february 1999
5539090 all that became my motivation to do something that would benefit this country and state
5539091 the joys and sorrows of working in the ftm ngo make it interesting enough because there are good things and bad but i feel satisfied because i have been able to run this organisation for 4 years the sorrows are greater than the joys

5539118 we are well prepared for valencia of course we started our preparations for this new track by looking at the fia information and that allowed us to put forward some speed profiles in order to estimate downforce and braking requirements for example
5539119 we also sent staff to look at the inaugural race meeting there at the end of july and that gave us additional data with regards to speed profiles driving lines and track surface
5539120 we expect the track to be in the mid range of downforce and quite severe on brakes
5539121 at the beginning we anticipate grip will be quite low but that should improve throughout the weekend in terms of performance we clearly want to build on the competitiveness shown in hungary we are genuinely challenging to be the third quickest car based on the last few races valencia will also show how well teams can react to new conditions so it will be an interesting weekend and we have every reason to be feeling very positive

5539158 japan consumes 14 barrels of oil a year per capita
5539159 if china used the same amount per capita as parsimonious japan chinese consumption would total more than 18 billion barrels a year an amount that dwarfs our countrys 7 5 billion barrels
5539160 add that to new demand for oil stemming from india the newest members of the european community an increasingly prosperous brazil and so on for those trying to discern the long term future of oil prices this is considerable food for thought

5539211 sir i refuse to be apart of the senseless murder of innocent lives when it can be prevented
5539212 i think you just killed the captain farber and carson listen man i dont want to shoot you and i dont want to be shot so lets make a deal
5539213 the kind of deal that involves you dropping your gun and surrendering to me
5539214 what the fuck do you want me to do rj just let you walk away into the desert
5539215 listen bradley you got two choices you shoot me right here or you let me walk away and you tell our superiors what ever you want but if you make the first choice i promise you your dead to
5539216 what are you going to do if i let you go
5539217 after that day my life was never the same after that day i was a dead man one of the women i had saved agreed to bring me to the leader of the terrorist cell
5539218 the first day was the most brutal our water was limited and some of the women and children where not use to the hard pace
5539219 she had been trained by somebody i could tell by the way she walked and her endurance was close to my own
5539220 there is something about being lead across the desert on camel that makes you come to terms with the world and its truths
5539221 this is bull shit so much for a safe passage out of the desert
5539222 that pretty much it wasnt easy getting back to the states but here i am
5539223 this is no reason it is only an excuse to defend themselves all his life my brother could not speak clearly because he long suffered from epilepsy if he wanted something he would signal with his hands
5539224 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5539225 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5539226 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5539227 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5539228 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5539229 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5539230 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5539235 the bus was coming down a steep hill towards the bridge at the bottom and from what i can see at the scene that bus has not managed to go round the bend and has careered through a wall and down a drop into a garden
5539236 theres a bus in a difficult situation which crews have had to secure and obviously the crews are working very hard in difficult circumstances
5539237 i heard this massive crash rumble of either crunching metal or what sounded to me initially as a thunderstorm as it was heavily raining before
5539238 then after that we heard shouts and screams so we obviously put it down to a crash
5539239 when i got to the scene there was a bus overturned it looked like it had ploughed into a car and then down a neighbours driveway into the garden
5539240 it must have dropped about 20ft it was on a slope its diagonal not head first
5539241 there were people climbing out of the fire exits on the bus there were many walking wounded all being seen to by the ambulance staff
5539242 its a narrow country road its mayhem absolute mayhem we had a torrential downpour of rain just before it happened
5539243 i was in the local pub when someone came in screaming for blankets and sheets
5539244 we all went to help but the area had been cordoned off by police

5539257 the bus was heading down a steep hill towards the bridge and a tight bend
5539258 it has failed to negotiate the bend and went straight through the wall instead

5539278 the practice of force feeding birds in order to produce foie gras is simply cruel and inhumane more often than not this tortuous practice involves utilizing a metal tube to forcibly feed birds typically ducks or geese with excessive amounts of food for a period of several weeks which essentially induces liver damage and a tremendous amount of pain the abolition of this practice is long overdue and must be done immediately
5539279 the delicacy of foie gras french for fatty liver is produced by force feeding ducks until their livers swell to ten times their healthy size in reality foie gras is a disease not a delicacy council member avellas resolution will put pressure on state lawmakers to put an end to this egregious animal cruelty immediately
5539280 we are enormously grateful to council member avella for his continued leadership on animal welfare at city hall

5539283 this legislation will limit the displacement of people who move in order to keep pets and provide much needed homes for animals at shelters who might otherwise be euthanized due to the lack of available homes
5539284 however despite the existence of 30 sponsors on this bill and two years after its introduction the bill has yet to be scheduled for a public hearing
5539285 i told my colleagues it is shameful that the real estate industry has succeeded in creating an atmosphere through a campaign of disinformation where we are unable to schedule a hearing on this bill
5539286 my colleagues and i are obligated by our position as elected officials to listen to the publics opinion on this very important issue in addition to that of the industry and to listen in a public forum not just in behind the scenes visits from lobbyists whose assertions are never challenged therefore after more than two years and more given the lengthy history of this issue i find it necessary to exercise my right to make a sponsors privilege request to demand a hearing on this legislation

5539341 were now in the air and im sitting in seat 8d for this one hour flight over to pendleton down below is interstate 84 and if i was behind the wheel of my car the same trip would take about three times as long thats one reason why officials in pendleton say the non stop link to portland is so crucial
5539342 there are specialists doctors attorneys who do direct business between portland and pendleton
5539343 pendleton hasnt grown much in the last 20 years were aware of that
5539344 if your business is in portland it seems a little silly to fly to walla walla and seattle to get to the major metropolitan area in your own state if you have to fly that other route you cant go to portland and back in a day so its not very practical
5539345 success is really dependant upon how much does that community want to travel and what kind of commitment will they make to travel because in the long run subsidies can only last a short time the idea is to seed the activity and then watch it grow

5539351 her knee was hurting too much after the prelim she had to take a day off
5539352 the main thing is that this was a knee that was completely reconstructed when she was 15 and we knew and she injured it again by landing it in a way that wouldnt have injured a healthy person she bent her knee further from the previous injury
5539353 and when somebody has a knee like that you dont expect them to have as long a career so shes really pushed herself a lot
5539354 those kinds of images have a great effect on children and what they think they might want to do or how they can do

5539379 is the player a credit to the organization the city and the league
5539380 well i know that people who followed terry in portland over the years know exactly why i picked him as our coach hes just an incredibly class human being first of all a great guy somebody who i was teammates with in san antonio for two seasons so i got to know terry very well once everything went down with mike dantoni and my search began terry was the first guy on my list just because of his experience in basketball and the type of person he is how smart he is what kind of leader he is i felt like we got the best man for the job i really liked the fact that he had a couple of years as a head coach in milwaukee for experience purposes you ask around the league about terry and everybody raves about him hes just the kind of person i want on my team and im excited to have him
5539381 is he a credit to the organization the city and the league
5539382 what did you expect steve to say he hired terry after all of course hes going to say hes a great guy
5539383 hes just the kind of person i want on my team
5539384 terry is just the kind of person whose jersey should be hanging from the rose garden rafters
5539385 hes a great communicator and his coaching experience two years as a head coach is important to me the fact that hes sat in that chair that was a key factor hes very tough minded

5539388 some places in the perth hills or the citys south may get 5mm but areas immediately north of perth are only likely to get a few spots
5539389 when you compare the faces and head shapes of children with specific types of autism to other children it is obvious there are variations currently autism diagnosis is purely behavior based and doctors use tape measurements to check for facial and brain dissimilarities we are in the process of developing a quantitative method that will accurately measure these differences and allow for earlier more precise detection of specific types of the disorder
5539390 once we have created a formula we can pre screen children by performing a quick non invasive scan of each childs face and brain to check for abnormalities early detection is crucial in treating children and preparing families
5539391 instead of looking at brain structures slice by slice in an mri magnetic resonance image we developed tools to create 3 d representations of the structures in order to visualize and make comparisons
5539392 using the 3 d representations we are comparing the brain structures of autistic children to those of non autistic children no one has ever done that
5539393 our research group is exploiting a tremendous overlap of knowledge from a number of disciplines yes work will be a pivotal part of anrgs grand scheme
5539394 to solve these problems it takes an entire community of specialists working together
5539395 this study will potentially demonstrate that it is the regimen of administration of birth control pills rather than their specific formulation that results in successful therapy of pmdd
5539396 if we can eliminate the hormone cycling we should eliminate the pmdd symptoms
5539397 theyre regulators of mood and emotion so if you can eliminate the metabolites that have been implicated in pmdd you may create a huge benefit for women with pmdd
5539398 we believe this trial will help us understand the underlying physiology which will allow for the development of a range of possible new therapys
5539399 id gain weight my face would be puffy i had horrible cramps and that would get me mentally down the symptoms changed as i matured and had children it gradually became more emotional now it also affects my mental acuity and i can still get down sometimes
5539400 the impairment and reduction in quality of life for women with pmdd during their premenstrual phase is equivalent to people with major depression anxiety disorder and even post traumatic stress disorder
5539401 if we can show that continuous low dose contraceptives are effective that opens up another option that may have a better risk benefit profile than ssris
5539402 a number of women in our prior studies felt better knowing they were contributing to furthering our knowledge about this disorder and informing subsequent therapy options
5539403 we can give them a gold standard diagnosis if they do have pmdd and if they have something else we can help them find therapy for it
5539404 i know what to do and where to go i have all the information and i know help is there theres such a peace of mind from that
5539405 the more we understand the better we can treat it and the better for everyone
5539406 there is so much lost productivity in women with pmdd just think how much more a woman could accomplish if she didnt have to lose so much of herself and her energy every month
5539407 prior research has suggested that its not individual hiv viruses that get into the brain but rather hiv infected immune cells known as monocytes
5539408 using an animal model we wanted to find out first of all whether being infected with hiv enables monocytes to do what they dont commonly do escape from blood vessels and enter brain tissue
5539409 these results demonstrated very clearly that being infected with hiv somehow gives monocytes the capacity to cross an intact bbb
5539410 but we also suspected that something else was making it easier for hiv infected monocytes to breach the defenses protecting the brain from infection
5539411 clearly hiv infected monocytes uniquely benefit from the lps that is present in high amounts in the blood of hiv infected people
5539412 so when hiv infected monocytes are knocking on the door of the bbb and starting to crack it open the lps facilitates their entry by making the bbb more permeable apparently by weakening blood vessel structure
5539413 these results demonstrate very dramatically that hiv infection of cells linked to the bbb in conjunction with lps exposure contributes to bbb breakdown
5539414 so when hiv infection occurs we seem to have a 1 2 3 combination of punches working in concert to facilitate entry of hiv infected monocytes into the bbb protected brain hiv infection of monocytes increases their capacity to cross even an intact bbb hiv infection in the gut releases lps into the bloodstream allowing it to erode the bbb and hiv infection of the cells of the bbb makes them more sensitive to the deleterious effects of lps
5539415 we may be able to use antibiotics that kill intestinal bacteria that make lps and drugs are already available that can bind to lps and clear it from the bloodstream
5539416 ideally we would promptly start newly diagnosed hiv infected patients on a therapy to reinforce their bbbs so that hiv cant penetrate it and perhaps we could even strengthen the bbbs of people whove been infected for quite a while but before we can prevent the tragedy of hiv associated dementia we need to better understand the mechanism by which these molecular and cellular punches interact to undermine the bbb
5539417 the citizen did the right thing they noticed something that was out of place and unusual and brought it to our attention
5539418 absolutely especially with the dnc coming up we want to be aware of all of these suspicious objects and things that dont belong

5539423 we are pleased that the yieldplus investor group selected our firm as the lead counsel for the class action and that the court approved that decision
5539424 the courts ratification of the groups selection means investors and witnesses now know where to get information about the suit and to whom they should provide vital information that will allow this suit to be prosecuted effectively

5539479 we are certainly not guilty of straying off the guided path far from it however charles wallis and i have managed to scrape some funds together and bought our old flame at an auction it was a calculated risk but we had a personal interest in racing flame again and while she looked a little tired we were sure a little tender loving care would be needed to have her ship shape again

5539483 i know but i just wanted to make sure that we are far enough away that we arent being tailed
5539484 im going to check on junior he hasnt come up here since weve taken off
5539485 ever since i reprogrammed him hes had that quality im not sure if i crossed some wires or something but im not going to go back and change it now ive kind of gotten used to the idea of him like that
5539486 dont be afraid you should remember me i was the one that came and saved you and jake i even reassembled you
5539487 now how about coming to the front of the ship with me and join jake at the pilot seat
5539488 okay seems as though you are a little anxious to get up there
5539489 i think we are out of the mess now so you dont need to hide anymore
5539490 we are close to yavin 2 if you want you can see it right out in front of us
5539491 now all we need to do is find his ship somewhere on the surface
5539492 can we scan the planets surface to see if we can find any sign of a ship
5539493 i already did there are too many mineral deposits on the planet that it shows marks all over the place and if one of them was rekanis ship we wouldnt be able to tell
5539494 we are going to have to see him with our eyes
5539495 can you narrow down the scope to anything large enough to be a ship
5539496 ill see what comes up but i dont think it will narrow down the search to just one or two locations
5539497 we are coming in at this point right now so we can start our search there hopefully we wont have to search for too long
5539498 think you can help us out here i doubt our eyes will catch him as easily as your will
5539499 i guess well head for that one spot to see if he is there
5539500 somehow i knew youd be the perfect one for the job
5539501 its about time you showed up our numbers are slowly dwindling and we could use the extra fire power we are only down to about five of us
5539502 well there are about four of us it wont improve your number greatly but i think we can pull our part
5539503 the sound of anything more than zero is refreshing right now just keep your eyes out for them blindly firing into the clouds from above
5539504 fall in rank and try not to fall out we are better off sticking together than separating too much they have some heavy shielding and the more fire power we can put on them the quicker they fall
5539505 we are green 7 8 9 12 well keep you company until those y wings show up
5539506 then hopefully we can guide them back out into space to take out some of those cruisers we saw as we came in
5539507 jaina called out a distress while we were training so we came as soon as we could
5539508 it was kind of odd to hear from her about this normally we dont hear anything from her
5539509 so we figured it was of much more importance to make it back here than to continue training
5539510 we can tell there are a lot more sarakoth troops out there than we could have ever expected its just odd that we didnt see this coming long ago
5539511 that type of force is hard to miss we could feel their presence as we got closer to yavin
5539512 we havent heard any more about them since we were first informed
5539513 get ready green squad this is the blind fire i was talking about
5539514 they are just toying with us they are aiming at us one at a time and then coming in in hopes of us being disoriented from the loss to easily take out the rest of us
5539515 we already know they will do whatever it takes to win but now they are enjoying the fight
5539516 you sound just like the people that killed your parents
5539517 so im sure they would love to see you now killing innocent people and sinking to the level of their killer
5539518 i already told you that we will not be meeting face to face
5539519 these two will do very well in helping me take you down
5539520 you leave those two boys alone you have done enough to them they dont deserve any more trouble
5539521 it seems as though ive hit a string with you now
5539522 but i have yet to get even with you these two will be mine
5539523 okay we are over the spot left on the map by junior
5539524 are you sure this can be the only place where his ship is
5539525 that would explain why we wouldnt be able to see anything from here
5539526 im going to take her down into that cavern to get a better look
5539527 i cant see at all out there its too dark
5539528 the cavern is too narrow i cant get out ship any closer than here
5539529 we dont even know how deep this thing is and you want to climb over there
5539530 hey i was against coming out here in the first place but you all got me to go im not going to just get this far and not at least come back without rekanis body
5539531 now get suited up we are going to need some cable lines to help us bring him back over here
5539532 we dont need to go fast for any reason so take your time crossing first we are going to jump to that ledge over there and then we can climb over to the ship its not a far jump so dont over think it ill go first
5539533 look at me and only me you can do this
5539534 dont freeze up now you only have a few more feet to go
5539535 its not like you can hang on that cliff face from now on
5539536 you can go get rekani and come back for me then
5539537 im going to need your help in getting him out of here
5539538 stop complaining and come on youve already come more than half way
5539539 now come on i saw an opening over here that we can get in
5539540 hes badly hurt but i cant tell if he is breathing
5539541 thats not enough to survive on if he were moving around but if he has been passed out for a long while now that should be enough to keep him alive
5539542 either way we came here to get him i need your help in getting him out from under this debris
5539543 ill lift this so you can get under there and see if we can move him safely
5539544 but other than his arm he looks like he has sustained a large amount of outside injury
5539545 how are we going to get him back to the ship
5539546 now lets find something that we can tie him to
5539547 we need to pick up the pace before that thing falls and takes us with it
5539548 grab that side we should take him somewhere to warm up

5539556 has had its hand on the pulse of the community and its various needs from tenant advocacy to participation in neighborhood task forces to the development of affordable housing on numerous formerly city owned properties
5539557 hes doing nothing but what any other large real estate developer has done
5539558 the concept was simply to stop the deterioration of the housing stock in harlem and restore it for working class families what you might call the working poor
5539559 one of the things weve learned is that you have to have diverse income levels in a neighborhood
5539560 one should not relegate harlem to housing just for the poor
5539561 but you cant be an icon of the community and not take a certain level of responsibility

5539659 yes yes 15hrs should be fine besides i have this great travel pillow i bought for 50 rupees
5539660 ha ha yes yes electric shower very good for the heart in the morning very good

5539662 de manera oficial como confederaci n de choferes conocemos que la federaci n de santa cruz acatar el paro
5539663 los prefectos ahora marcan la agenda y tienen la iniciativa pol tica por lo tanto los partidos pol ticos podemos espec ficamente se han convertido como espectadores de la pol tica nacional
5539664 institucionalmente es m s importante el senado pero en t rminos de legitimidad y fuerza regional los prefectos sobre todo de santa cruz y beni son importantes sin duda pero que obedecen a proyectos y grupos de inter s muy puntuales
5539665 el estado nunca ha sido un buen administrador y est en juego la confiabilidad del manejo de nuestros recursos y la inversi n que se tenga que hacer de los mismos
5539666 no olvidemos que el comandante general de la polic a gral miguel gemio es una autoridad nacional y el cnl wilgen obleas es un comandante departamental y fueron agredidos alevosamente
5539667 la investigaci n se realiza como a cualquier ciudadano m s aun sin son autores de agresiones f sicas a las autoridades nacionales
5539668 a strange man your enemy exactly like you you know he does not want to die exactly like you
5539669 the film is based on a true story while she was living in hollywood with her husband writer romain gary actress jean seberg brought home a large white dog she had found on the street that seemed friendly and playful however when the animal saw her black gardener it attacked him viciously injuring him afterwards they kept it in the back yard but one day it got out and attacked another black man on the street but no one else after this happened a third time they realized that someone had trained the dog to attack and injure only black people gary wrote a story about it and eventually samuel fuller read it and made it into this movie never released theatrically in the united states supposedly out of concern for its controversial subject matter it did air on hbo several times
5539670 we had been up since five in the morning they the farc asked us to pack our stuff and had us wait all morning telling us they didnt know what was going on
5539671 an hour before the helicopters landed i spoke to farc commander asprilla and he said that we were all going to board the helicopter to go to a place that he didnt know and talk with a farc leader
5539672 when the two white helicopters arrived i have to admit that i felt something strange because usually when we heard helicopters over our heads we had to run fast and hide
5539673 when the people aboard the helicopter came out the deception was total
5539674 we went aboard the helicopter with much difficulty because they had tied our wrists which was humiliating then once we were inside they tied our feet as well they shut the helicopters doors and i saw the farc commander naked on the ground i didnt even feel happy at that moment
5539675 oh ive been listening to him for years and i think hes fabulous
5539676 we are grateful for ms yorks and mr petris many years of dedicated service to the company and we wish them well in their future endeavors
5539677 sei nostro con tutti i vincoli da dipendente ma ti paghiamo con fattura
5539678 manu tu e le chiavi manu tu e i documenti
5539679 se questa la sinistra non c da stupirsi di quello che succede
5539680 when im making a track im trying to capture the sound that makes me go now thats the shit and i want that reaction from everybody who hears it i spend a lot of time in the studio listening to my music through headphones with beats people are finally going to hear it the way they should the way i do
5539681 im so pleased to be here in gallowgate with davena rankin and iain duncan smith to launch our by election campaign for glasgow east
5539682 gallowgate has a very special place in the story of the modern conservative party
5539683 and under iains leadership the social justice poverty group produced two landmark reports breakdown britain and breakthrough britain together they have played a big role in shaping our arguments and policies
5539684 there has been a lot written about this constituency since this by election was called
5539685 that social breakdown is so bad channel 4s dispatches documentary on knife crime found kids here talking about being stabbed as if it was no worse than grazing your knee
5539686 and its important that we learn the lessons from easterhouse from shettleston from gallowgate but today i dont want to focus on the negative or even on glasgow east alone because the social breakdown you can see here is just an extreme version of what you can see everywhere
5539687 with over five million people in our country on out of work benefits many of them on incapacity benefit welfare dependency is now a crisis for the whole country not just this corner of it
5539688 so i dont want to come here to glasgow and make out that this is some uniquely damaged community
5539689 gordon brown wasnt labour supposed to end this degrading poverty
5539690 what is going on with the knife crime and violence on our streets
5539691 yes the conservative party may now be addressing these issues and we like what we hear but what would you actually do
5539692 so lets make it clear in this by election we have a clear mission and a clear plan everything depends on a strong economy so we will rebuild our economy battered by the brown years of reckless spending and borrowing taxing and regulating
5539693 the nhs is our number one priority so we will improve it by ending the top down targets and micro management making doctors answer to patients not politicians strengthening our economy and improving our nhs these are essential tasks for the next conservative government
5539694 but our mission is to repair our broken society to heal the wounds of poverty crime social disorder and deprivation that are steadily making this country a grim and joyless place to live for far too many people
5539695 because while our society is broken today it is not broken for ever we can and will repair it we can and will bring hope and aspiration to places where there is resignation and despair
5539696 whether it is knife crime or any other symptom of our broken society we will repair the damage by treating not just the symptoms but the causes too
5539697 and there is a thread that links it all together the knife crime the worklessness the ill health above all the wasted lives
5539698 a sixteen year old boy stabbed in north london a sixty year old man sitting around in easterhouse whos never had a job a twenty eight year old woman stabbed in south london a forty eight year old woman dying from heart disease in gallowgate
5539699 the thread that links it all together passes yes through family breakdown welfare dependency debt drugs poverty poor policing inadequate housing and failing schools but it is a thread that goes deeper as we see a society that is in danger of losing its sense of personal responsibility social responsibility common decency and yes even public morality
5539700 in this by election campaign we will explain what were planning to do about it
5539701 so first people can expect a conservative government to take tough action to deal with the symptoms of crime and disorder
5539702 so we are proposing that anyone convicted of knife crime should expect to go to jail i dont believe that the governments presumption to prosecute is enough it doesnt send a strong enough signal we need a presumption to prison
5539703 tougher punishment better policing better rehabilitation these are all vital in the fight against knife crime
5539704 that is why we have to be utterly uncompromising on the key social reforms that will together help us repair our broken society
5539705 on school reform we think the current school system must be replaced with a new system that breaks the stranglehold of the educational establishment and gives parents what they want and what their children deserve innovation choice and competition that delivers high standards for everyone everywhere
5539706 on welfare reform we think we need to end the idea that the state gives you money for nothing if you can work you must work we will insist on it and believe me we will stick to our guns when the going gets tough
5539707 and when it comes to perhaps the most important area of all families we will take action not just to support marriage and family stability but on business too to make britain more family friendly
5539708 this is a bold reforming policy agenda but there is more to repairing our broken society than policy and politics
5539709 i think the time has come for me to speak out about something that has been troubling me for a long time i have not found the words to say it sensitively and then i realised that is the whole point
5539710 instead we prefer moral neutrality a refusal to make judgments about what is good and bad behaviour right and wrong behaviour bad good right wrong these are words that our political system and our public sector scarcely dare use any more
5539711 of course as soon as a politician says this there is a clamour
5539712 our relationships crack up our marriages break down we fail as parents and as citizens just like everyone else
5539713 of course circumstances where you are born your neighbourhood your school and the choices your parents make have a huge impact but social problems are often the consequence of the choices that people make
5539714 there is a danger of becoming quite literally a de moralised society where nobody will tell the truth anymore about what is good and bad right and wrong
5539715 and why would a different government be any different not least because we understand that the causes of our broken society lie not just in government policies but in our national culture
5539716 changing our culture is not easy or quick you cannot pull a lever you cannot do it top down but you can give a lead you can give a nudge you can make a difference if you are clear where you stand
5539717 imagine if there was a government that understood really understood that encouraging personal and social responsibility must be the cornerstone of everything that it did and that every move it took re inforced that view
5539718 saying to parents your responsibility and your commitment matters so we will give a tax break for marriage and end the couple penalty
5539719 it is the responsibility agenda and it will be the defining thread of any government i lead
5539720 above all i believe that this cultural change needs to start at home the values we need to repair our broken society and to build a strong society are values that should be taught in the home in the family
5539721 that is why i have put the family right at the heart of my programme action on knife crime better policing and criminal justice reform reforming schools reforming welfare these are all vital components of the social reform we need so urgently
5539722 but in the end the state cannot do it all in the end the best regulation is self regulation not state regulation thats why the family comes first thats where we can really turn things around and start to repair our broken society
5539723 my focus on social reform does not mean for one second that i dont believe the next conservative government wont have urgent work to do to rebuild our economy or improve our nhs but the nature of the changes will be different in those areas
5539724 it is in social policy that we mean to be most bold and radical and for that i need a mandate i need to make clear today the scale of our ambition so that everyone knows what they will be voting for at the next election
5539725 i want a mandate for restoring responsibility to our society a mandate to call time on the twisted values that have eaten away at our social fabric a mandate for tough action to repair our broken society
5539726 i forgot about this problem winrar or winzip have but when you unrar or unzip something with a long file name it reads it as corrupt
5539727 the spirit of encroachment tends to consolidate the powers of all the departments in one and thus to create whatever the form of government a real despotism a just estimate of the love of power and proneness to abuse it which predominates in the human heart is sufficient to satisfy us of the truth of this proposition
5539728 all the powers of government legislative executive and judiciary result to the legislative body the concentrating of these in the same hands is precisely the definition of despotic government
5539729 belasting is diefstal belastingontwijking loont voor ondernemers en consultants met een winst boven 20 000 euro meer weten haags juristen college nl
5539730 door het heffen van belasting als diefstal te bestempelen wordt een verkeerde moraal bevorderd waarbij het normaal wordt gevonden niet zelf bij te dragen aan de samenleving waarvan men zelf profiteert
5539731 je kunt hoog of laag springen maar belasting is en blijft gelegaliseerde roof
5539732 dat is allemaal al erg genoeg maar nu wordt ons ook nog van hogerhand het recht ontnomen om daarover onze mening te ventileren dit is ordinaire censuur
5539733 niet alleen worden we gedwongen de helft van wat we verdienen af te dragen dat geld wordt vervolgens ook nog eens gebruikt om ons de mond te snoeren als we tegen deze gelegaliseerde roof bezwaar wensen aan te tekenen
5539734 maar je moet toch iets wij van het haags juristen college gaan in elk geval moedig voorwaarts met onze strijd
5539735 it is so difficult to win against them like this they are perfect nobody is going to beat them
5539736 we had a supposedly closed scrimmage on saturday and some of our people brought in little blog sites that said we saw this and we saw that
5539737 our coaches work hard on what were trying to prepare and would rather not have their thoughts and ideas and game plans out there kicked around until they get to showcase them
5539738 some who come abuse the situation some people come and all of a sudden it becomes an ebay thing and the people who are here with their youngster who would just love to have a james laurinaitis signature kind of get nudged out of the way by the folks that are trying to use james signature for their own gain
5539739 when things get a little bit abused and out of control you have to control them
5539740 anytime that we have a chance to provide an opportunity for our fans to come in with no cost its as good a deal as it can possibly be
5539741 we hope that some folks who dont necessarily get here all the time because we know how hard it is to get tickets have a chance to come
5539742 its a thank you to the fans but its also the fans thank you to us
5539743 we are working very hard to make mobileme a great service we can all be proud of
5539744 we know that mobilemes launch has not been our finest hour and we truly appreciate your patience as we turn this around
5539745 the mac to mobileme transition was a lot rockier than we had hoped but everything is now up and running
5539746 president bush began an intensive effort today to sell his plan for developing new sources of energy to congress and the american people arguing that the country had a future of energy abundance if it could break free of the traditional antagonism between energy producers and environmental advocates mr bushs plea for a new dialogue came as his administration published the report of an energy task force containing scores of specific proposals for finding new sources of power and encouraging a range of new energy technologies
5539747 mentions about a dozen areas including land use restrictions in the rockies lease stipulations on offshore areas attractive to oil companies the vetting of locations for nuclear plants environmental reviews to upgrade power plants and refineries that could be streamlined or eliminated to help industry find more oil and gas and produce more electricity and gasoline
5539748 this great country could face a darker future a future that is unfortunately being previewed in rising prices at the gas pump and rolling blackouts in the great state of california
5539749 mr bush talked not only of blackouts but of blackmail raising the specter of a future in which the united states is increasingly vulnerable to foreign oil suppliers mr bush was praised by many groups for laying out a long term energy policy his report contained 105 initiatives
5539750 world supplies are adequate and reasonably stable price fluctuations are cyclical reserves are plentiful
5539751 exaggerated claims seem designed to promote some long frustrated ambitions of the oil industry at the expense of environmental quality
5539752 senator mccains proposal is bold its aggressive its an all of the above approach
5539753 senator obama has taken a very minimalist or none of the above or very few of the above approaches
5539754 pawlenty has called for a civil and respectful campaign and yet virtually every time i turn on the television set i see ads that are on the part of mccain that are grossly misleading
5539755 i personally believe that if barack obama gets elected he will slam the door shut on these options
5539756 if senator mccain is elected he will open the door to these options and allow our energy supply to be increased and take some of the pressure off our energy crisis in the country
5539757 midwesterners like authenticity and not someone who is phony or too glitzy senator mccain is authentic and if you look at how his issues line up with mainstream voters they line up more closely than barack obamas do all of those things are going to serve him well in the midwest

5539760 a ho hum speaker who couldnt capture the attention of the conventioneers
5539761 what an irksome task the writing of long letters is
5539762 the last line of defense in support of freedom and the constitution consists of the people themselves if the people want to be free if they want to lift themselves out from underneath a state apparatus that threatens their liberties squanders their resources on needless wars destroys the value of their dollar and spews forth endless propaganda about how indispensable it is and how lost we would all be without it there is no force that can stop them
5539763 we have not quite hit the critical mass that will make social networking self reinforcing
5539764 managing an appropriate balance between freedom and control is crucial to community growth and maintenance and must be tuned continuously
5539765 obviously given my background in financial services we are looking at ways you could use financial services with social networking
5539766 social networking is any network of people who have common interests so you could imagine a network of investors or network of investment professionals who want to share ideas using a social network
5539767 the interesting thing is you can get targeting and reach through a social network whereas you usually have to trade off one or the other you either have a lot of reach or not much targeting or you have got really good targeting or not much reach you actually have the best of both worlds
5539768 yes id like to be painted by someone whose dealer describes as the most prestigious portrait painter of the century although less than five minutes of clear thinking clearly tells you that he is in fact not
5539769 the mans obviously a fruitcake but his dealer calls him the most prestigious portrait painter of the century and she hyperbole aside is clearly no fool
5539770 kind of dark and moody like the work ive been involved in

5539802 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
5539803 whether i win or lose the impeachment the nation will lose
5539804 weve said for years that musharraf is our best bet and my fear is that we are about to discover how true that was
5539805 they have one policy for domestic consumption have peace dont use the army
5539806 president bush appreciates president musharrafs efforts in the democratic transition of pakistan as well as his commitment to fighting al qaeda and extremist groups
5539807 im angry so much that i want to get revenge
5539808 its just like living in iraq terrorist town thats how i see it bunch of terrorists here
5539809 these types of cowardly acts are hideous and there are a lot of community members that are fed up with it
5539810 people are saying what can we do to make it right
5539811 it is up to us the four nations people we need to work together to come up with long term solutions against the gangs the drugs and the violence but our community has to take charge
5539812 hello kitty deve morire hello kitty deve morire e tutti lo possono ammazzare
5539813 there are two directions you can go with this research
5539814 some might say this suggests that parents should have their kids attend places of worship or if we use it to help explain why religious participation has a positive effect on academics parents who arent interested in attending church can consider how to structure their kids time to allow access to the same beneficial social networks and opportunities religious institutions provide
5539815 for typical teens in the study the probability of dropping out of high school for those who attend religious services and youth activities at least once a week is 05
5539816 for teens who never attend services the probability is 084 over 60 percent greater
5539817 we know roughly half of american teens regularly participate in some kind of religious organization
5539818 so its important to understand what aspects of religious involvement can benefit adolescents in order to enhance their school success during a difficult but critical period of development
5539819 i did give documents a long time ago but these matters have been resolved for a long time now as far as im concerned
5539820 keep that faith keep your courage stick together stay strong do not yield do not flinch stand up were americans and well never surrender
5539821 i probably should have mentioned what you all already know these are tough times
5539822 he was compelled as a matter of honour to turn up to the forum and explain himself to the leaders it is very disappointing that he wont turn up to effectively take his medicine
5539823 i think it speaks volumes that theyre not prepared to come and be accountable to forum leaders i think leaders are very keen to see the commitments that were made last time adhered to
5539824 some of our competitors are struggling to keep output levels up bp rio and shell are struggling to stay where they are
5539825 ive been a little surprised that there have not been more deals it is getting more difficult to find new resources in minerals metals and oil so i see more consolidation over the next couple of years scale is very important when you need to produce things more cheaply
5539826 chinas economy is driven by domestic demand and we are quite confident about the long term
5539827 the politicization of energy is only beneficial to those running for office
5539828 if our national leadership cannot come to grips with a problem of this severity theres something wrong with the process and the people
5539829 every time the price drops americans just say ok the problem is solved
5539830 just having prices ease up a little bit at the pump did not solve the problem
5539831 well be right back to the pump price that made you uncomfortable originally
5539832 its unrealistic to suggest that alternatives are right around the corner when the infrastructure is not there
5539833 thats different than a two to four year election cycle
5539834 women and cats will do as they please and men and dogs should relax and get used to the idea
5539835 our family of six some picky eaters pulled into dillard at dinnertime and found the menu to be to everyones liking the food was fresh delicious varied hot and in astonishing quantity five meats eight or nine vegetables several salads four breads and more than enough dessert offerings especially good were the acorn squash souffle and creamed cabbage the dishes of food kept coming one more and theyd have had to stack it on
5539836 several roadfood com members visited the dillard house early in august 2006 we found the description written a couple of years ago by michael stern to be spot on we enjoyed a dinner and the next days breakfast and both lived up to the great review written earlier the dinner vegetables are all garden grown locally we loved the butternut squash and asparagus as well as the fresh melons and tomatoes dinner meats were as described
5539837 heres a look at what was left after six hungry people went to work on a dillard house dinner
5539838 it feels so good knowing people appreciate all the hard work hes been doing
5539839 to hear that cheer and to feel the support the people have built on you its weird because you think that once they get to know me theyll get annoyed by me its neat to see that they really appreciate what you are doing
5539840 once they get to know me theyll get annoyed by me
5539841 were approaching a pull the plug kind of decision this is like a last stand for webcasting
5539842 were taking this challenge very seriously when we have our board meetings the central topic is the revenue trajectory not how happy our users are
5539843 theyre not going to chase a company whose business model has been broken so if it doesnt feel like its headed towards a solution were done
5539844 were losing money as it is the moment we think this problem in washington is not going to get solved we have to pull the plug because all were doing is wasting money

5539855 no son soluciones de fondo pero colaboran para resolver un poco la situaci n que se est planteando y que es la falta de viviendas que es un tema que viene desde hace muchos a os
5539856 no solo con la compra y urbanizaci n de tierras se resuelve la situaci n de los vecinos que es lo m s importante sino tambi n con otras medidas que sirven tambi n para el mantenimiento de la propiedad de aquellos que realmente lo necesitan
5539857 en este contexto y con ese sentido nos encontramos trabajando actualmente
5539858 se han detectado problemas con cierta frecuencia especialmente en chacra xi y es la comercializaci n que se da de los lotes despu s de su adjudicaci n sabemos que han habido varias ventas concretamente y en realidad todos sabemos que son lotes que se entregan para dar cumplimiento a un fin social para aquellas familias que no tienen un predio
5539859 pero hay algunos que hacen alg n tipo de operaci n comercial utilizando la mec nica de construir una mejora en el lote y despu s lo que se hace es vender esta mejora pero en realidad lo que se est haciendo es una venta del lote
5539860 es asegurar que se cumpla el fin para el cual han sido creadas estas urbanizaciones y es resolver la falta de tierras de muchos vecinos
5539861 hemos puesto algunas condiciones que b sicamente consisten en la prohibici n de venta del terreno si bien esto ya estaba establecido pero en este caso hacemos la salvedad de que si se quiere vender la mejora porque por ah se puede presentar alg n caso de fuerza mayor por ejemplo una familia que tenga que irse de la ciudad o de la provincia se puede vender solicitando autorizaci n a la direcci n de tierras municipales pero solo a alguna persona del listado de postulantes que en este momento tiene alrededor de unos cinco mil inscriptos
5539862 de este modo nos aseguramos que el vecino que compre la tierra sea una persona que verdaderamente est anotado en tierras y est necesitando resolver su problema habitacional y no alguien que ya tiene tierras y lo compra como una inversi n para alquilar por ejemplo
5539863 todo va en la misma l nea y apunta a resolver y a descomprimir un poco la situaci n de la falta de viviendas
5539864 tiene un proyecto que lo va a estar girando en muy poco tiempo al concejo deliberante y que tiene que ver con el canje de algunas tierras que tiene la municipalidad con un privado de la zona y como consecuencia de ese canje poder tener quince hect reas m s para urbanizar y que son aproximadamente unos cuatrocientos lotes los que vienen muy bien para resolver la situaci n complicada que estamos atravesando en lo que respecta al h bitat social
5539865 una solicitud de endeudamiento u obtenci n de fondos a nivel nacional o lo que fuere para poder realizar la obra del colector cloacal que va a ir paralelo a la circunvalaci n para evacuar todos los efluentes de la zona de chacra xi xii y xiii es decir el tri ngulo que est comprendido entre complementaria c ruta 3 y circunvalaci n que es el que de mantenerse el actual ritmo de crecimiento de la ciudad ser el que se urbanizar completamente
5539866 obviamente esto tambi n ser tratado en el concejo deliberante y lo hemos visto con agrado por lo que ya hemos expresado nuestra adhesi n a esta obra
5539867 el adjudicatario de un predio fiscal o municipal deber hacer ocupaci n efectiva del mismo y no podr bajo ninguna circunstancia realizar locaciones y o comodato ni de las mejoras que en el hubiere hasta el otorgamiento del t tulo de propiedad siendo este motivo causa suficiente para que se proceda a la desadjudicaci n del predio
5539868 el adjudicatario desistiera de la titularidad del predio asignado y no poseyera el t tulo de propiedad respectivo deber comunicar por escrito tal situaci n a la autoridad de aplicaci n para proceder a la desadjudicaci n cuyo dominio volver a la municipalidad reintegrando al ex adjudicatario el importe que en concepto de precio haya abonado por el mismo el monto a reintegrar por el municipio ser igual al total de lo abonado hasta ese momento deduci ndole de este importe el diez por ciento 10 en concepto de gastos administrativos el reintegro se realizar al contado o en igual cantidad de cuotas seg n el sistema que haya adoptado oportunamente el ex adjudicatario para efectuar el pago del predio
5539869 ive been doing this for 26 years and this is the best job ive ever had
5539870 a real piece of work i love that girl shes been behind the scenes of every single republican victory in the past 30 years and shes still the least self aggrandizing person youll ever meet
5539871 a real pro and a lot of fun to work with she gets things done and can cut through the bull pretty quickly
5539872 this is not for the 25 000 people in the hall its for hundreds of millions of people who are watching it its just like the olympics your show has to be flowing
5539873 this is going to be a whole lot different than this place has seen before
5539874 my late father told me it didnt matter i was short but id always be heard
5539875 theres no position she hasnt had in government so i dont know what else she could do
5539876 theres no question shell take a respite but i dont think theres any question shell get back in the political saddle
5539877 barefoot or as close to it as you can get is best
5539878 my perception of england is totally different now this is not the england i was told about and i would advise any doctor thinking of coming and working here to think twice
5539879 although i have received no abuse on the hospital grounds every other day since i moved to the area i have got the odd comment about the way i look but nothing like this
5539880 im trying to move not only out of this area but out of the country my wife says she does not feel safe here and wants to get out as soon as possible
5539881 she feels there is no guarantee that this wont happen again
5539882 i have friends across the world in america canada and the middle east none of them have had this happen to them
5539883 it began with comments like where is your mosque and we are paying for your taxes to be here soon it deteriorated with more racial abuse like you black bastard i am sikh and peoples ignorance here is beyond belief
5539884 i thought this was nonsense as i am a highly skilled professional and it was not difficult for them to see i was a doctor i had a stethoscope and a hospital badge on my jacket
5539885 little do these people know that my wife and i pay over 10 000 in taxes and national insurance to live and work here
5539886 soon one of them said we will kill your family if you dont move out we know where you live and then he headbutted me
5539887 both of these blogs should be cut immediately from the list of credentialed sites neither functions as a responsible media outlet and both offend muslims as well as others to allow them access to the democratic national convention sends a message to muslims they will not forget we look for leah daughtry ceo of the convention to nix them asap
5539888 i am disturbed to see that count chocula has aged look at those crows feet i always figured he was a chocopire and didn t age as long as he could drink the sweet brown nectar of life
5539889 ways to kill a chocopire include drenching with holy water stabbing with a wooden stake exposing to sunlight and eating with milk the milk has no known mystical properties but it does wash down the choco unholiness admirably

5539891 nuestro principal objetivo es que los chicos de las escuelas a quienes ya hemos invitado puedan acercarse a trav s de estas actividades y tengan un acercamiento a la ciencia y a la tecnolog a
5539892 puedan perder el miedo a los t rminos de la ciencia que tienen que ver con nuestra vida cotidiana y que conozcan los avances cient ficos y t cnicos que vemos a diario a nivel nacional e internacional
5539893 varias las escuelas p blicas y privadas que nos han manifestado su entusiasmo en sumarse a la iniciativa

5539906 at outskirts press we never want our authors to feel like theyre in this business alone our new self publishing news blog is one more way we support all writers before during and after publication
5539907 at the same time we envision the self publishing news blog as a place to recognize the vast accomplishments of our outskirts press authors specifically including awards and marketing triumphs
5539908 plans to extend 3s 3g network mean that our customers will be able to access their 3g services in far more places and with the appetite for services like the internet on the mobile growing rapidly it makes good sense
5539909 in addition to providing more access to our 3g services these initiatives will reduce our roaming costs both new sites being added and lower wholesale roaming costs will have a significant impact
5539910 on a beaucoup critiqu la chine mais il ny a rien dire je trouve les infrastructures fabuleuses tout est hyper organis le plus dur pour les sportifs ici cest la chaleur humide sans courant dair le mental compte norm ment

5539925 pacific blue and virgin blue we expect those to beprofitable
5539926 enables clever propaganda inflammatory opinions half truths and untruths to circulate freely and gain currency
5539927 from our perspective this government is clearly pursuing some wrong priorities so weve taken the decision to oppose measures that we frankly dont believe are in the national interest
5539928 we are concerned it has the potential to compound the problem of alcohol abuse in young and not so young australians
5539929 dr nelson needs to explain what impact his opposition to this measure will have on the health of young people and the sorts of outcomes we are trying to achieve for the community in making sure that young people have a healthier approach to the way they consume alcohol
5539930 if the liberal party are about to put their hands up to maintain a tax exemption or a special tax treatment for this category of alcoholic drinks which is specifically targeted at young girls the question i want to know is what do they believe the binge drinking rate will become on young girls in the future once they take this action
5539931 to maintain a tax exemption or a special tax treatment for this category of alcoholic drinks which is specifically targeted at young girls

5539935 a salada ideol gica resulta da leitura de resumos dos grandes pensadores
5539936 repetir meia d zia de slogans muito mais f cil do que estudar e ler grandes obras por isso a ideologiza o mais comum onde impera a ignor ncia

5539945 if youre going to kill each other do it outside i just finished cleaning
5539946 you better pray that will come out of the carpet
5539947 if you dont straighten up im going to knock you into the middle of next week
5539948 if you fall out of that swing and break your neck youre not going to the store with me
5539949 make sure you wear clean underwear in case youre in an accident
5539950 keep crying and ill give you something to cry about
5539951 will you look at that dirt on the back of your neck
5539952 this room of yours looks as if a tornado went through it
5539953 if i told you once ive told you a million times dont exaggerate
5539954 i brought you into this world and i can take you out
5539955 there are millions of less fortunate children in this world who dont have wonderful parents like you do
5539956 you are going to get it when you get home
5539957 if you dont stop crossing your eyes they are going to freeze that way
5539958 put your sweater on dont you think i know when you are cold
5539959 when that lawn mower cuts off your toes dont come running to me
5539960 if you dont eat your vegetables youll never grow up
5539961 shut that door behind you do you think you were born in a barn
5539962 undoubtedly this is a symptom of the global credit crunch
5539963 record losses from the subprime fallout and rising delinquencies have squeezed issuers credit so tight theyre tapping out add that to the fact that consumers credit is already stretched and youre left with a tough market for credit card issuers
5539964 he was the right guy with the right background and right tenure
5539965 i think we are soul mates in terms of our ethics and how we treat our employees and our clients
5539966 we are still dominated by our brokerage and management activity
5539967 he made a poor choice he made a wrong choice
5539968 there is only one way to cut taxes and to keep them going down and that is to keep this conservative government in office
5539969 i have never felt more hopeful or confident about our future
5539970 we have broken the liberal lock on power we demonstrated to canadians that there is a better way to govern this country and weve watched canada on a conservative path to a future of unlimited possibilities
5539971 youll never know what can happen but the official election date is october 2009
5539972 i think its time the federal parliament set a date for an election rather than this guessing
5539973 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
5539974 seoul shares are taking blows from renewed worries aboutu s credit market fears with a foreigners selloff pulling theindex back sharply
5539975 meanwhile chinese stock markets steep losses since theolympics are also denting sentiment towards heavy industry issuesin steelmaking and shipbuilding sectors there are worries thatchinese economy may not grow as robustly after the olympics
5539976 interest fines penalties or other assessments that may be imposed
5539977 if the government is willing to agree to such a small amount the likelihood of wellcare being put out of business because of this investigation seems remote
5539978 it would be possible to know that nothing has even happened
5539979 it would be possible to not know what has happened elsewhere
5539980 the damages and costs ordered by the court are significant and should act as a deterrent
5539981 this shows that taking direct steps against infringers is an important and effective weapon in the battle against online piracy
5539982 it was always intended that there would be a lot more
5539983 this is a proper intellectual property ip court that has made this judgement
5539984 the previous ones were default judgements where defendants never turned up
5539985 i do not get any sense that theres been any fundamental shift in the desire to litigate
5539986 an open court process with a full report is certainly preferable to justice of the type being mooted by the government on p2p where activity takes place behind closed doors through industry action
5539987 we see it as a place where we can share with you our companys collective insights opinions and perspectives on all things related to scea playstation and the industry we play in
5539988 activison is forced to play nicely with the other games and not force people to pay to use their instruments on competitions games

5539990 i probably got my size from my moms side of the family he said with a laugh
5539991 coming in as a rookie i didnt really know what to expect learning a new defense having to play a new technique it was all new to me
5539992 when you can beat an offensive lineman like that you feel great mcdonald said
5539993 and to get a sack at the end of it is an even bigger plus
5539994 being able to bring continued advances to our high capacity reliable enterprise class storage solutions is critically important to our customers who are managing exploding volumes of increasingly valuable data
5539995 by working closely with other world class technology providers such as the tape engineers at fujifilm our new one terabyte drive is bringing the next generation to market today
5539996 fujifilm continues to supply reliable high capacity media for these mission critical data center back up solutions based on our nanocubic technology
5539997 with the volume of digitized data accelerating over the next decade and the increased need for secure encrypted storage for healthcare and financial compliance regulations the industry must continue to develop solutions for the storage management transport and recovery of highly valuable data
5539998 recognition of the utility of stable isotope studies now spans applications as diverse as carbon water cycle environmental studies animal migration tracking and human metabolic pathway research full exploitation of this potential requires easy and fast access to high quality isotope ratio data but has been limited by the high cost and practical constraints of existing mass spectrometry tools we believe the advent of turn key cost effective instruments that require no special training or sample handling is going to completely revolutionize this field and more importantly significantly expand the number of practical applications for stable isotope measurements
5539999 based on its performance in our laboratory i truly feel this new instrument has the potential to transform the way the analytical world measures water isotopes
