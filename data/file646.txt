6460120 and coming up right now is jamie adam and marcus they will be entertaining us with a little lip syncopation from the blockbuster movie
6460121 were going to take it up a notch for all you ladies out there
6460122 i believe that its our destiny to win the gold both teams deserve to be in the final but i think we will be the ones who end up as the champions
6460123 were really confident but well just have to wait and see argentina have the likes of lionel messi sergio aguero juan riquelme and javier mascherano in their squad they will give us a hard match
6460124 its not going to be easy for them we have some great individual players and the coach has moulded us into a team
6460125 we have only conceded three goals during this tournament for me our best performance was against belgium but we want to be at our peak for the final match
6460126 its a sweet feeling to know that the hard work before and during the competition has taken us to the final

6460133 the venerable biblical tradition of sacred scr pture known as the old testament displays a series of divine appellations among which is the sacred name of god revealed in a tetragrammaton yhwh hwhw
6460134 the greek translation of the old testament the so called septuagint dating back to the last centuries prior to the christian era had regularly rendered the hebrew tetragrammaton with the greek word kyrios which means lord since the text of the septuagint constituted the bible of the first generation of greek speaking christians in which language all the books of the new testament were also written these christians too from the beginning never pronounced the divine tetragrammaton
6460135 when in fact st paul with regard to the crucifixion writes that god has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name which is above every name

6460137 the title in fact becomes interchangeable between the god of israel and the messiah of the christian faith even though it is not in fact one of the titles used for the messiah of israel

6460224 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
6460225 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6460226 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6460227 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
6460228 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6460229 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables

6460233 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6460234 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6460235 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6460236 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6460237 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6460238 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6460239 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6460240 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6460241 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6460242 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6460243 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6460244 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica

6460246 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
6460247 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
6460248 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura

6460250 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6460251 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6460252 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6460253 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6460254 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6460255 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6460256 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6460257 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6460258 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6460259 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6460260 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6460261 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6460262 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6460263 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6460264 making clothes is a similar process to making a movie it is a very sacred and profane thing sometimes the world of my imagination and vision becomes frayed and broken down chaotic and corrupt the stillness sunk beneath loud vibration and noise its a sharp and metallic industrial mayhem

6460266 sustainable pro poor growth yet overwhelmingly the problem of the bottom billion has not been that they have had the wrong type of growth it is that they have not had any growth
6460267 one of the best short interventions into the so called culture wars
6460268 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6460269 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6460270 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana

6460274 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6460275 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6460276 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6460277 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6460278 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6460279 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6460280 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6460281 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6460282 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6460283 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6460284 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6460285 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6460286 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6460287 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6460288 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6460289 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6460290 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6460291 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
6460292 convening parliament is a violation is a repudiation of some of the conditions
6460293 president mugabe will not proceed to do anything unilaterally that any step that we take has to be by consensus
6460294 if president mugabe proceeds to convene parliament appoint a new cabinet it means that he is proceeding to violate the conditions which means that he may have abandoned the basis for the talks but we dont know what his intentions are
6460295 that while negotiations are continuing it may be necessary to convene parliament to give effect to the will of the people as expressed in the parliamentary elections held
6460296 how do you share not only responsibility but also authority over government
6460297 how do you distinguish between head of state and head of government without necessarily defining anyone as ceremonial it is not envisaged that the president becomes ceremonial on the other hand it is not envisaged that you have got a ceremonial prime minister
6460298 it is that balance that is necessary to establish and i think thats where the outstanding issue is
6460299 the un country team has taken an overly cautious approach in its dealings with the government and has failed to develop a coherent and systematic response to the ongoing displacement crisis in zimbabwe
6460300 impress upon the government of zimbabwe its responsibility to protect the rights of zimbabweans who have become displaced
6460301 the leading international body monitoring conflict induced internal displacement worldwide
6460302 the main character is you if you were a zombie raising slayer
6460303 if we had some ham we could have some ham and eggs if we had some eggs
6460304 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6460305 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6460306 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6460307 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6460308 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6460309 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6460310 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6460311 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6460312 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6460313 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6460314 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6460315 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6460316 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6460317 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6460318 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6460319 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6460320 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6460321 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior

6460324 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6460325 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6460326 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6460327 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6460328 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
6460329 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
6460330 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6460331 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6460332 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo

6460339 i think in most cases they were just given to people who shouldnt have gotten loans
6460340 a lot of these homes are going to be deeply underwater when the monthly mortgage payment shoots up and there will be a very strong incentive for people to just walk away from their homes

6460380 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6460381 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6460382 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6460383 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6460384 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6460385 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones

6460421 the president expressed his sympathies to the people of pakistan for the recent terrorist attacks that have killed so many innocents

6460423 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
6460424 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6460425 every single one of those quotations came from the campaign of 1960 when the republicans attacked john fitzgerald kennedy
6460426 we suffer from a fiscal cancer it is growing inside us

6460437 maybe i wasnt cut out to be a fundraiser after all
6460438 surely you can resolve this in a way that wont alienate our best donor and jeopardize our campaign
6460439 i hired you as a senior manager just do it
6460440 here are people who would understand and even if they dont have the answers they might at least listen to me and let me explore my ideas with them at best maybe they even have some suggestions
6460441 could you meet for coffee afterwards so i can talk to you
6460442 what would you do about a donor such as max
6460443 we should outline a list of warning signs of a no win job
6460444 thanks my friends and colleagues for giving me ideas on how to handle my problem situation now how about if we pool our ideas once again and help our other colleagues by developing guidelines for what to look for when interviewing for a job
6460445 first we divide the amount of energy that the reactor produces 2 500 megawatts by the nameplate rating of the wind turbine which is 1
6460446 now let us look at the amount of land area that would be needed for these 6 668 wind turbines
6460447 to figure the spacing of the wind turbines let us multiply the rotor diameter of 77 meters by 3 which gives us 231 meters as the spacing between the wind turbines
6460448 if we multiply 231 by 385 it will give us the total area required to site one of our 1 5 mw wind turbines this comes out to 88 935 square meters or 22 acres of land for one 1 5 mw wind turbine if we now multiply the 22 acres by the 6 668 wind turbines we get 146 696 acres which is 229 21 square miles about three times the size of the metropolitan washington d c area so it appears that it will take 146 696 acres of land covered with wind turbines to have a part time generating capability equivalent to that achieved on 4 000 acres of land for the nuclear power plant which includes a lake used to provide water to the cooling towers
6460449 wind energy advocates purposely confuse the availability factor and the capacity factor in their promotional materials to try to demonstrate that a certain number of wind turbines can produce the same energy as a nuclear power plant in truth although the availability factor of the wind turbine is 100 because it is available to produce power at any time wind turbines actually produce power less than 25 of the time and that is only when the wind blows compare this to the nuclear power plant in which the availability factor and the capacity factor are the same about 95 the only time the nuclear reactor is not producing power is during maintenance periods
6460450 it has been confirmed that gail kim is indeed through with tna tis the season
6460451 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6460452 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6460453 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6460454 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6460455 call last week for americans to break their addiction to oil
6460456 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
6460457 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
6460458 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
6460459 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
6460460 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
6460461 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
6460462 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
6460463 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
6460464 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
6460465 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
6460466 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
6460467 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
6460468 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
6460469 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
6460470 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
6460471 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
6460472 if we use their tactics well lose the moral high ground
6460473 a general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor
6460474 my electrical meter should be standing still or going backwards
6460475 the system will offset their electrical bill by about 80 percent
6460476 it will stabilize their bill and shield them from the unknown of future edison rate increases
6460477 it will offset 537 000 miles driven by the average car
6460478 thats about eliminating 21 500 miles driven per year its like taking 1 7 cars off the road for 25 years and planting 2 8 acres of trees

6460484 half of dems nationwide agree that hillarys act of putting her name in nomination you know that heinous scheming act at the heart of hillarys plot to steal the convention for herself think it will help unify the party only 28 disagree
6460485 i believe her testimony could have changed the course of history now others believed that she would hurt anita hill
6460486 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6460487 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
6460488 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
6460489 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
6460490 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
6460491 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6460492 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
6460493 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
6460494 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
6460495 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
6460496 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
6460497 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
6460498 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
6460499 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
6460500 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
6460501 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
6460502 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
6460503 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
6460504 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
6460505 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
6460506 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
6460507 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
6460508 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
6460509 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
6460510 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet

6460514 our statewide network of information professionals has worked diligently with national strategic partners to put together a first class service we believe will be of tremendous assistance to indiana businesses of all sizes
6460515 were extremely pleased to offer this free economic development tool to businesses throughout the state
6460516 new sessions for the web based programs run every month and last six weeks
6460517 the courses are really designed with the best interest of the student allowing them to set their own pace

6460520 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
6460521 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful

6460523 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
6460524 20 wind by 2030 increasing wind energy contribution to u s electric supply
6460525 would be accomplished solely through private investment with no new customer or corporate taxes or government regulation
6460526 in 1999 2001 and 2003 when congress temporarily killed the credits the number of new turbines dropped dramatically
6460527 tuesdays event illustrates the inherent challenges associated with using wind energy because the wind sometimes stops blowing without a moments notice engineers at ercot must remain nimble enough to respond to resulting instability on the grid
6460528 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
6460529 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
6460530 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
6460531 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
6460532 trust me i have the inside dope that obvious thing that everyone already knows is true
6460533 i cant believe i actually miss jonah goldberg in tnr
6460534 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6460535 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6460536 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
6460537 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
6460538 for a lot of people who have health insurance they are paying more for health care but it may not show up as concretely as paying 70 to fill their gas tank
6460539 college costs health care costs and energy costs are up and income is down
6460540 any one of those subjects touches a raw nerve for the middle class in this country im seeing it in race after race
6460541 the issue of health care may be getting less attention than it deserves from the media but its still a top concern for voters and among the top issues that sen obama talks about on the campaign trail
6460542 there is a stark contrast in the way both candidates would address the issue because the views on providing affordability accessibility and portability of health care are so divergent it could hardly escape the conversation each candidate will have with voters
6460543 if people had to pass that many signs that announced how much health care costs you can bet it would be at the top of the agenda
6460544 it is strikingly different from 2000 when gore spent 60 percent of the time at most events talking about health care
6460545 when its hard living on a 500 per month fixed income hard to pay the light bill pay for natural gas go to town and buy gasoline thats when it hits home
6460546 we know that here in south carolina we have a disparity in health care
6460547 we have to bring in communities that will be more affected make them part of the decision making
6460548 why do you need us to join the climate debate are you saying because i am black i am not involved already or that you need more useful victims for your cause agenda
6460549 it becomes evident that while discussing climate we are not witnessing a clash of views about the environment but a clash of views about human freedom
6460550 as someone who lived under communism for most of my life i feel obliged to say that the biggest threat to freedom democracy the market economy and prosperity at the beginning of the 21st century is not communism or its various softer variants
6460551 why do so many people who subscribe to the belief in global warming also subscribe to the leftist liberal viewpoint on so many matters why does this belief appeal to those that have a certain political view
6460552 what does a cane toad and salt water intrusion have to do with global warming see you liberals just flip and spin flip and spin obama is an expert at it
6460553 wir werden es sicher bei einem test w hrend der saison einsetzen allerdings sicher nicht beim kommenden monza test denn der wird ganz im zeichen des monza pakets stehen

6460559 my ultimate idea of success that i havent achieved yet would be for the artistic projects to sustain me financially
6460560 but if i can spend my creative energies on projects that make me happy being part of the mechanism that moves culture forward thats success
6460561 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
6460562 they told me there are going to be resources here
6460563 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
6460564 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
6460565 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
6460566 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
6460567 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
6460568 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
6460569 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
6460570 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
6460571 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6460572 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6460573 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6460574 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6460575 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6460576 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6460577 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6460578 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6460579 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6460580 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6460581 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6460582 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6460583 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6460584 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6460585 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6460586 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6460587 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6460588 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6460589 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6460590 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
6460591 after my release i do not intend to return to the oil industry
6460592 i intend to engage in humanitarian activities and dedicate myself to my family

6460597 this storm is turning into a serious catastrophic flooding event particularly in southern brevard county
6460598 some areas could see rainfall of as much as 30 inches
6460599 slight strengthening is still possible while the center of fay remains over water but gradual weakening is forecast after fay moves back over the florida peninsula
6460600 is expected to produce rainfall accumulations over the next 36 hours of five to 10 inches 13 to 25 centimeters

6460606 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6460607 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6460608 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
6460609 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6460610 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6460611 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
6460612 drivers have responded very well to our initial promotions with natalie

6460615 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
6460616 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
6460617 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
6460618 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
6460619 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming
6460620 well i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade

6460623 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list

6460637 will be down and out for a couple of days
6460638 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6460639 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6460640 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6460641 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000

6460658 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature

6460663 im assuming that as unemployment rises and inflation pressures subside australian financial conditions will need to be shifted from extremely restrictive to only mildly restrictive
6460664 if that is right the rba probably will be forced to return standard mortgage rates from 9 1 2 per cent today to 8 per cent
6460665 over the past two to three weeks there has been a substantial fall in the price of money in the australian marketplace
6460666 thats come about through the reserve indicating there is going to be an interest rate cut over the next few weeks
6460667 what were forecasting through to next year is that those sources of funds will continue to rise and continue to put upward pressure on the banks cost of funds
6460668 it was substantially above the reserves cash rate and its the banks cost of funds that determines the mortgage rate
6460669 mortgage rates are 9 per cent or more at present essentially because the rba is happy for them to be there

6460679 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6460680 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
6460681 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
6460682 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
6460683 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
6460684 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
6460685 oh weve got more important things we have to do
6460686 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him
6460687 the most inexperienced ticket in the history of the world
6460688 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6460689 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6460690 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6460691 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6460692 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6460693 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6460694 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off

6460702 it was so relevant to what we are doing here

6460707 i think it helps but it doesnt guarantee hes going to win the state
6460708 it may be more useful that evan bayh is on the ticket in other parts of the country he may be more useful in an area like florida
6460709 youre picking somebody from next door youre picking somebody from the midwest who presumably has different values than you
6460710 if evan bayh does become vice president of the united states it leaves an opening at junior senator from indiana its an opening that according to state law the governor gets the opportunity to fill
6460711 to argue that putting bayh on the ticket automatically gives obama indiana is incorrect
6460712 i think it makes it more competitive i still think mccain would have a good chance of winning
6460713 the resume is a key component of any business school application yet many applicants fail to tailor this document to the admissions process our guide has been forged from clear admit

6460716 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6460717 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6460718 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6460719 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6460720 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6460721 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6460722 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6460723 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program

6460733 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better

6460735 were doing jokes about people in his orbit not really about him
6460736 people have a tendency to react as far as their ideology allows them
6460737 i think some of us were maybe too quick to caricature al gore and john kerry and theres maybe some reluctance to do the same thing to him
6460738 anything that has even a whiff of being racist no one is going to laugh
6460739 the audience is not going to allow anyone to do that
6460740 most readers will see it as tasteless and offensive and we agree
6460741 totally inappropriate and frankly i understand if sen obama and his supporters would find it offensive
6460742 we put people in a crazy box they might be truly offended by it but the reaction is part of the standard digestive process bill maher who is host of a politically oriented late night show on hbo said if you cant do irony on the cover of the new yorker where can you do it one issue that clearly has some impact on writing jokes about obama is a consistency among the big late night shows not only are all the hosts white the vast majority of their audiences are white i think white audiences get a little self conscious if race comes up sweeney of obriens show said things might be somewhat different if even one late night host was black black comics are not having any trouble joking about obama said david alan grier a comedian who starting in october will have a satirical news magazine show on comedy central chocolate news i tell jokes on stage about him grier said reciting a few that would not ever get onto a network late night show nor into the new york times but he said of the late night hosts those guys really cant go there its just like the gay comic can do gay material it comes with the territory
6460743 no way theyve had 200 years of presidential jokes its our time jimmy kimmel the host of the abc late night talk show jimmy kimmel live
6460744 theres a weird reverse racism going on you cant joke about him because hes half white its silly i think its more a problem because hes so polished he doesnt seem to have any flaws maher said that being sensitive to obama was in no way interfering with his commentary though on hbo he has more freedom about content than other comedians theres been this question about whether hes black enough
6460745 i have this joke what does he have to do dunk he bowled a 37 to me thats black enough kimmel said i think his ears should be the focus of the jokes mostly the late night shows seem to be in a similar position were just waiting

6460801 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6460802 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6460803 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6460804 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6460805 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6460806 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6460807 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6460808 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6460809 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6460810 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6460811 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6460812 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6460813 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6460814 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6460815 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6460816 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6460817 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6460818 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6460819 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6460820 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6460821 this time the playing field is even and we want it even more

6460827 a gmail user might login to gmail using the ostensibly secure url https mail google com if subsequently surfing cnn com for example via an open wireless connection an attacker could inject a gmail image url and prompt the users browser to transmit an unprotected gmail gx cookie in conjunction with the image fetch operation the attacker could then sniff the unprotected cookie and later use that file to access the victims gmail account

6460829 it has become clear that abkhazia will not live in the same state with georgia
6460830 those who armed georgia are also responsible for what happened in south ossetia and do not have the moral right to claim the role of peacekeepers
6460831 we appeal to russia to be the first country from the international community to recognize the independence of the republic of south ossetia
6460832 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6460833 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6460834 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

6460836 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that

6460838 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6460839 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6460840 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6460841 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6460842 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6460843 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6460844 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6460845 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6460846 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6460847 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6460848 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6460849 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510

6460851 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6460852 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6460853 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6460854 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6460855 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6460856 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6460857 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6460858 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6460859 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6460860 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6460861 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6460862 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

6461259 consular services have so far not been able to confirm the arrest of these two south africans
6461260 however our embassy in uganda is in a process of verifying the arrests with the ugandan authorities upon such verification we will seek permission to visit them in prison to provide them with consular assistance
6461261 a government source confirmed this saying that they were stopped by the joint anti terrorism task force of uganda
6461262 ugandan defence and army spokesperson major paddy ankunda says the two are being held by the chieftaincy of military intelligence in uganda
6461263 he says they are suspected of being allegedly involved in so called terrorism activities and that is whats being investigated
6461264 a study we conducted in 2006 estimated that should we experience total fuel supply disruptions our economy would lose r1 billion a day in 2005 prices
6461265 it will be a dereliction of our constitutional duty and an abomination not to take measures to prevent that possibility
6461266 we are therefore presenting this bill to ensure that we have the means to do proper planning not only for the supply of energy but also for the demand of that energy
6461267 we need adequately to prepare for the periods when unexpected emergencies happen
6461268 in fact we need to give practical expression to the dictum in victory plan for defeat
6461269 this bill ensures that we secure the supply of both energy carriers and feedstock
6461270 it contains sufficient instruments to prevent the possibility of what happened in january this year when all of a sudden we run out of coal for local electricity generation while we were busy in a business as usual way exporting coal
6461271 this bill enjoins us to make a concerted effort to ensure continued and uninterruptible supply of energy
6461272 we will do this firstly by putting in place measures for the holding of strategic or contingency energy feed stocks and energy carriers at a national level and secondly by putting in place measures to ensure adequate investment in energy infrastructure as well as the maintenance thereof
6461273 we are responding through this bill to the outcry of all key industry stakeholders on the availability and in some instances the paucity of data and information used by state owned entities like eskom in deciding whether special rates should be effected on certain customers
6461274 by arriving three minutes late we were not able to check in it was luck
6461275 it was hard to believe because at the airport you did not notice anything
6461276 i clicked on that flight on the internet and for 10 euros i did not select it i was going to take that flight
6461277 i made a great start in race one and got by a couple of cars straight away
6461278 then i got hit at the hairpin when i was almost completely round the corner there was nothing i could do obviously it was good to get up to twelfth after that but i should have been well inside the top ten
6461279 i made another good start but then had a slight off and lost what i had gained i had changed my set up slightly from the first race and it just wasnt right i had a real struggle with the car under braking and i had to fight it through every corner
6461280 race three was another incredibly difficult race for me but in the end it was great to grab a couple of points and to see rob get a podium for the team
6461281 either due to customer dissatisfaction with the product or because users were convinced of its benefits from all of the media hype surrounding its release
6461282 so how does photosynth work photosynth analyzes your photos for similarities to your other photos in the set and then uses the information to estimate where the photos were taken from photosynth then re creates the place the photos were taken and uses that as a canvas to display your photos the work done in analyzing your photos is done via the above mentioned photosynth plug in

6461291 quatro anos atr s o serra e o kassab assumiram a cidade
6461292 a o serra foi eleito governador e kassab continuou trabalhando pela cidade
6461293 nesses dois anos aprendi que um prefeito de verdade tem de ter coragem
6461294 tem de enfrentar e p r a cara para bater n s enfrentamos e a cidade venceu
6461295 its seven seven houses and heres one house america cant afford to let john mccain move into
6461296 tenho certeza que a volta de marta para a prefeitura melhor para s o paulo foi excelente prefeita excelente ministra temos afinidade e juntos pormos fazer muita coisa
6461297 quando serra saiu para o governo kassab assumiu a cidade

6461299 s o paulo n o precisa de mais um gerente para o mesmo projeto precisa de um novo projeto
6461300 com essa hist ria de 56 anos que queremos luta de governan a comunista
6461301 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6461302 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6461303 the negotiators have taken this very very far but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces operate
6461304 obviously the american forces are here coalition forces are here at the invitation of the iraqi government
6461305 what were trying to do is put together an agreement that protects our people respects iraqs sovereignty
6461306 but the goal is to have iraqi forces responsible for the security of iraq
6461307 that is the goal and that has been the goal from the beginning
6461308 we are making progress together in the defeat of iraqs enemies of all stripes
6461309 were not sitting here talking about an agreement to try to get out of a bad situation
6461310 builds on the success we have had in the last year this agreement is based on success
6461311 really we are very very close to closing this agreement
6461312 and as we said from the beginning there is no hidden agenda here
6461313 but really we are redoubling our efforts to bring this to a successful conclusion
6461314 we as the sadr movement denounce this dubious visit and such timing we reaffirm our stance of rejecting the long term agreement we demand the iraqi government and on the highest levels not to sign this unjust agreement and we demand the withdrawal of the government as soon as possible
6461315 one big rumor gets out there and it kind of spreads quickly which is cool
6461316 im glad people are speculating on what the records gonna be we want to keep some of the mystery behind it until the record hits the stands but the record is not based on the life of rasputin
6461317 security forces arrested him when he tried to enter nouadhibou and turned him over to the police who are bringing him to the capital now
6461318 we cannot keep on taking away children from a mother
6461319 my feeling would be that she gana would be going through very similar emotions to any mother
6461320 studies of the mental processes of other animals indicate that the conceptual level necessary for understanding death has not been achieved
6461321 my suspicion is that doubt about animal emotions is espoused not because it serves science but because it protects the emotional needs of the scientist

6461351 to amend the commodity exchange act to prevent excessive price speculation with respect to energy commodities
6461352 it is now evident that speculators in the energy futures markets play a much larger role than previously thought and it is now even harder to accept the agencys laughable assertion that excessive speculation has not contributed to rising energy prices
6461353 difficult to comprehend how the cftc commodity futures trading commission would allow a trader
6461354 the law formally allowed investors to trade energy commodities on private electronic platforms outside the purview of regulators

6461381 i really need to survey everywhere i can this year
6461382 in calculating the counties with wheat acreage infected in the northern panhandle early diagnosis could save as much as 9 million for producers by eliminating wasted irrigations
6461383 we werent testing for triticum at that time so it is also a factor to be investigated
6461384 we have the potential to save producers billions of dollars in wasted irrigation and fertilizer costs
6461385 the main time people irrigate in this area is in the late spring and summer during grain fill and heading

6461409 these last four years were spent traveling doing shows all over the world writing and working with other artists weve really had time to mature into women and master our craft it shows lyrically and vocally on this a bum
6461410 we arent only singers we write all of our music
6461411 nicole plays guitar and deejays we are very musical and try to show this while on stage our vibe isnt like your typical group because nicole deejays shes able to command the crowd and every once and a while well bring the guitar out on stage to show our versatility
6461412 were so excited about the music weve recorded for this album weve grown so much in the last few years and experienced love heartbreak fun times sad times and everything in between the content on th musical is really reflective of our personal experiences

6461414 we grew up in a household where music was always played our dad deejayed from sunrise to sunset its because of him that we learned to appreciate all genres of music and have always been open to experimenting with different sounds and vibes

6461416 at our first session he played us the coolie dance riddim and within 30 minutes of hearing it and vibing out wed written
6461417 we had no idea what would come of it but he kept saying the song was gonna be big same way he believed in us we believed in him and the song took off
6461418 when we were signed to universal records we always felt disconnected they didnt understand us as a group and didnt give us the proper attention a label should give any artist they are trying to propel to success
6461419 after our last situation ended we knew it was important to sign with someone who believed in us our movement and our music from the beginning bryan leach got it it was as if he was a part of our team even prior to signing to s label

6461467 most employers understand that not every minute of the day is dedicated to work in fact in todays 24 7 global economy it is likely that work bleeds into our personal lives

6461484 poor standard can not be just attributed finance we need to see a new approach to hygiene coming from the minister of health down and from the workforce upwards
6461485 we need to see real action from the minister michael mcgimpsey to tackle what is clearly more than just a hygiene or attitude issue given number of deaths associated with hospital infections the response from the minster and the rqia needs to be decisive

6461510 over the years nearly 100k has been spent on the milk cup and clubs have benefited from the largess of council yet none of this has been in the dungiven area or to the benefit of the majority sport in this borough unlike the actions of nearly every other council in the north
6461511 instead of fostering and encouraging these voluntary and community organisations some councillors and council officers seem to suggest that this would put an unbearable strain on resources yet on tuesday night we faced a veritable phalanx of the same officers at what cost to the ratepayer
6461512 i was also disappointed by the attitude of the chair of the sports council who yet again voted against supporting sporting provision outside of limavady or in the promotion of our national games and would contend that his position has become untenable

6461580 details how local educators are earnestly responding to the unrelenting pressure of top down accountability policies often with little support from above
6461581 even when principals place heavy emphasis on activities such as identifying struggling students or emphasizing test preparation teachers often adopt inconsistent practices displaying considerable autonomy
6461582 when district leaders emphasized that boosting learning is the paramount priority and principals motivated their teachers we found smaller achievement gaps between ethnic groups

6461637 some friends and i rented a cabin up near sparta center throckmorton lived right next door it was one of the greatest experiences of my life
6461638 the girlfriend i had in my senior year went to graduate school to study english we broke up pretty soon after that but i was really in love with her and i wanted to woo her back i thought that if she was a big english department type id try the throckmorton routine on her wholeness forgiveness reconciliation that sort of stuff what i didnt understand was that she was now working in the factory where she saw all that stuff being made it had no more effect on her than it would have on a hooker
6461639 foreign minister salah bashir summoned the israeli ambassador this week to officially inform him that jordan rejects such illegal measures
6461640 this would also lead to a new violent conflict in the middle east because jerusalem is a red line for muslims and arabs
6461641 he caught me he kicked me straight in the head with carlos you expect that you know what hes dirty i wish i could say otherwise ive seen it in mls there is no place for it its reckless its there for everyone to see i kind of expect it thats what he does i think you would rather have him be a man out there and say look i dont like you i am going to kick you you can almost respect it in a funny way he has this way about him he kicks he punches hes an amp and he wants to come and be your friend when he tried to apologize there is no place for it
6461642 a celebrity that was too hip ouch sorry jerry or a possible flash in the pan
6461643 and what is it with windows vista i spend so much time restarting my pc ive a callous on my index finger they should call it windows blister try the pate
6461644 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6461645 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6461646 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6461647 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6461648 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6461649 its incredible amazing a helluva lot better than the new primal scream
6461650 thousands of people have simply disappeared nobody knows where they are or indeed if they are still alive shinawatra is a gangster
6461651 lets have total transparency mr scudamore we have nothing to hide why was a full transparent and thorough investigation not done when your member clubs have a right to know whats happened why are they the premier league clouding this issue why were the full facts not heard why were people not questioned they never once asked us about any paperwork never held discussions with us never wrote us a letter how did they decide on a 5 5million fine with only 50 of the facts
6461652 quando ho saputo che hamas organizzava un matrimonio collettivo a jabalya mi sono rincuorato
6461653 anche perch cos sarebbe stato possibile celebrare adeguatamente il nostro matrimonio pur con il dolore che provo per la uccisione di mio fratello
6461654 li ho passati agli amici che mi avevano anticipato soldi per il matrimonio
6461655 siamo grati a hamas dicono per aver organizzato il matrimonio collettivo magari se ne facciano altri in futuro
6461656 you know i could have gone home and sat in my recliner and watched it on the tv like everybody else or i could come here and take part
6461657 so to me the decision when you put it in those terms is pretty easy
6461658 well i think youll find that if you do your research hundreds of athletes have done this i guess i am the first one to just draw attention to it
6461659 america has done it america has won many medals with athletes that are foreign born
6461660 its a dream that a little boy from kenya has dreamt about and finally came true and it didnt happen by myself
6461661 from the coach who sent me to the united states from the coach that i got from washington state and from the scholarship itself that came from the american taxpayers american money i am trying to give back to america what they gave me long before
6461662 if that trend develops yes i am sure the ioc would look at it
6461663 i think the rules are about right i think on balance we would want people to take part in the games rather than deny them the opportunity
6461664 if floodgates begin to open then clearly it offends the overall principles and that i am certain we would look at but i dont think its quite at that stage yet
6461665 when the american national anthem is played i feel enormous pride
6461666 my loyalty is for the country that i am representing right now and that is the united states
6461667 i dont know about other people who might have a lot of mixed feelings back in my country seeing the american flag being raised instead of the kenyan flag
6461668 my sister called me and told me he won but she didnt think the person who told her knew what they were talking about this is so good we knew he could do it but we didnt want to brag
6461669 the stick was in my hand i think i felt it hit my hand but i dont think it was in all the way before i grabbed its probably my fault i take the blame for it
6461670 things did not go as planned the stick had a mind of its own
6461671 we were looking forward to running against the americans in the final because they are one of the best teams out there but our team is very strong it would have been hard to beat us
6461672 i would be extremely delighted if shevchenko returns to milan and i am ready to embrace the ukraine champion again for us its about a return home
6461673 rosario central enfrentar ma ana a un equipo de col n que no presiona tanto como river pero que jam s retrocede porque su propuesta pasa por buscar los partidos y no defenderse nunca
6461674 i think its more than 7 but i guess it depends on how you count i suppose itll be okay if factcheck or similar calls obamas ad false like this the obama campaign falsely claimed that john mccain owns 7 homes in fact he owns 12
6461675 certainly any time a state decides to take mid year fiscal adjustments its a good thing new york over the last few years has proven itself to be very focused on its financial balance and financial condition this suggests that that trend is still in place
6461676 weve established a cushion that will hopefully tide us over to next years budget and we have cut into next years budget
6461677 theres a lot more to do but the winds of change have come to albany
6461678 its was pretty clear that the original budget they enacted was overly optimistic and there was going to be work that had to be done something along these lines was going to be necessary
6461679 the revenue numbers that weve seen since the budget was enacted have come down so much that probably the step that theyve taken while definitely positive will probably be only the first in a series that will be needed in order to close out year gaps
6461680 we certainly agree there is downside risk to wall street revenues so we view this positively
6461681 it seems pretty responsive to what the facts on the ground are and whats going on with wall street
6461682 one of the reasons we have a positive outlook on new york state is because of their recent budgeting behavior and this is consistent with that
6461683 creating hyperlinks between images and its doing that based on the content inside of the images
6461684 when you do a web search for images you type in phrases and the text on the web page is carrying lots of information about that photograph what if that picture links to your pictures
6461685 this is something that grows in complexity as people use it
6461686 because photosynth is so new you will probably run into an occasional bug or hiccup
6461687 whether you have a brilliant idea or find a bug please let us know well do our best to address them
6461688 miles de mexicanos no conocen la diferencia entre afuera y adentro t puedes hacer que esto cambie
6461689 when the country started there were basically three crimes piracy counterfeiting and treason
6461690 at the time of our 1998 report there were some 4 000 crimes
6461691 its clear to me that if the plaintiff jacob was denied this relief he would suffer irreparable harm
6461692 his condition has already deteriorated significantly in the past year
6461693 they had a special relationship that this court considers more than typical
6461694 in fact on the very night mrs gunvalson and her son were staying at the home of a ptc employee another patients parent was staying with her as well
6461695 in contrast to big pharmaceutical concerns it is quite natural for our team to form close relationships with patients and other members of the rare disease community
6461696 our relationship with the parents of patients should be taken as evidence of our commitment to the community rather than as evidence of some promise of special treatment
6461697 if we do there is serious risk no patients will want to participate in our current clinical trials in which they might receive a placebo rather than ptc124
6461698 its clear that hes getting weaker as it goes on
6461699 thats why you see the voiolent chasing to cover their shorts
6461700 the only rational action to be taken relative to fannie and freddie is to get rid of them bove wrote in a research note

6461703 the success of the beijing olympic games has showcased chinas strong capabilities boosted mutual understanding between the chinese and foreign citizens and will surely stimulate its further opening up
6461704 the beijing games are such a wonderful event and have been well organized everyone involved has done a good job the opening ceremony was the largest and most brilliant in olympic history
6461705 the power of the chinese people is so huge they are full of strength a country like this is very promising

6461725 these new figures are tragic and frightening and represent a wake up call for the nation
6461726 they show that previous estimates of the epidemics size and cost were very much understated
6461727 we know that obesity and type two diabetes can be prevented and we need to make fundamental changes in the way we live to arrest the escalating crisis

6461747 we spend half of our lives in front of the computer where what we see consists of small squares in one colour what i often like to do with my design is to divide it up into the smallest parts of our daily life pixels atoms metaphorically speaking jigsaws boxes blocks bricks and from that i create a world of its own a kind of sci fi landscape

6461759 we are strongly encouraging corporations that value their products and reputations to join forces with us in order to put those who steal your product out of business in jail or both hiring a former agent from the fbi or waiting for global law enforcement to help is a pipe dream with a serious global recession looming corporations cannot just sit by while someone else makes amp resells their product the epicenter of all of this is china and india
6461760 we had no idea how vast the problem is nor did we understand that virtually every legitimate corporate manufactured product is being counterfeited in china or india with the increasing probability of a severe global recession americas watchdog is urging corporations to utilize the very unique services offered by the global piracy amp counterfeiting consultants
6461761 the top ten global pharma companies are each losing billions of u s dollars a year to pharmaceutical counterfeiting the big tobacco companies are each losing billions of dollars per year to counterfeit cigarettes 200 billion of which are made in china auto parts manufacturers are losing billions a year sporting goods or entertainment companies are losing billions of dollars a year etc it has to stop and we have an integrated approach that will identify the counterfeit product retailers wholesalers and manufacturers there is nothing even close to our capabilities in the world
6461762 big pharmaceutical companies have done a pathetic job of protecting their brands and consumers are probably dying because of it
6461763 do not purchase any product on the internet unless you are 100 satisfied you are purchasing the authentic product amp it is produced by the legitimate manufacturer
6461764 we consider everyone warned and no corporate official can say they did an adequate job combating global piracy with the exception of microsoft

6461839 we know what we need on a global level in terms of reductions
6461840 we cannot continue forever saying this is an issue for the industrial countries and no one else should do anything
6461841 unless we come with a spirit of co operation trying to resolve things instead of making things more and more complicated
6461842 a lot of governments dont have positions yet and are going through internal processes where ideas are still festering
6461843 it was nice hanging out for a couple of hours
6461844 we just have to establish one thing before we get started i want to share with our listeners that luke made a comment on his blog a couple of years ago that soul prints was worthless but your girlfriend liked it
6461845 my girlfriend said it was the best book on judaism shed ever read
6461846 now we have the real source of luke ford going after marc gafni his girlfriend liked soul prints she thought it was the best book on judaism she ever read and he didnt
6461847 the reason im having this conversation with you we decided wed interview each other is to really do what nobody ever does talk to the other side who you feel is totally discredited totally unethical the worst version of tabloid internet everything i dont believe in
6461848 there was no one who said thats a good idea sorry
6461849 im really trying to go with my heart here and my heart was two things a because youre the person online whos created a lot of the negative record lets talk it through b everyone says youll distort everything i say c i have this belief that everybody no matter how complex they are has a point of integrity we can talk to and i believe thats true about me and i believe thats true about you im talking now to luke ford the angel im talking to the luke ford of radical integrity im talking to the luke ford who i can completely trust thats what im doing here
6461850 lets talk a little bit about what we talked about this morning who are you who is luke ford let me try to explain the question and ill give it completely over to you youre a little bit of a paradox and an enigma we just had a nice breakfast in salt lake city and we had a lovely waitress named lindsay wholesome beautiful energy shes sweet and you just fell in love with her
6461851 totally i fell in love with lindsay im a fool for love
6461852 shes this wholesome on the other hand theres lukeford com hardcore pornography right
6461853 thank you for helping me with that question what makes you run on the one hand theres this soft appreciation of a woman whos clearly a woman with integrity wholesome you could feel her values feel her goodness she didnt have her sexuality protruding she had her dignity a feminine beauty in its most wondrous dignified form you had this appreciation for that i saw it on your face i offered to perform the marriage did we agree on that
6461854 oh yeah shaking hands wish we had this on video
6461855 when luke ford gets married rabbi gafni will marry you
6461856 at the same time youre a gossip columnist or were correct me if im wrong for the pornography industry at least in the way youre quoted online you say things like true or not true im going to put anything out there and see what sticks slander is obviously a big jewish deal thirty nine times that doesnt seem to stop you so quickly you said something in the car that was helpful from some tv show that everyone has their own code
6461857 omar in the wire makes his living from holding up drug dealers
6461858 meaning that everybody has a code even hitler had a code
6461859 the downfall was a great movie on hitler that came out in 2004 he was a protagonist it was his last week of life in the bunker and he was a sympathetic protagonist
6461860 my point is that everybody has a code everybody thinks certain things are right and certain things are wrong hitler thought that killing jews was right
6461861 you take judaism seriously youre sitting here in a yarmulke and tzitzit you made a blessing over your food with your permission i can describe you
6461862 youre wearing a beard i was surprised you told me you read an article by meir soloveitchik in commentary about the jewish significance of the beard
6461863 those are pretty strong positions there and yet you may be mis cited correct me i dont want to say anything thats not right but youre cited playing fast and loose with the truth about a lot of people online people say about you online that the man just thrives for negative attention so how do those two fit together whats the code whats the internal system
6461864 first when someone converts to anything including judaism they bring everything that they are all their baggage to the mix
6461865 so i believe that judaism is gods will for the jewish people but my judaism is still poured through my very flawed vessel i am narcissistic i do have narcissistic personality disorder i had that before i became interested in judaism and i have that now when i am interested in judaism my judaism gets poured through my flawed vessel
6461866 one of my rules for this interview is that im going to slander no one im going to attack no one im going to try to go deep with you about ideas and what lifes about we can talk about me we can talk about you you can ask questions
6461867 you just talked about a gorgeous idea you said everyone has flaws you seem to have a very high level of contradiction but whatever
6461868 youre saying that the will of god or the light if you will is refracted through the prism of the vessel
6461869 who you are is the prism through which the light is refracted
6461870 it means that we need to do two different types of work in the world because were all imperfect vessels for the light
6461871 the analogy to the movie i dont mean to compare you to hitler theres no analogy between you and hitler no its not cool but in other words the idea is that a guy likes puppies on the one hand and on the other hand hes gassing jews youre talking about that level of deep and profound contradiction
6461872 at least not on thursdays thursday is a total gas free day
6461873 i just want to tell you luke that all this talk about me sexually harassing im really just into barnyard animals im also responsible for global warming its me and ive got something to do with famine in africa
6461874 but can you not disperse this tape too big its just kinda between us
6461875 secret safe with luke ford people listening how safe would that make you feel
6461876 when we were buying you your first digital tape recorder
6461877 luke has pointed out that 99 of the world is ahead of me in high tech and im a bad driver but youre also a bad driver
6461878 so were talking to morgan and we had this conversation are people basically good or are people basically bad stuff my basic position is that people often act out of narrow self interest but at their deepest place people are ultimately good at their deepest place people are gorgeous are beautiful
6461879 im concerned youll run over your phone with your chair
6461880 thats your goodness coming out that was purely altruistic you had no reason to tell me that that was goodness you were taking care of me in that moment and i appreciate it yo
6461881 my basic feeling is that ultimately people at their core love other people people at their core want to be good people at their core are good people at their core feel better when theyre living meaningful lives people at their core are what we call in judaism homo imitatio dei imitate god well thats latin bzelem elohim in gods image theyre what dante called babyfaced divines people are beautiful theyre loving people are devastated when theyre betrayed because it is a violation of something essential and beautiful in the human being people feel most alive and most aligned with the universe with the divinity when theyre actually expressing their basic good nature thats the gafni position
6461882 the first two statements you made that people are basically good and that when they are at their deepest place that theyre good and loving theyre not falsifiable assertions
6461883 this is another example of natural goodness someone just brought us a beautiful drink did you do this for an ulterior motive or just to be good
6461884 so give me your position now were finally understanding why you didnt like soul prints but why didnt you like the girlfriend
6461885 can we just drink to whatever is good in her
6461886 every army in the world when it can rapes on mass except israel and maybe america id argue to you that all men unless theyre extremely good or timid are rapists and they only reason they dont is not because in a deep place theyre good but because theyre afraid of being caught
6461887 let me try to unpack that and try to get to a deeper place here
6461888 when i say that all people in their deepest place are good im not saying that all people are naturally good
6461889 however theres a second level when theyre basically acting out of narrow self interest but society constrains them
6461890 then theres a third level when theyve done work theyve done spiritual practice theyre trained and refined their deepest self for what rav kook calls their essential self that third level is what im talking about
6461891 im not sure we disagree at the surface level i agree with you one hundred million people killed im not suggesting a naive position if you can speak to a persons deepest self we now have records of how the nazi guards felt in the camps they were devastated
6461892 dennis prager likes to cite the movie from woody allen crimes and misdemeanors
6461893 the good brother the rabbi goes blind and the bad brother whos having an affair gets away with murder
6461894 yes a persons weakness will create a default position which you described the default evil human being level one
6461895 level two the person constrained by the laws of society but level three ohmigod people are beautiful luke
6461896 theres a great statement by rabbi kook when he says that the essence of who i am is revealed at my moment of greatness
6461897 heres how i would say it to you you luke look for a person at their moment of flaw you look for a person when theyve messed up and you want to freeze frame on the flaw and youre always going to find that because everyones flawed
6461898 what were you gaining from that nothing nothing you were just in godspace if you were to ask me who luke ford really is its luke ford at that moment all that other stuff you do work it out work it out
6461899 respond tell me where im off have i created some resolution here
6461900 next question here i gave you this morning my psychologization of luke ford do i have your permission to repeat it one of our rules is no surprises
6461901 to reduce a person to somebody elses analysis is not fair
6461902 when i say with your permission its a real question anything you tell me you dont want to talk about ill stay away from
6461903 so what i said to luke this morning as we were having breakfast at this great restaurant the oasis restaurant where i left my credit card in salt lake city
6461904 my sense was that luke that somebody in your life disappointed you big time and that this person was an authority figure it was a mum it was a dad it was an uncle or a minister i dont know your life big time that this person was somehow an elmer gantry figure and you realized that the person was not only flawed but profoundly hypocritical profoundly fake and you can almost feel your rage at this person and you have this life mission to show that all these people who seem so elegant and beautiful that underneath they have clay feet part of your moral code if you will you have a moral mission to expose those clay feet is that accurate
6461905 yeah i think theres a lot of accuracy to that
6461906 in other words to a certain sense youve established an empirical data
6461907 your favorite book im thinking of inscribing it to you and giving you a copy
6461908 i write in the beginning of soul prints in my own self description i write i dont know if youve ever read this or not read it but i write in it some place that in his own self description gafni calls himself a flawed human being whos forever striving
6461909 i cant resist a parenthesis here with your permission i dont know if its you or someone else someone keeps writing online it comes up when my name comes that hes changed his name from winiarz to gafni and hes hiding
6461910 of course its the most ridiculous thing in the world
6461911 i think that for a little time in my twenties my secretary spelled my name winyiarz
6461912 were getting a little smile here from luke too bad its not on video
6461913 so back to our thing here ok let me throw it over to you thats what were talking about here
6461914 right i dont have any response i wasnt sure if there was a question
6461915 i didnt sleep well last night are you tired you got up really early
6461916 its a symptom of the craft one thousand airplanes landing safely in salt lake city today is not news one plane that crashes in bangladesh killing 85 people is news if i had a choice between writing about 10 000 airplanes that landed safely and the one airplane that crashed id prefer to write about the one airplane that crashed
6461917 to translate that if i had a choice between writing about the 98 that may be good in a person or the 2 thats flawed the news is the bit that is flawed the 98 that they did well thats not news
6461918 its on youtube and all of a sudden the entire campaign is about this one mistake bill clinton made
6461919 heres a question for you could i take one luke ford sexual mistake which you can tell me about today but no were not asking personal questions sorry sorry sorry right and blow it out and say that is who luke ford is of course i could
6461920 i have found as a journalist that politicians are about the most vapid group of people i have not been following bill clinton on the campaign trail ive seen the same news but ive not been following it carefully i have not been thinking about it but it is entirely possible to me that that angry three minute rant may be the most significant three minutes of his time on the campaign trail everything bill clinton has said that ive seen has been vapid
6461921 i accept the emendation i dont know politicians i dont even have an opinion
6461922 luke you made this emendation about politicians which i said i have no knowledge about
6461923 let me move away from the particular political issue and talk about the person
6461924 you said a thousand planes landing safely is not news the plane that crashes is news
6461925 the thousand planes that land safely depend on thousands of people to do their job with integrity
6461926 youre not acting in describing reality youre letting yourself be driven by the lowest common denominator in humanity remember the coliseum in rome where people are fed to the lions
6461927 does that give you an image maybe the blogosphere is where people are fed to the lions we try to find whats flawed in a person sure not true doesnt really matter as long as we can hook it on something then we kinda create a tabloid roman coliseum run by the lowest human instincts
6461928 why would you luke ford an intelligent refined man who can fall in love with the waitress let yourself be determined and controlled by this lowest human instinct
6461929 when you condemn news driven by ratings lets unpack that to use a gafniism
6461930 another word for ratings is reality when we say high ratings we mean news that people want to read or watch on tv even more than that its news that advertisers will pay to advertise on because there will be enough readers or viewers to reward them
6461931 in other words we are talking about news that sustains itself were talking about news that people are willing to pay for with either their time or attention
6461932 saying that a newscast or newspaper or blog has high ratings thats the same as saying that that business is profitable
6461933 now a lot of people want to buy pornography and drugs and buy bad things but a lot of people also want to buy good things so the fact that a lot of people want something is not necessarily indicative that were dealing with the lowest common denominator
6461934 we have so little spare time i see nothing wrong with someone wanting to spend 30 seconds on the plane that crashed rather than 30 seconds on the people who insure that planes dont crash
6461935 here he is doing all these deep complex issues and here he had five people in lingerie and that got the highest ratings and he was so disgusted by it he quit national tv
6461936 it is easier to look at five beautiful women in lingerie than to talk about the 50 million people who dont have health insurance
6461937 but what id rather do and i think you would also thats what im challenging you on and you can push back as im sure you will youre not known to be shy but i say that talking about the 50 million people who are suffering because they dont have health insurance and trying to come up with a solution so there will be more compassion and more goodness in the world is on a deeper level more satisfying than looking at the five women in lingerie
6461938 now they are different satisfactions they both have validity aesthetic beauty is beautiful but ultimately i apologize to referring to that book soul prints again
6461939 theres an idea that we talked about there called aftertaste
6461940 so the question is five women in lingerie on pragers tv show whatever nice moment
6461941 i guess im asking you a rabbi question but not asking you as a rabbi ive given up on a being a formal artist im more of a spiritual artist and a friend for these three hours wouldnt you rather spend your life doing something that will give you a great aftertaste isnt that a fair question
6461942 there are things that are more important to me than aftertaste
6461943 ill give you an empirical example i was immersed in the bowels of the pornography industry for about 12 years the pornography industry is what people who know nothing about the pornography industry think it is it is a low scummy place
6461944 i broke a story about a guy who had hiv and who was transmitting hiv to a lot of other people
6461945 this was a very dirty story this was about deviant forms of sex and deception and prostitution everything about this story was yucky i cant reveal tell the story in polite company because the details are revolting
6461946 by publishing that story i saved a lot of peoples lives this guy was outed as hiv positive he was stopped from performing there were girls who were saved from performing with him because of what i wrote
6461947 once you have the rush of saving lives worries about aftertaste are secondary
6461948 it was a filthy world and it was a filthy story but it was an important story the importance of a story is more important to me than how i feel about myself during and after
6461949 that validates what im trying to say that luke ford in all his complex contradictions is turned on by doing good just like getting the story right creates good in the world when youre just throwing spaghetti at the wall and getting things wrong creates bad in the world
6461950 a professor of a recent book on happiness said you can either be in the problem solving mindset or you can be in the victim mindset but you cant be in both simultaneously being in one state precludes the other if you feel like you are in charge of your life and you are taking steps to improve your life you can not simultaneous feel sorry for yourself and if you feel sorry for yourself you cant take steps to improve your life
6461951 a person can either be a victim or a player
6461952 a person whos a victim says they did it to me im powerless
6461953 if a person in a company says they did it they cover themselves but theyre not that helpful to the company whenever something happens its someone elses fault because they are not part of the solution they are part of the problem
6461954 what i do with spiritually incorrect is i try and tell the story of what happened without mentioning any person directly or indirectly without slandering anyone what are the big ideas what was the email you sent me last night
6461955 i dont tell it from the perspectives of people i use the prism of ideas
6461956 one way of telling the story is they did it to me
6461957 the question is what is my 5 or 10 or 20 what is my percent in any story that happens to me ive got to identify what my part in that story is and what did i do to create the conditions for what happened to me thats where my power is
6461958 the price of innocence is impotence im only innocent when im impotent i may be innocent of complaints people made about me but if i just focus on that i dont get anywhere ive got to see what i can learn from this whats my part
6461959 i want to introduce a new phrase a contribution system not a blame frame but a contribution system we have to move in life from a blame frame to a contribution system whats my part in a contribution system that created events
6461960 thats very different from new age thinking that says you create your whole reality
6461961 a lot of horrible things happen in the world which we dont create i dont blame the rwandan mother who sees her family massacred in front of her
6461962 theres one position that says we create our own reality thats position a
6461963 position b says we create none of our own reality were victims
6461964 the more intelligent and more true the deeper position says no i dont create my own reality and im not a victim
6461965 thats a position that seems to me to be very powerful
6461966 that creates a pretty powerful frame both men and women need to own their power
6461967 men need to own their power in the sense that she said no but i got carried way because if she said no and you got carried away thats rape
6461968 because a man is often more physically powerful than a woman we have a whole set of laws against rape no is actually no
6461969 theres a whole complex other question which ive never been involved with in my life per se what if a woman is saying no but acting yes
6461970 thats a complex question lets put that aside lets talk about a straight no
6461971 thats a straight no so when a man overpowers that no thats a violation of male power thats a violation of the vulnerable of the helpless and deserves societal restraint and censure
6461972 women also have power they have all sorts of power they have intellectual power they have feminine radiant power they have sexual power they have verbal power
6461973 the image of the powerless woman and the powerful man that is something that i hope feminism did away with what feminism tried to say was that women are autonomous and powerful
6461974 as opposed to power feminism victim feminism says women are basically victims he did it to me
6461975 were not talking about rape the he did it to me with rape is a real thing
6461976 were talking about theres a relationship the relationship is fully mutual fully consensual
6461977 they have a relationship that is completely mutual where both man and women engage initiate etc and that doesnt work and then she goes back and rereads the story re members reworks the story and it becomes a harassment story thats a violation of female power
6461978 men are powerful and women are powerful men are vulnerable and women are vulnerable men lie and women lie theres masculine shadow and feminine shadow
6461979 i wanted to move out of theoretical victim structure you set up and i expanded on to bring it into the realm of relationships between masculine and feminine
6461980 the following analogy is not fully true but it is true enough to be interesting and relevant to what you said
6461981 with every lover a man grows bigger and stronger and with every lover a woman is like a rose that loses a petal
6461982 i want to fully inhabit the idea without blabbing about it
6461983 that means that theres a part of masculinity in this aphorism which is expansive and polyamorous and is not monogamous by nature theres a male expansion that happens from being with many women
6461984 at the same time theres the greek goddess hera its about hearth theres a feminist hearth quality that her full blossom is achieved with her relationship with the one man and with every lover she loses a petal
6461985 you understand the feminists would kill you on this so you better hope that they are not listening and that they dont have your address
6461986 the idea that youre putting out is that theres a difference between feminine and masculine nature
6461987 and thats it is not ok to have mutual affairs with women
6461988 well youre talking about mutuality rather than consenting and if theres mutuality in a relationship it is between equals im saying that unless a relationship lasts a lifetime theres a power exchange to the mans benefit and to the womans detriment
6461989 even though in secular western ethics mutuality means something perfectly legal and ethical nonetheless theres something essential about the difference between the masculine and the feminine and that the mans masculine nature by itself is a violation of the feminine
6461990 my friend dalit completely believes in that position she views as her life goal an entire set of womens blogs to teach that position
6461991 shes the person i was announced to be marrying not true your friend seems to announce marriages that have no relationship to reality but what can you do
6461992 a good feminist can disagree with that position thats a chauvinistic patriarchal outmoded view of feminine sexuality which devalues feminine autonomy and all the gains of feminism i dont think that bothers you per se
6461993 i think you meant that position in a personal way so let me respond in a personal way
6461994 one of my greatest life desires in the same way i tried to talk about where your rage comes from is for a monogamous great love
6461995 when i was 31 much like the same experience you had with our waitress only deeper this is an example of one of the stories out there
6461996 i was willing to give up my rabbinic reputation at that time everything almost for that great love i dont think we even kissed we just hugged
6461997 her father plugged into pag parents against gafni he was the head of the local pag chapter he did everything he could successfully to break up that relationship
6461998 i remember that i thought that that relationship was more important than everything else in the world
6461999 it didnt work too well for me i gave up everything for it and then she didnt appear i was completely devastated
6462000 i only once in my life worked out intensely i had four months when i went they were after this thing fell apart
6462001 i was living in kiryat ona near bar ilan university
6462002 i would go five times a week i was the littlest guy in the gym i was pumping up and down it was the only way i could survive
6462003 about six or seven weeks later she got engaged to someone else the last thing she said to me was i will always love you
6462004 i remember the day she got married i was just streaming tears little gafni trying to pump iron in the gym
6462005 the great love has always been important to me and its always been numinous ive not succeeded in accomplishing that
6462006 that great desire remember herman hesses book narcissus and goldmund it was more about sexuality but that kind of split in me that deep desire to have this great love and that somehow this was the most holy thing in the world and this drove a lot of my life
6462007 we can psychologize it i dont like to reduce things to psychology not you or me
6462008 theres a second belief ive had parallel to this my whole life osha talks about this hes a complex eastern philosopher
6462009 you asked about my book mystery of love mystery of love is about this youll like my book mystery of love less than soul prints i promise
6462010 it talks about what does it mean to be a great lover
6462011 i take responsibility for anyone who was emotionally hurt in that process
6462012 bono thinks we hurt each other and do it again
6462013 i want to offer you something that takes us to a different place
6462014 my first girlfriend told me you play with a girls feelings and then say you need to act in your own self interest
6462015 she was saying once youre having sex with me you cant expect me to act rationally
6462016 thats beautiful thats not a legal category its not even an ethical category its about spirit
6462017 classical feminist issue will take complete issue with what you said you are moving it back to pre feminism youre saying that once a woman is sexually involved she can no longer be autonomous and powerful
6462018 feminism teaches that women can be autonomous and powerful women can be sexually autonomous and powerful women can make sexual choices women can choose to have sexual relationships for pleasure for friendship and intimacy
6462019 i have two groups of women friends on this issue
6462020 one group of woman friends which ill call the dalit position says you are absolutely right
6462021 theres a huge part of me thats holding that today as the highest possibility
6462022 let me ask you a question so what do we do with that today in a society in which that does not seem like an easy possibility youre not married i assume youve been involved with women
6462023 ive slept with about 40 women in my life some of them were porn stars and they were able to have sex without emotional commitment
6462024 ok ok ok so what do we do today our whole society is built in a way that men and women go out
6462025 its a sex society women are dressed immodestly tv billboards everything is conspiring against that ideal youd have to battle all of society not to mention our own nature
6462026 how do we navigate rabbi luke ford how do we navigate society
6462027 if youre going to fulfill this ideal youre going to have to ghettoize yourself you shouldnt own a tv you shouldnt go to movies maybe you shouldnt even look at the daily newspaper because there are bra ads you shouldnt be alone in a room with a member of the opposite sex you should fulfill orthodox judaism most people will need to become religiously orthodox to fulfill this ideal most people will need that kind of religious rigor to live this
6462028 i think youre right orthodox judaism is powerful in this area it prescribes all physical contact before marriage physical contact as is always a slippery slope being alone with a member of the opposite sex is by itself a sexual event its called yichud and therefore it is proscribed
6462029 it allows for sexuality only within the context of either marriage or a committed exclusive relationship called pelegesh ultimately that would make society a healthier place
6462030 theres a large part of me that agrees with that three years ago there wasnt three years ago i was more trying to see what was possible theres a large orthodox voice inside of me which feels that that is very powerful and true and compelling and that is the great gift of orthodoxy
6462031 i have another voice and i want to own that voice as well
6462032 heres the second voice sexuality is beautiful and gorgeous and that both men and women have the ability to be loving and sexual with each other with clear honest and full intention and that there are different stages of life the stages are the key to this hermeneutic
6462033 playing the field but in a sacred way in a way thats not demeaning disclosing of full intention the woman may be going out with different people thats a certain stage of life at the end of that stage of life i make a decision who im going to settle down with
6462034 i have a teacher who married a woman from paris he says they never talk about before they were married thats a parisian thing its not gentlemanly to ask what were you doing before we were married
6462035 that may be a model that holds the possibility of having different partners and loving people fully and transitioning to a place of radical monogamy at a different stage of life
6462036 i honestly dont know which one is correct i have deep inner conflict about each one i dont feel that i have purified myself sufficiently to be able to look at that in the most honest way
6462037 it seems that every redemptive messianic movement tried to rethink the sexual issue because everyone was stuck on this
6462038 the stuck problem is that monogamy doesnt work so well either
6462039 i found so many times that people married the wrong person for this or that psychological reason
6462040 the monogamy idea for all the idyllic beauty that weve ascribed to it isnt working
6462041 on the other hand theres the sharp critique that youve made correctly of the broad open free more flowing position
6462042 marc i came here to salt lake city with one simple question tell me about your life that gary rosenblatt communicated to you that he wanted to talk about your past sex life
6462043 always a good phone call to get from gary blessings to gary
6462044 i dont follow the blogs but a particular rabbi may he blessed whos been very much my nemesis for almost 30 years someone who i barely know but someone i represent something to is very good friends with gary rosenblatt i think it was on your blog
6462045 whats so funny about the jewish community with blessings to all is that nobody tries to hide it
6462046 there is a group of people who know each other and went to yu together or did not go to yu but are close old friends as this rabbi says he is with gary and as a number of other key rabbis and leaders that gary has left off the hook on sexual issues also are im not part of that group
6462047 if i can share something that luke said when the tape recorder is off which i thought was nice citing a feminist masculinist theorist in this case dennis prager that when you ask a guy a question hell give you all the theory and when you ask a girl shell give you details
6462048 luke and i have agreed that were not going to talk about this or that sexual detail its not about lukes sex life and not about gary rosenblatts sex life were not going to slander anyone but were going to talk about the the story and not just theories
6462049 the first feeling was how much im not in the old boys network im so unprotected i grew up in columbus ohio i send blessings to my parents i left home when i was 13 years old to go to a yeshiva high school it was a complex home
6462050 when gary called me garys an old insider i knew before it was written on your blog that he was close friends with this particular rabbi who doesnt seem particularly bent on my positive unfolding in life my heart dropped
6462051 it was even before that i remember where i was i was teaching at a retreat center and someone handed me a copy of the jewish week garys newspaper and it said there and people urged me to look into a philandering rabbi who changed his name and moved to israel
6462052 it was clear to me that i was in their sights these guys want to take me down
6462053 who people pick in journalism to go after have a lot to do with the old boys network has a lot to do with the old boys network has a lot to do with other things other than the things that should motivate a story
6462054 if gary wants to call and correct me on this im happy to have a private conversation with him and go through whats going on out there and why you pick a particular thing
6462055 i went to talk to someone and they said no what are you talking about but in my body it said this is real its nasty its not going to be pleasant i may go down i said to myself ill get back up with gods help
6462056 i just had this feeling i had a very bad feeling
6462057 i dont do anything about it what is there to do
6462058 thats where the changed name story began as i read to you from soul prints everything ive written in many lectures ive given i always talk about my name evoution similar to barry to barack winiarz and gafni and hebraicizing it
6462059 my second feeling was helplessness as i read to you from soul prints which was already published then both of my names are there its very clear that there was no false name change but that didnt matter to anyone
6462060 did you read kafkas trial the facts dont matter so much you begin to feel helpless that what should be isnt it was devastating i can literally call it up in my body now they talk about your heart falling to your stomach thats what it felt like worse than when those people left you in that bad neighborhood in la
6462061 i was teaching at rabbi michael lerner the editor of tikkun
6462062 the way the story is told 45 year old gafni is sleeping with a 14 year old girl when in fact gafni was just out of high school
6462063 the woman who i wish only good to and i would meet with luke at any time if you wind up being the facilitator of it i will meet with her at any time at any place in a facilitated context to bring healing to this
6462064 she wrote me a letter after the relationship was over describing it as the most beautiful relationship describing me
6462065 i read once your story this womans as it were story on the web and i literally threw up
6462066 at the time i was too naive to think what can i do about this i got sick to my stomach it was 25 years ago i didnt remember then
6462067 i only remembered a year and a half ago two years ago that she wrote me a letter afterwards
6462068 this womans sister had written michael that theres a story on gafni thats about to break
6462069 would i do it again of course not would i teach young men to behave differently in that situation of course i would but between that and re raising it and trying to wreck someones life with it is a long long distance
6462070 he asked me at the time i remember something like have you had affairs i said no which wasnt true i have had a bohemian lifestyle that didnt seem to be appropriate to share with gary why would i do that
6462071 i told him completely the truth of this early story which we discussed above i dont think that he believed me
6462072 kill the competition protect yourself from attack and pretend even to yourself that is was for noble motives
6462073 now i have a polygraph to support it i didnt then
6462074 the second story on the web as well is completely distorted in tone and substance thats also validated by polygraph
6462075 and i wasnt fully transparent with gary about what did transpire and how it played that was a mistake
6462076 the reason that happened was simple when it first took place immediately her advisor brought her to this particular rabbi who held less than my ennobled self interest in mind and i called a very close friend no names who was a significant figure in the community at the time as well as now and said this is what actually happened very very limited its been blown up in two days through the prism of this rabbi its become this huge archetypal original sin story which is not what it was the woman was strongly encouraged to i was in my youth then she was 16 she was strongly encouraged to kinda blow this story up
6462077 i feel the story was a mistake that any encounter with her at all was a mistake
6462078 the advice that i received at the time again im not passing off my responsibility for the advice but the advice i received very strongly from a very strong older sister person was she called the rabbi in question who was moving the story forward and she called me back and said listen this man does not have your self interest or any sense of decency healing or fair play in mind
6462079 his wife hates you because you represent a man that she had two major collapses while she worked for him and you evoke this man in her it is not rational later someone very close to this couple told me the same thing and said to me twenty years later that their
6462080 so when a group of people went to support me in a public letter right
6462081 as the years went on when i founded my organization in israel there were two female board members who i again consulted with about this issue
6462082 with great respect for everyone but vicki polin who says she sacrificed and murdered babies on an oprah in 1989 right
6462083 and and so and so both of these people advised me very very strongly that i was doing the only appropriate thing that could possibly be done right which is what i did
6462084 in retrospect i shouldve been more transparent on that one issue it wasnt something that seemed possible then the best advice i got said not to do it and ultimately the people who give us advice arent responsible for what we do we are so i take responsibility for that
6462085 what i fully and utterly reject is the pathologizing that some people all with less then wholesome agenda and motives have done on the hate blogs of the internet and other forums
6462086 its kind of like if i can use an analogy its kind of like mccarthyism this is a term that the colleague you mentioned dennis prager also uses sexual mccarthyism
6462087 sexual mccarthyism and the term was actually coined by alan dershowitz i thought i coined it two years ago and then i looked it up online and i was so disappointed right to see alan dershowitz had written a book by that name but sexual mccarthyism means you take the correct loathing that we have of sexual abuse but then you use it you actually abuse sexual abuse you use it for a series of other far more complex and dark agendas which you actually cant own and you cloak yourself in a respectable battle thats essentially what mccarthy did and thats what alan dershowitz calls sexual mccarthyism
6462088 so to take a sexual mistake anyones whether its yours or mine or the rabbis or the editors and then transform it into this larger than life archetypal original sin motivated and driven by a kind of sexual hysteria is deeply problematic from an ethical perspective
6462089 i feel again to borrow dennis pragers and warren farrels phrase my personal experience is that i feel like ive been name raped
6462090 when i say name raped i dont in any way in any way minimize the experience of rape
6462091 so while violent rape is in a class by itself prager points out that when he talks about name rape people would call him and say how can you say that its offensive to women and he would say on his show what would you feel if this happened to your son
6462092 to have your kind of your sexuality distorted and demonized for 25 years and then put on the web in a distorted and demonized way and until i took these polygraphs i knew of no way of responding to it what could i do
6462093 it wasnt until i hired a fantastic group of lawyers here in salt lake city who said polygraph it
6462094 now as you said in the car everyone has a perspective but not all perspectives are equal you cant distort a past story for example you cant say im vicki polin i didnt like my parents i had a really hard childhood so therefore there was a jewish satanic cult that murdered babies
6462095 no thats not ok theres actually not a jewish satanic cult around america that murders babies thats not true
6462096 thats not a perspective problem thats an empirical problem if i can borrow your phrase
6462097 i would be willing to sit with anyone certainly with these two 25 and 30 year old stories in a facilitated context and create closure
6462098 every time i hear about it on the web she keeps getting younger id be 23 and she becomes 12
6462099 i went with her to her ninth grade classes at ramaz high school ill never never mention her name its inappropriate
6462100 i loved this woman with all my soul right i know she mocks that im completely aware of that but actually she wrote me a letter afterwards fully validating that she had the same experience right
6462101 so can i go back and own my part in that story of course i can did i not understand certain things then right of course i didnt but to move from there to some kind of demonization will actually demonize every man and woman in america
6462102 every man and woman in america who has a healthy sexuality has a complex story someplace somewhere which can be distorted and demonized
6462103 enough theory did you have any idea when the gary rosenblatt story came out that this was just the beginning of your nightmare that this was just the blood in the water
6462104 to fast forward at a particular time i got divorced from my third wife
6462105 im sniffing a rose while marc is crying in his soul
6462106 luke were not going to debate this this is where your blog did a profound disservice the whole negative blog thing created a kind of crazy environment
6462107 my site is the first one that comes up i own you
6462108 you dont anymore and hopefully youll move beyond that too laughing
6462109 thats a problem tom tugend wrote a thousand articles in his life i was interested in an article he wrote i googled him and the first thing that came up was luke and tom
6462110 its simply because it is the best work as reflected by other peoples links to it i do nothing to optimize i just try to put out the best story other people link to me
6462111 if you give people tabloid how many people have you seen stop to read the national enquirer the equivalent of that online is people like luke ford
6462112 that drives luke ford to the top of tom tugend whos written a thousand other great articles but luke fords tom tugend interview becomes first thats the power of the national enquirer and thats the tabloid coliseum playing in the blogosphere you should not be proud of that my friend
6462113 luke i want to say this to you directly if you want to come up second and third on a person fourth fifth say what you say i think its radically irresponsible in a thousand ways but you do what you do but i think theres something wrong in a virtual world to take tom tugends first place hes got a lifes work hes got a world hes not someone i know i dont have an investment but theres something off on that that may be kind of funny to you blessings
6462114 we can link that back to the beginning of our interview about lukes view of the world
6462115 im doing a movie this year on the shadow of the internet youll be a guest
6462116 im here to talk to your best and most beautiful side and im here to talk to the person who got a huge rush when you saved lives i dont buy into the luke ford monster view i just dont buy it im talking to the evolved luke ford that i write about in soul prints that you hate so lets go back to our story
6462117 so gary rosenblatts story comes out but then i get all this information that portrays you as the biggest creep from people who go back 25 years on you tell me garys story comes out then i pile on how was that for you
6462118 ill just say it this way luke angelina jolie says this about the tabloids 95 of what you write is just crap it is distorted i could take you through it line by line stories about me
6462119 i mean come sit in my basement where my books are
6462120 i could probably trace each line that you write to who said it from what situation you collected a bunch of half baked things and gave them a creep spin well call it the luke creep spin and there it went it was so inaccurate it was so distorted its not even possible to respond to
6462121 i told you i read your thing once a couple of years ago im sure its changed but probably the same core is there
6462122 part of the reason you do the creep spin is that thats your basic view of life right
6462123 thank you thats important your basic view of life is that people are creeps
6462124 my basic view of life is that luke ford is beautiful that doesnt mean that luke ford doesnt do really creepy stuff but i believe in that higher person and thats where we part ways
6462125 thats our sacred contract today we agree its beyond past and future its in the present
6462126 i said to this particular person who talked to me about whos a major mover and shaker in israel well do this and then well have these people come out from the closet and do their old stuff
6462127 i said that doesnt seem like such a great idea to me that doesnt seem like the best way to spend a sunday afternoon
6462128 a particular rabbi called him and said to him reopen the gafni thing a back bencher old friend of his so he reopened the gafni thing
6462129 once that story happened we realized it was going to get distorted again in israel the same two old stories being distorted so we then initiated the story in maariv the story was told relatively accurately then it was over so we thought
6462130 im not living this story im teaching every day im working with people im fundraising im lending people money im helping people im trying to be a mentch the story is like a sidebar sometimes it gets annoying but mostly its like a fly were swatting sorry to analogize you to a fly
6462131 there was a particular person im not going to mention names and ill ask you not to as well i want to hold everyones confidentiality there was a particular person who i was involved with at the end of my marriage who had something to do with the marriages breakup
6462132 i had no sense whatsoever then nor did the people involved at the time of anything transgressive about the relationships
6462133 if i can go deep for a second theres bad secrets and theres confidentiality what people do in a artificial way is say that secrets are bad thats not true confidentiality is sacred father sleeping with his daughter sordid secret is bad
6462134 theres this notion in victim feminism of breaking the silence but actually when you are holding sacred confidentiality and you break that thats not a great thing to do thats not breaking the silence thats just breaking a promise to cloak that as breaking the silence is absurd
6462135 i did not for a second not for a second luke see the rupture coming
6462136 the truth is i was moving so fast i was naive it didnt occur to me that this would be hurtful in a way that it obviously was hurtful to women for that actually i greatly regret
6462137 the question is what do we do with our hurt were all hurt
6462138 i remember someone said to me about a year ago when i said something about the situation she said but this or that person was hurt and i said hurt doesnt give a person the license to murder
6462139 thats something the earlier philosopher dennis prager you quoted understands
6462140 in the mafia when youre hurt rub em out my dignity was offended
6462141 but actually thats not the way it works when you evolve levels of consciousness i take my hurt and i make it into compassion
6462142 i know that youre a biblical kinda guy so can i give you a text here
6462143 you shall not oppress the stranger for you were strangers in the land of egypt
6462144 i dont think anyone intentionally filed an untrue complaint but there was a hysteria
6462145 there is one thing im going to say which she said that was completely inappropriate she said he told me the old stories were true not at all true
6462146 because everyone is now self protecting themselves in case they god forbid get accused of not protecting women everyone moves into a self protective stance lets sacrifice gafni and go home i basically became the sacrificial lamb
6462147 and if that is the only thing i have to say thats victim talk right thats not the only thing i have to say im not sitting here saying only the bastards did it
6462148 a im saying the police complaints werent true i dont even know if the women made police complaints maybe they were distorted in the press so im not blaming the women im just saying this whole thing that got reported just wasnt true
6462149 b it never should happened that way there shouldve been a healing circle we shouldve talked to each other it shouldve been facilitated it shouldve been handled privately right all those things
6462150 c i had a part in the contribution system that created it i didnt see it coming the relationships shouldve been either transparent or nonexistent
6462151 ive actually thought about it people pushed me luke for a year to take responsibility
6462152 for what for people whove lied about the nature of my sexuality what exactly am i supposed to take responsibility for of course youre in the new age world its your creation youve got to take responsibility
6462153 but youve got to take responsibility for what youve got to take responsibility for clearly i had a part in the contribution system that created this hopefully that will deepen something in me
6462154 let me go to maybe the last part as we wind down this is what you asked me outside in our sacred context i brought you out here i dont want to bring you out here on a pretext i told you ill talk in the first person
6462155 its not even imaginable how painful this was literally people leave you to die and they think you left them in connection with why are you going silent
6462156 youve got a group of people saying theyre breaking the silence when im the only person being silent
6462157 if i wasnt able to recover all this information not only my harddrive and not only my email and my instant messages but an enormous amount of other information which im not going into here which proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that catalyst magazine article which was a very serious investigative article that looked very carefully at all this first person information as written if i had not been able to collect that i would be completely and totally vulnerable
6462158 now in the beginning i wrote this letter as you correctly ask why did you write that letter i took all the sickness that happened upon myself
6462159 i wrote the letter as i said on my website for four reasons a out of complete shock and trauma id like to tell you i saw this coming i didnt see a thing coming i was completely i knew there was stuff out there as you said earlier that was your image there was blood in the water
6462160 i had no sense that this level of what i experienced as betrayal could happen
6462161 im not accusing anyone of betrayal but i experienced a massive betrayal i had no idea it could happen none
6462162 first off i was so traumatized i literally couldnt breathe
6462163 at a certain point i came to salt lake and i called up a friend here in salt lake and i said i literally dont want to live out the day
6462164 my whole life has been about service this is not service
6462165 i was just crying uncontrollably i just shut my eyes and prayed to god i shouldnt wake up i called my friend and said hey im done she said let me get it straight are you committing suicide or are you just dying i said im just dying
6462166 three or four times i literally thought my life was leaving my body i was teetering on the edge there for whatever reason almost unfortunately i woke up
6462167 i could tell this as a gafni early childhood story
6462168 every time i would talk to someone i wont mention any names but serious people and they would say this is what happened this is why it happened and if you dont take my advice youre gone
6462169 an hour later id talk to someone else and theyd tell me the exact opposite this is what happened and if you dont take my advice youre gone
6462170 little by little im trying to describe to you the experience because thats what you asked me my actual experience of life began to change in other words luke ford became not important hes saying that whatever
6462171 i began to live i want to be really careful here because i dont want to claim it as spiritual greatness it didnt come from greatness it didnt come from practice it came from either die or this two choices i began to live completely here and now
6462172 i remember there was a waiter that smiled at me not even a waitress like this morning and i remember he smiled at me and ohmigod i was just basking someone just smiled at me
6462173 you just hugged a tree outside if i can reveal that luke ford was outside hugging a tree
6462174 and thats how i began to live and to move into a different space i want to be really clear i dont want to over claim something its not that i didnt go back to fear i did but i would go back into that space
6462175 what gradually began to happen is that i would live more and more in that space and less and less in fear it was a gift it was a gift i would never have gotten
6462176 i love to teach i love to chant i love to meditate i love to live in divine space you can tell that about me you dont need me to tell you i love soul prints youre a shmuck that you dont like it
6462177 would i therefore not reverse it all of course i would reverse it all of course i would nobody would invite that level of pain right ohmigod
6462178 that gives you the sense of the story i want to wrap up by answering a question you asked earlier
6462179 what caused this in my understanding four different things caused this the fifth is the most powerful which is mystery meaning its beyond me theres a mystery here and theres a human arrogance when you work it all out
6462180 my four are just in the realm of small understanding then theres big mystery
6462181 part of what caused it is my own lack of wholeness
6462182 clearly my own lack of wholeness is a piece of the story
6462183 to see this 25 year old gafni hunt that created a fertile ground for this it created a prism through which everything can be viewed through that prism
6462184 unless were talking about violent sexuality or prepubescent molestation almost everything in between particularly adult sexuality is viewed through a prism if the prisms loving its good if people lay a negative prism you can make anything bad
6462185 there was a prism that was developed over 25 years that a couple of these people from 25 years ago participated in and this fed into the prism
6462186 so a my own lack of wholeness b malice c this prism
6462187 those are all different ways to go of course what is going to happen is that everyone will pick one prism and say this is it this is gafni lets demonize him but those are all incomplete completion integrates all of them together
6462188 my way forward is not going to be the way of attack
6462189 i couldnt let the women didnt make those false accusations
6462190 at the same time i made a decision to take the high road im not going to publish peoples private correspondence im not going to attack people im going to own whatever im able to own in terms of my own responsibility and move on in a way thats healing
6462191 i cant contact any of the people in the story
6462192 i know it is very hard for people to climb down the tree
6462193 my primary future direction is in writing and movies i have a huge interest in social activism there are two organizations around that are very involved in combating genocide and human trafficking sexual slavery two issues that have preoccupied me my entire life
6462194 im committed to being a lover im committed to loving people im committed to not let my heart close because of this im committed to not becoming bitter im committed to keep an open heart
6462195 if i can leave you with one phrase im sure youre going to hate it luke
6462196 but as luke says that he hates it let me make this clear to everyone listening hes sitting there hes been feeling the fragrance of a flower for the past hour he does hug trees that part of you might love this
6462197 when something happens to us in love we can make it an insult and have to insult the person back it can become a ritual of rejection
6462198 the other way to experience rejection is as a wound of love not as an insult of love can we practice the wounds of love
6462199 with that i want to thank you for coming its a beautiful day lchaim
6462200 is religion a force for good in the modern world
6462201 the ramifications of this whole episode on me and my family have been devastating and the mayors actions and the superintendents public silence has forced me to recognize that i have neither the trust confidence or respect of the mayor nor the superintendent

6462208 people have come to me with other ideas but lingerie is a passion for me and just like music and acting i cant do it unless i put 100 percent into it
6462209 it makes you feel incredible and offers variety as diverse as the women who will wear it
6462210 theres something for every woman and thats very important to us
6462211 ive always hated when lingerie is uncomfortable so the fit and comfort was key
6462212 what a mess we are i thought but this is usually where any hope of improvement begins acknowledging the mess when i am well i know not to mess with mess right away i try to let silence and time work their magic you dont get far without grinding your teeth and heavy breathing you noodle around to warm up and you meander to find out if there are any improvisations that call to you

6462219 we all got together and agreed to this form of government
6462220 if we all have inalienable rights how can some men vote to take away the rights of others
6462221 how does the fact that ten men may choose to join together for their common protection impose upon the eleventh man any obligation to go along with them
6462222 if they majority are in favor of something that makes it right
6462223 suppose three muggers confront you on the street and say we want your money but dont worry were going to let you vote on whether or not you should give it to us if this group votes three to one in favor of taking your money does this legitimize its actions
6462224 it has to involve more than just a few people
6462225 majority rule is just the way our government is set up
6462226 how does this or any other system of government acquire the legitimacy to impose such processes upon those who do not choose to be bound by it
6462227 if you dont like it you should leave the country
6462228 for only in facing hard uncomfortable questions will we be able to overcome the dependencies on authority that we have accepted for our lives
6462229 a woman can do alot of things for her boy teach him manners respect values how to treat a woman the importance of school etc the one thing she can never teach him is how to be a man only a man can do that
6462230 i know i can go to kevin for advice about this he would know and wont lead me astray
6462231 one morning i shot an elephant in my pajamas how he got into my pajamas i don t know

6462233 bramley was not interested in ufos when he started researching the origins of human warfare however his research eventually led him to what he shares in this book evidence that alien visitors have conspired to dominate humankind through violence and chaos since the beginning of time
6462234 the chilling truth about extraterrestrial infiltation and the conspiracy to keep humankind in chains as a result of seven years of intensive research william bramley has uncovered the sinister thread that links humanitys darkest events from the wars of the ancient pharaohs to the assassination of jfk in this remarkable shocking and absolutely compelling work bramley presents disturbing evidence of an alien presence on earth extraterrestrial visitors who have conspired to dominate humankind through violence and chaos since the beginning of time a conspiracy which continues to this very day

6462236 the musical spectrum at this years festival was particularly broad but the xlc system proved just as effective for pop acts as for the subtle country folk of ilse de lange the response we received for this production was truly outstanding
6462237 ev has a reputation for being reliable and delivering outstanding sound and fully lived up to that at this years jad
6462238 the sound was praised in the most fulsome terms by audience members artists and tour managers alike a great compliment for the sound crew
6462239 the american vocalist solomon burke celebrated a stirring soul communion at the straubing jazz festival
6462240 frankly the decision of nancy pelosi to go to meet with assad in syria is one which i find outrageous
6462241 could hardly have chosen a better way to undermine us foreign policy
6462242 this picture disgusts me what message is nancy pelosi trying to send
6462243 its best to raise the white flag over the middle east
6462244 we cant believe that a majority of americans impatient though they are with the iraq war thought they were voting for this last november
6462245 nancy pelosi tends to forget that there is an executive branch
6462246 just an old box i have been sitting on it for as long as i can remember
6462247 my or our god is the only true god and your god is false
6462248 one day when this that or the other happens i am going to be okay happy at peace
6462249 plays only a subordinate part in the brief decisive phase of the creative act itself
6462250 1 so i would say that the simple reason why the majority of scientists are not creative is not because they dont know how to think but because they dont know how to stop thinking
6462251 i would have liked to go to the as defending olympic champion and i cant believe im standing here disappointed with silver but i am
6462252 i cant complain about the silver but im a winner and i had been undefeated coming into this this is the one i didnt want to lose
6462253 i had to work to get back into the lead two or three times it was a tough competition
6462254 we very much hope that the pope will come to china relations with the
6462255 we hope he can visit china as soon as possible
6462256 that would be good for the however the first step is to establish diplomatic relations
6462257 several important problems have not yet been resolved but the holy see wants to continue a loyal and constructive dialogue
6462258 what i saw was a powerful demonstration of an impulse and need for african american men to come together to recognize each other and affirm our rightful place in society
6462259 many of the jews who own homes the apartments in the black community we considered them bloodsuckers because they took from our community and built their community but didnt offer anything back to our community
6462260 the jews dont like farrakhan so they call me hitler well thats a good name hitler was a very great man
6462261 how many other african americans or european americans do you know that can get one million people together on the mall he is one of the most important voices in the 20th and 21st century
6462262 i am not going to put down louis farrakhan any more than mandela would put down fidel castro
6462263 im sorry there is no more room on the boat
6462264 i know you guys have 2 cars can you guys meet us there
6462265 yeah we have 2 cars but everyones drunk we only have one sober person to drive and thats ken
6462266 reflects the fact that we are still in the early stages of a five year turnaround
6462267 the changes wont suddenly be obvious on a particular day or date but i continue to strongly believe that the results of progress made to date and the strategies being planned will deliver value to our shareholders and our customers
6462268 the companys outlook is for continuing solid performances across most businesses with the earnings outlook for resources in 2008 09 particularly strong
6462269 son hardly any one on the face of the planet can help you or accompany you for the rest of your life they might leave they might get tired of you they might pass away they might have their own matters thats why my son you should learn how to handle everything by yourself and most of all you can live without every precious and important thing or person in your life namely you should never seem to have anything that if you lost it youd care too much
6462270 its really exciting to see the enthusiasm for the concert
6462271 the verilog ams 2 3 language release is an important milestone for our technical committee and the industry at large
6462272 a unified verilog ams language integrated with the ieee verilog standard improves ams design and will result in an increased acceptance of the standard
6462273 accelleras ams standard is a reality due to the enormous efforts of our subcommittee members who are driven by the goal to improve the productivity of ams designers and the quality of mixed signal designs
6462274 if your faith is as big as a mustard seed you could have said to this mulberry tree be pulled up by the roots and planted in the sea and it would have obeyed you
6462275 we are what we think through thought we build and destroy the world
6462276 we are what we think your imagination can do more harm than your worst enemy

6462280 reducing or freezing credit lines may be a prudent response for lenders managing their risks
6462281 but for consumers who use home equity lines to pay for major purchases or to pay off higher priced credit having their source of funding reduced can result in significant financial hardship
6462282 we have told banks that depending on a borrowers creditworthiness and overall financial circumstances it may be possible to offer alternative types of credit or other arrangements that can minimize the negative effects of credit line reductions or suspensions
6462283 actels sae as9100 certification eases the part acquisition process for our aerospace and avionics customers around the world

6462285 its not something id want to put on national television
6462286 it does take a long time to get working properly again
6462287 we try and preserve jobs we are a growth story one of the few airlines in the world that is a growth story
6462288 there were tonnes of tracks especially in inner cities slough surbiton hounslow it was a huge scene in the late eighties the nationals at hounslow would have thousands
6462289 it was very much a sport that depended on volunteers and families
6462290 everyones purse strings tightened in the early 1990s and it hit bmx hard
6462291 after 40 years making the headlines in the literary world it is good that the man booker prize is now taking a lead in the world of new technology
6462292 we are very sorry if anyone is offended by the language used in jacqueline wilsons my sister jodie
6462293 jacqueline wilson aims to reflect the realities of modern life including dialogue in her books children do hear a wide variety of language in the playground and through this learn what is and isnt acceptable and also how language demonstrates mood and feelings in the context of the character we felt the word was used in a way that accurately portrayed how children like jodie and her friends would speak to each other and it also contributed to the readers understanding of how jodie felt in the situation
6462294 the book is aimed at children aged ten and over and we felt it was an acceptable word for that age range especially as it is commonly used in a way that is removed from its original meaning we have sold over 150 000 copies of the book since publication in march this year and have only received 3 complaints in light of these complaints we had already decided to amend the text when the book reprints so new editions of the book do not contain it
6462295 thanks to our diversified international portfolio trading in the first half was much stronger than we might have expected
6462296 the harry potter thing is useful because there will be a lot of people whove never been to the theater before and if we can bring them to the theater thats amazing
6462297 they were show horses and they were such beautiful creatures
6462298 so powerful i personally think blinding so many horses is impossible because if you blind one itll kick you in the head and youre out
6462299 there are more people in therapy in this country than england so you get it
6462300 he has the most brilliant encyclopedic knowledge that anyone could ever possess and he never imposes it on you
6462301 so instead of his dad being a communist and such we leave it at they had a great marriage
6462302 the play asks a question why and its a question for which no one has the answer
6462303 his default setting is that hes got this malcolm mcdowell rage so when you show his human side hes more interesting
6462304 if you saw us in rehearsal you might think it was a comedy
6462305 offended mothers were calling up and saying i shouldnt be doing this that they werent going to go see it
6462306 ok dont see it theyre treating it like its pornography and its not its only seven minutes at the end of the play when im naked and im 19 now
6462307 youre in there and there are these hooves flying around and im naked by that point its terrifying that scene is one of the most shocking pieces of theater and i deserve very little credit for that those horses are amazing
6462308 i asked him how do you memorize all those lines
6462309 and he told me to just learn them in rehearsal so i did about a month before by the time opening night came i knew everyone elses lines too
6462310 and it would be really hard to do this without him were both onstage the entire length of the play were there for each others scenes as spectators so we developed a kind of kinship
6462311 were never in situations in films where we have to save each other
6462312 or to stop each other from making public embarrassments of ourselves you know when an actor pauses whether its for dramatic effect or its a forgotten line you can see the panic behind the eyes
6462313 it only happened once but my horseman will kemp had me on his shoulders and he was supposed to run and jump off a block
6462314 but he missed his footing and instead of hitting here he hit there and the blocks slid across the stage the whole audience went whoa and i was just laughing out of pure terror but he managed to keep me on his shoulders
6462315 its the same reason to go see live music for those little moments
6462316 it falls short of being four 1 records in a row i think with the jonas brothers second week
6462317 half of that is more than what well sell and its good for those guys all i can say is weve been here for 10 years and this is our sixth record i feel proud to be able to say that if its not 1 its not 1 what are you going to do
6462318 but its just a different version of the boy band thing all over again
6462319 we went in and started writing and the songs that were coming out werent the heaviest songs but they were really good songs
6462320 we wrote 14 songs and there are 13 on the album there was only one song that didnt make it and it wasnt because it didnt stand up i just couldnt come up with anything to sing over it musically it was one of my favorite songs on the record i just couldnt come up with anything that was worthy of it in a melody and lyrical sense the songs we were writing were great songs we couldnt cast them aside and say no those arent heavy enough if we had wed probably still be there writing
6462321 i hope theyre happy surprised and that they can just realize that we wrote the best songs we could
6462322 we work very hard to grow as a band and i think we made a pretty good step this time
6462323 the only thing i know that really changed for me was when i should have been upstairs in my room working on songs i was playing with the kids
6462324 is there anything else you think you may need for college
6462325 oh wow yeah i cant believe we forgot the peanut butter im going to need something to get me through ya know
6462326 i love you mommy thank you for everything you have done so much for me i wouldnt be here without you
6462327 e contiene un djset con tutti i grandi successi ke ci hanno accompagnato in queste splendide serate estive ovviamente tutte mixate da me d
6462328 till that point of time i think some of the capex in infrastructure projects might get deferred
6462329 in that kind of environment may be its worthwhile to stay put in cash
6462330 at the moment there is no slowdown but i think two quarters down the line may be we should see some slowdown in the order books
6462331 please do not test the georgian states patience lets give peace gt and dialogue a chance
6462332 i got to be honest ive been thinking about recruiting jamaica since i saw that stuff
6462333 ive been to jamaica and let me tell you something
6462334 please do not test the georgian states patience lets give peace gt and dialogue a chance
6462335 mike is evolving into one of the bright young pitching stars in the national league no question about it
6462336 from where he came from early in the season we were questioning whether or not to have him on the staff questioning whether or not to keep him in the rotation and hes pretty much been a huge part of the success weve had here and thats a tribute to him
6462337 there was never any issue with his mechanics or anything of that type he just needed to cross that line and have some success
6462338 o objetivo fazer esta refinaria 100 da petrobras n o termos s cios vamos avan ar ao m ximo na constru o dela para que seja 100 da petrobras
6462339 a partir de agora temos 120 dias para fechar os termos do compromisso para a constru o da refinaria
6462340 its great to be a football fan in the big apple
6462341 please do not test the georgian states patience lets give peace gt and dialogue a chance
6462342 if you are going out of business you dont go down with the ship you get another ship for us its natural gas
6462343 building new wind generation facilities and better utilizing our natural gas resources can replace more than one third of our foreign oil imports in 10 years
6462344 gore asked if we could we join together and do something
6462345 i told him no because global warming is on page two for me page one is foreign oil
6462346 the u s will be importing a significant amount of oil its a step toward energy independence in that it expands renewable energy production but i think framing this debate in terms of energy independence isnt the way to go if you want to take a populist angle on this pushing the very real benefits that wind power and renewables in general can have in local economies stands on much more solid ground
6462347 museum administration may sound pretty deadly but take it from us in our combined fourty years of experience in museum administration we have been aggravated consternated exhilarated frustrated and stimulated but we have never been bored
6462348 the mission of museums include colecting and preserving all manner of human made artifacts and natural specimens living and nonliving as well as exhibiting interpreting and educating in order to expand our knowledge about ourselves our society and our world it is the aim of museums to be a resource for humankind and to foster an informed appreciation of our diverse world it is also the goal of museums to preserve this heritage for posterity
6462349 i think this olympics is the jamaican olympics no disrespect to the americans
6462350 dominating like we are its no surprise i know its been crazy because weve been on the podium a lot
6462351 then i went to grab it and there was nothing its kind of the way its been happening to me this olympics
6462352 hes a humble guy but i know its my job to get the guy the baton and i didnt do that
6462353 if people want to assess the blame to me thats ok
6462354 i mean i can take whatever it is that people are going to dish out we had good chemistry the hand was back there she was there i dont know what happened
6462355 the world under 20 championship is a spectacular event that were extremely pleased to be hosting again
6462356 we had interest in this event from more than 20 different entities across the country weve narrowed the field to three very worthy finalists and look forward to reaching a decision before the end of the year
6462357 it will be a real treat for sports fans in our country to have the world junior championship back in the united states
6462358 its a very special event with an extremely high level of talent
6462359 the last time we hosted the world junior championship back in 2005 fans got to see players like phil kessel sidney crosby and alexander ovechkin to name just a few
6462360 the bottom line for hockey fans is outside of the olympics the world junior championship is probably the best international tournament theyll ever get to witness
6462361 the fact that these expenditures are not only so large but are undisclosed is extremely troubling
6462362 are trying to influence the elections with millions of dollars that the public cant trace
6462363 i hope to inspire everyone and ask where is our march where are our petitions where the fuck are our minds i know there are a few petitions out there that i have signed but its not enough
6462364 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
6462365 i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
6462366 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
6462367 you know hes got a longer track record than that
6462368 del que se hace pasar por progresista se dice que
6462369 y vistas la cosas en este pa s parece que ha habido siempre muchos progresistas o zurdos ideol gicos interesados contando con la habilidad que algunos diestros tienen para cambiar y manejar la izquierda cuando la situaci n lo aconseja
6462370 i appreciate all you guys taking the time to be here
6462371 and begin discussions on the deployment of an international peacekeeping force to south ossetia and the implications for natos future relationship with russia
6462372 continuing to develop renewable energy is a key component of president bushs strategy to reduce americas dependence on foreign oil
6462373 this meeting is an opportunity for business owners citizens and agricultural producers to discuss the best ways to harness the untapped renewable energy resources in rural areas
6462374 if we analyze the problem from the point of view of the wage increase we can see that in time the employee will again complain of high prices and thats why we propose an analysis of what are the basic dominican staples and stabilize prices from that
6462375 ebs is a major step for our customers and delivers storage capabilities that any big iron san user would die for
6462376 through the rightscale dashboard customers can easily and automatically manage large volumes of data and saas vendors can run single tenant virtual applications on behalf of their customers that require robust data storage in the cloud ebs allows smaller companies enterprise organizations and startups to get immediate access to a new set of powerful redundant cloud storage assets they didnt have time or money to build before
6462377 as long as the commodity side of the business is not being detrimental to our results were satisfied with that
6462378 that was obviously not the picture in this quarter and it wont be next quarter either
6462379 training for and taking part in the adidas womens 5k challenge is not just a brilliant way to help you look and feel great but it can also be the first steps you take towards leading a healthier and more active lifestyle
6462380 los cr ticos reales del cine me dieron las 10 estrellas en la actuaci n dijeron que soy un actor nato
6462381 la gente me ha aceptado a mi me sorprendi porque era la primera vez que actuaba pero siempre supe que ten a el potencial de hacerlo porque nosotros los raperos somos actores naturales
6462382 est en ti tomar la decisi n de decir que no y si te adentras atenerte a las consecuencias porque todo mundo sabe a lo que conlleva
6462383 matt y lucy damon tuvieron una beb llamada gia zavala el mi rcoles 20 de agosto todos est n muy bien
6462384 it is a great way to showcase our local restaurants and allow attendees to sample some great cuisine
6462385 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6462386 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
6462387 what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to decive
6462388 if those logs for medications were in those records i would think thats probably why he would do it to cover up the fact that he was taking their medication
6462389 thompson health has strict procedures in place to protect all patient information it was because of our own internal monitoring process that we were able to immediately identify this activity collaborate with the authorities and to take additional steps to protect our patients and their medical records
6462390 certainly she is in all of our prayers i think people all over the nation who know her and love her as i do are sending up prayers on her behalf
6462391 she is a real star in the united states congress
6462392 will allow consumers to enjoy rich internet applications designed for the tv while watching their favorite tv programs
6462393 will enable consumers to engage in a variety of experiences such as watching videos tracking their favorite stocks or sports teams interacting with friends or staying current on news and information
6462394 tv will fundamentally change how we talk about imagine and experience the internet
6462395 no longer just a passive experience unless the viewer wants it that way intel and yahoo are proposing a way where the tv and internet are as interactive and seamless as possible
6462396 coronas leadership at his familys sunshine state bank earned him a lifetime ban from the banking industry thanks to millions of dollars in shady loans and startup money from a drug smuggler

6462399 dr lanasa will make an excellent president for donnelly college
6462400 he has a big heart and i think his presence at donnelly will both inspire and motivate i expect great things for donnelly under his tenure
6462401 educational attainment and equality are the most pressing issues facing both our region and country now and in the coming decades
6462402 i have been tremendously impressed by the support and commitment of the faculty and staff the archdiocese and sisters as well as the community at large who all ensure donnelly fulfills its mission to provide students access to the education they deserve
6462403 perhaps companies will want to put wind turbines atop bridges and skyscrapers or use the enormous potential of powerful offshore winds miles out off the atlantic coasts
6462404 i think it would be a thing of beauty if when lady liberty looks out on the horizon she not only welcomes new immigrants but lights their way with a torch powered by an ocean wind farm
6462405 in 1999 2001 and 2003 when congress temporarily killed the credits the number of new turbines dropped dramatically
6462406 we believe more information can only help consumers make informed decisions and help us to make changes

6462416 nous ne pouvons pas nous permettre quun second munich se reproduise quand la communait internationale sest effac e devant hitler
6462417 while not all companies have yet to follow suit both shareholders and the securities and exchange commission can be pleased with the trend
6462418 apparently people dont like the truth but i do like it i like it because it upsets a lot of people if you show them enough times that their arguments are bullshit then maybe just once one of them will say oh wait a minute i was wrong i live for that happening rare i assure you
6462419 my earliest memory is shouting at what and for what reason i dont know probably a tantrum or i may have been rehearsing i was always an early starter
6462420 i dont understand people who believe that if you ignore something itll go away thats completely wrong if its ignored it gathers strength europe ignored hitler for twenty years as a result he slaughtered a quarter of the world
6462421 inherited hatred i e hatred your parents schooled you in is not only stupid it is destructive why make your only driving force hate seems really fucking dumb to me
6462422 if you think you are too old to rock n roll then you are
6462423 alcohol education that mandates abstinence as the only legal option has not resulted in significant constructive behavioral change among our students

6462430 i really liked the leadership and demeanor billy showed in the spring but he didnt take anything for granted at that point he really took charge over the summer during our conditioning program and the players workouts that was where he earned the respect and confidence of his teammates

6462441 are just not going to good schools and no incentive is going to fix that
6462442 im just dumbfounded that they can regard this as an achievement or as a great improvement or as something worth spending the money on im surprised that that kind of money that kind of incentives doesnt produce better results it sort of undercuts the argument that the problem is the question of motivation

6462602 in fact we need to give practical expression to the dictum in victory plan for defeat

6462605 this bill enjoins us to make a concerted effort to ensure continued and uninterruptible supply of energy
6462606 we will do this firstly by putting in place measures for the holding of strategic or contingency energy feed stocks and energy carriers at a national level and secondly by putting in place measures to ensure adequate investment in energy infrastructure as well as the maintenance thereof
6462607 we are responding through this bill to the outcry of all key industry stakeholders on the availability and in some instances the paucity of data and information used by state owned entities like eskom in deciding whether special rates should be effected on certain customers

6462652 but i trust i can behave like a gentleman in either condition may i smoke
6462653 i must ask you to forgive me all these formalities
6462654 now we are quite cosy so let us talk properly now no human words can give you any notion of why i brought you here it was one of those quite arbitrary emotions like jumping off a cliff or falling in love suffice it to say that you were an inexpressibly irritating fellow and to do you justice you are still i would break twenty oaths of secrecy for the pleasure of taking you down a peg that way you have of lighting a cigar would make a priest break the seal of confession well you said that you were quite certain i was not a serious anarchist does this place strike you as being serious
6462655 it does seem to have a moral under all its gaiety
6462656 but may i ask you two questions you need not fear to give me information because as you remember you very wisely extorted from me a promise not to tell the police a promise i shall certainly keep so it is in mere curiosity that i make my queries first of all what is it really all about what is it you object to you want to abolish government
6462657 we do not only want to upset a few despotisms and police regulations that sort of anarchism does exist but it is a mere branch of the nonconformists we dig deeper and we blow you higher we wish to deny all those arbitrary distinctions of vice and virtue honour and treachery upon which mere rebels base themselves the silly sentimentalists of the french revolution talked of the rights of man we hate rights as we hate wrongs we have abolished right and wrong
6462658 i hope you will abolish them too they are much more troublesome to me
6462659 in all your present acts and surroundings there is a scientific attempt at secrecy i have an aunt who lived over a shop but this is the first time i have found people living from preference under a public house you have a heavy iron door you cannot pass it without submitting to the humiliation of calling yourself mr chamberlain you surround yourself with steel instruments which make the place if i may say so more impressive than homelike may i ask why after taking all this trouble to barricade yourselves in the bowels of the earth you then parade your whole secret by talking about anarchism to every silly woman in saffron park
6462660 i told you i was a serious anarchist and you did not believe me nor do they believe me unless i took them into this infernal room they would not believe me
6462661 when first i became one of the new anarchists i tried all kinds of respectable disguises i dressed up as a bishop i read up all about bishops in our anarchist pamphlets in superstition the vampire and priests of prey i certainly understood from them that bishops are strange and terrible old men keeping a cruel secret from mankind i was misinformed when on my first appearing in episcopal gaiters in a drawing room i cried out in a voice of thunder down down presumptuous human reason they found out in some way that i was not a bishop at all i was nabbed at once then i made up as a millionaire but i defended capital with so much intelligence that a fool could see that i was quite poor then i tried being a major now i am a humanitarian myself but i have i hope enough intellectual breadth to understand the position of those who like nietzsche admire violence the proud mad war of nature and all that you know i threw myself into the major i drew my sword and waved it constantly i called out blood abstractedly like a man calling for wine i often said let the weak perish it is the law well well it seems majors dont do this i was nabbed again at last i went in despair to the president of the central anarchist council who is the greatest man in europe
6462662 that is his greatness caesar and napoleon put all their genius into being heard of and they were heard of he puts all his genius into not being heard of and he is not heard of but you cannot be for five minutes in the room with him without feeling that caesar and napoleon would have been children in his hands
6462663 but whenever he gives advice it is always something as startling as an epigram and yet as practical as the bank of england i said to him what disguise will hide me from the world what can i find more respectable than bishops and majors he looked at me with his large but indecipherable face you want a safe disguise do you you want a dress which will guarantee you harmless a dress in which no one would ever look for a bomb i nodded he suddenly lifted his lions voice why then dress up as an anarchist you fool he roared so that the room shook nobody will ever expect you to do anything dangerous then and he turned his broad back on me without another word i took his advice and have never regretted it i preached blood and murder to those women day and night and by god they would let me wheel their perambulators
6462664 i feel somehow as if you were my mother syme
6462665 i feel that i can confide anything to you as you have promised to tell nobody in fact i will confide to you something that i would not say in so many words to the anarchists who will be coming to the room in about ten minutes we shall of course go through a form of election but i dont mind telling you that it is practically certain what the result will be
6462666 it is almost a settled thing that i am to be thursday
6462667 as a matter of fact everything is ready for me on this table
6462668 i have only to get the form of election finished
6462669 then i snatch up this cloak and stick stuff these other things into my pocket step out of a door in this cavern which opens on the river where there is a steam tug already waiting for me and then then oh the wild joy of being thursday
6462670 that i think you are quite a decent fellow why do i positively like you gregory
6462671 a promise i swore before god that i would not tell your secret to the police will you swear by humanity or whatever beastly thing you believe in that you will not tell my secret to the anarchists
6462672 you must have bewitched me but i feel a furious curiosity about you yes i will swear not to tell the anarchists anything you tell me but look sharp for they will be here in a couple of minutes
6462673 i dont know how to tell you the truth more shortly than by saying that your expedient of dressing up as an aimless poet is not confined to you or your president we have known the dodge for some time at scotland yard
6462674 i am a police detective but i think i hear your friends coming
6462675 its really unfortunate theyre friends so what people do make mistakes in the past you move on this is a new century a new time he reflects back and hes been making a strong contribution to our community

6462709 i think people will see that im not afraid to have folks around me who complement my strengths and who are independent im not a believer in a government of yes men i think one of the failures of the early bush administration was being surrounded by people who were unwilling to deliver bad news or who were prone to simply feed the president information that confirmed his own preconceptions

6462711 right now the challenge for photovoltaics is to make the technology less expensive
6462712 therefore the objective is find new materials and novel device structures for cost effective photovoltaic devices
6462713 the beauty of organic photovoltaics and organic leds is low cost and flexibility
6462714 these devices can be fabricated by inexpensive solution based processing techniques similar to painting or printing
6462715 the ease of production brings costs down while the mechanical flexibility of the materials opens up a wide range of applications
6462716 the research at sdsu is focused on new materials with variable band gaps
6462717 the band gap determines how much solar energy the photovoltaic device can absorb and convert into electricity
6462718 were working on synthesizing novel polymers with variable band gaps including high medium and low band gap varieties to absorb the full spectrum of sunlight by this we can double the light harvesting or absorption
6462719 we are working to develop these new light emitting and efficient charge transporting materials to improve the light emitting efficiency of full color displays
6462720 despite media coverage of alcohol related problems at sporting events there has been surprisingly little published research addressing alcohol use sales or problems at professional sport stadiums in the u s
6462721 this is the first study that we know of that looked systematically at the likelihood of illegal alcohol sales at professional sport stadiums across a larger number of stadiums
6462722 alcohol problems at sports stadiums received considerable press attention in the early 1980s as there were several incidents involving violence in the stadiums and drinking driving incidents stemming from intoxicated fans leaving sporting events
6462723 as a result the national highway traffic safety administration developed a responsible beverage service rbs training program for alcohol servers in stadium venues
6462724 many sports stadiums are known to condone alcohol related rowdy behavior that can easily lead to violence as well as a likely location to begin drinking driving incidents
6462725 nearly one out of five youth who appeared under age 21 could purchase alcohol without age identification at the 16 professional hockey football basketball and baseball stadiums in the u s that we assessed
6462726 approximately three out of four fans who appeared obviously intoxicated could easily purchase alcohol at these professional sporting events what this indicates to me is that we have had some success in emphasizing the importance of not selling alcohol to underage people the likelihood of alcohol establishments selling alcohol to underage youth was 50 to 99 percent across communities during the early 1990s however we still need to get the likelihood of sales to underage youth even lower across all venues and we have significantly more work to do to address sales to obviously intoxicated patrons
6462727 a 74 percent violation rate is simply unacceptable and demonstrates that even basic steps to insure compliance with the law are not being taken second the study confirms what prevention specialists have long suspected that alcohol sales in the stands as opposed to the concessions create high risk for illegal sales
6462728 one reason may be that when alcohol is sold in the stands it may be more difficult for the servers to hear or to see the customer to assess their age and level of intoxication
6462729 the servers may feel pressure to make the sale quickly in the stands to get to all of the customers and to get out of the way of fans who are trying to watch the game giving the server less time to do the proper assessment also we have found that alcohol sales are less likely when managers are present the servers in the stands may feel that they are not being watched as closely by managers compared to the servers located in the booths
6462730 we have found here in california that banning alcohol at beaches has had very positive effects not only in terms of reducing alcohol related violence and rowdiness at the beaches but also for local businesses that initially opposed the bans
6462731 instead of reducing the number of beachgoers as was feared it actually increased use of the beaches and increased sales in nearby businesses with the reduction in intoxicated beachgoers people put off by the disruption started coming in greater numbers particularly families i believe the same phenomenon will occur at sports stadiums
6462732 illegal alcohol sales affect more people than just those who are served the alcohol
6462733 as youth and adults become more intoxicated they may cause disruptions get into arguments or injure other fans attending the games after leaving the events they may damage property surrounding the stadiums or get behind the wheel and crash into other fans or individuals in the community this really is a larger problem that needs to be addressed by every community that houses a professional sport stadium
6462734 catholics are listening carefully to what the candidates have to say but very few are following the dictates of the catholic bishops when it comes to politics
6462735 while catholic republicans and democrats and mccain and obama voters may disagree on national priorities majorities of all of these voters strongly agree that catholics are not obligated to heed the bishops recommendations
6462736 sixty nine percent of catholics do not feel obligated to vote against candidates who support abortion

6462750 the families who are struggling with what to do about this vaccine are focused on issues like safety
6462751 they want us to have more experience with it and have it used by more people
6462752 we tend to overrate the power of conservative forces in our society on the everyday lives of people for example roman catholics use contraception and have abortions at about the same rates as other women in this country

6462767 there is now incontrovertible evidence that marketing of tobacco and the depiction of smoking in the movies promote youth smoking and can cause young people to begin smoking
6462768 the role of the media in promoting and reducing tobacco use
6462769 the role of marketing in the success of the tobacco companies is conclusive
6462770 the reports recommendations offer the best approach to employ marketing techniques and the media to help prevent a further increase in youth smoking
6462771 this direct link between marketing and tobacco use is very powerful
6462772 anti tobacco ads before films and a comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising are two effective strategies found to curb effects of tobacco images on youth now we need to use marketing to steer youth and others away from tobacco

6462829 a central theme of our business at luna roasters is building community
6462830 whether it is a denver native or a guest making their first visit we look forward to bringing people together to celebrate the convention and our fine city over the only cup of coffee good enough to be called presidential
6462831 it really is such a boys club at the moment and its been that way for a while
6462832 on my way back home from a trip recently i picked up a couple of christian radio stations and there were two maybe three female artists in the mix
6462833 were in a cycle and its been a long one christian music is definitely not following in the footsteps of mainstream music with the massive success of artists like carrie underwood fergie and rhianna to name a few in the days of amy grant and sandi patty contemporary christian female artists were filling arenas today so many radio stations are programmed by research and the research often says listeners dont want to hear from female artists
6462834 radio programmers are targeting becky because they believe they will get most of the family listening if she is shes really the most important one to have on board
6462835 the challenge of the current research model is seeing that very few female voices end up translating well with becky the big joke is that if the artists name is becky then becky doesnt want to hear anyone named becky
6462836 theres no exact science to why this happens unfortunately but were hoping as technology continues to improve that well be able to better pinpoint what listeners want
6462837 but in lauras case her song tested well and has been embraced
6462838 this is definitely a hypothesis but i think it has something to do with human nature
6462839 people naturally like to hear things theyre used to hearing so when fewer females are being played on the radio which happens to be the case right now they sound less familiar during the testing process but when its a sound that isnt testing as well i think we have to be more patient and push a little harder as a label
6462840 weve definitely been in a season where worship music is sort of dominating airwaves
6462841 and it seems to me that people are used to seeing and hearing men lead worship and sing worship songs which could be why theres fewer female artists its not a conspiracy of course its just how it is
6462842 this may be just an educated guess but its possible than when people hear a song by a female it sounds so incredibly different that the song ends up testing lower
6462843 hopefully were starting to see that change and i think the more females we get on the radio the better were going to see them testing
6462844 i would love to see artists and labels take more risks
6462845 we shouldnt always go with the obvious or safe choice as a radio single instead go with the one that will compel the audience to drive to target and buy your cd ultimately i pray that labels will continue to seek out great female talent not only because the industry needs them but because the audience does the church does and my daughters need them too
6462846 were just in a down cycle right now and im optimistic that things will be on the upswing soon
6462847 to radios credit while they were slow to play mandisa she did end up having a 1 song another artist of ours britt nicole has just released her third single and theyve all gone top 10 when we make good records and sign good artists radio does play them
6462848 its our responsibility to develop these female artists i think radio is probably still the number one place where consumers hear new artists and new music
6462849 and i think there is a desire out there for more female artists to be heard i think back to the times when cindy morgan jaci velasquez and nicole c mullen were breaking there were some really memorable songs that stood the test of time and i think that can happen again
6462850 there was a time when females ruled the radio charts just a few years ago and it can definitely happen again and i think anyone at a label publishing company will say that no matter who the artist is he she can have success with the right song
6462851 i think that is the answer to the question of what it takes to be a big success on radio these days if you have a killer song that connects to the hearts of people then you should have success
6462852 but police put up many obstacles to make it difficult
6462853 the fact that there were so many undercover police following them just made them go with the action urgently
6462854 how honest are we if we tell the truth most of the time amp
6462855 if we dont go on and move its going to continue to deteriorate so were at a crucial point
6462856 i see him as the precursor to martin luther king
6462857 not only was he an organizer he was a humanitarian an entrepreneur he was an author he took care of the poor he spoke for the disenfranchised he was the person who was recognized and well respected in both communities african american and the white communities
6462858 the waltons are concerned they dont want to infuse money into this project and then were not able to maintain it and thats a legitimate concern
6462859 the older ladies would teach us how to usher and wear our gloves
6462860 also there was a locket which was gold with blue enamel and a pearl and it belonged to roberta if i knew who bought it i would want to buy it back its priceless to me because of its sentimental value

6462863 its set to be a sort of archive of interviews with different people in fashion designers photographers models editors etc and meant to teach young teen vogue readers about what it takes to break into the industry
6462864 at barneys i saw a terrific wool pencil skirt by mr jacobs with an elastic grosgrain waist just pull it on considering the name and the quality of the fit it seemed a good buy at 495

6462866 my best friends started calling me derogatory terms and started saying things to put me down like i was nothing
6462867 earlier this year belstaff showed its commitment to international charitable causes by releasing a range of free tibet jackets a cause that has been close to the brands heart since meeting the dalai lama in 2004
6462868 resurrection avant garde fashion an extensive collection of 20th century fashion previously held in private hands will be sold in london at the south kensington saleroom the auction includes items from designers from the 1960s to the 1990s who challenged cherished norms with new materials and innovative ways of cutting fabric
6462869 his name was william frederick hunter and she only saw him once
6462870 as we look back on it we see that there were just some serious failures in the management of risks
6462871 we have a nationwide network of data arbitrators who are pulling these from local county level records
6462872 traditionally the things that cause foreclosures are problems in the economy the loss of jobs or lower paying jobs limits the ability to pay the mortgage
6462873 this time around we are seeing that the economy is getting a bit worse
6462874 over speculation and greed on everyones part allowed the housing market to basically get out of touch with reality and market fundamentals of supply and demand
6462875 we expect the trend to increase toward the end of the year because there are problem loans that have not reset yet and people can not make payments
6462876 i am a dominant defensive player i control the line of scrimmage
6462877 the single parent mom of michael phelps had her kid swim because she was afraid for her 64
6462878 what youre seeing is not just a consolidation of seed companies its really a consolidation of the entire food chain
6462879 there should be no place for nanoparticles in health and beauty products or food
6462880 we are deeply concerned at the governments failure to follow scientific advice and regulate products there should be an immediate freeze on the commercial release of nanomaterials until there is a sound body of scientific research into all the health impacts as we saw with gm the government is ignoring the initial indications of risk and giving the benefit of the doubt to commercial interest rather than the protection of human health
6462881 work closely with other stakeholders in these breadbasket areas to rapidly improve food production food security and rural incomes each agency will deliver unique expertise towards achieving an environmentally and economically sustainable green revolution that will end the continents perennial food crisis
6462882 sharing its expertise in a way that gives them access to modern agricultural technology
6462883 land values are very very inexpensive compared to other agriculture based economies its microclimates are enticing allowing a range of different crops theres accessible labor and theres good logistics wide open roads good truck transport sea transport

6462886 here is the clear evidence the absolute proof that this is really good for us this will be beneficial
6462887 we do not want this we do not trust how this will play out for us
6462888 we are not so sure about this it needs to be studied more
6462889 i want to welcome all of you here to continue our study of bill c 33 a bill enabling the government to set up our mandate on biofuels i want to welcome to the table today roger samson executive director of resource efficient agricultural production canada or reap canada and from rothsay we have todd moser from the canadian vehicle manufacturers association we have mark nantais and from the canadian petroleum products institute we have gilles morel and gene carrignan welcome to the committee
6462890 we had excellent presentations from a range of people involved in the production of ethanol and biodiesel refiners were there people from oxfam were there and people were there representing the voices of the poor around the world
6462891 we have what is a competition between a hierarchy of values
6462892 i acknowledge the honourable senators superior experience in the field let me tell you one little story that we heard from a person who is working in the development field and who described one very appropriate use of biofuel technology
6462893 today the commission tells comcast to stop and to disclose to its subscribers how it is going to manage traffic on a going forward basis
6462894 we therefore take another important step to ensure that all consumers have unfettered access to the internet
6462895 although comcasts terms of use statement may have specified that its broadband internet access service was subject to speed and upstream and downstream rate limitations such vague terms are of no practical utility to the average customer
6462896 this order marks a major milestone in internet policy for years the fcc declared that it would take action against any internet service provider caught violating the online rights guaranteed by the agency today the commission has delivered on that promise
6462897 shall encourage the deployment on a reasonable and timely basis of advanced telecommunications capability to all americans
6462898 the practice of degrading consumer ability to share or access video content effectively results in the limiting of deployment of an advanced telecommunications capability
6462899 we noticed the old bars were going away and we wanted to keep the spirit of the old baltimore pubs
6462900 i didnt get enough support from my federation in ethiopia
6462901 my track club in turkey gave me all the support i needed so i decided to move to turkey the support was much better in istanbul i thought it would be easier to reach my goals in turkey
6462902 e come una droga per te bella ormai ho capito che senza di lui non puoi vivere e troppo tardi ma io sarei stato una scelta pi sana non una droga io sarei stato laria il sole

6462906 tourists especially may be unfamiliar with parts of the alternate route so its very important that road users exercise patience and drive safely
6462907 im not prepared to give any information on which way were going yet we havent determined that
6462908 by mid to late october we feel very comfortable well be in position to make a decision on which direction to take
6462909 happy for her glad to see she is recovering from her divorce and putting it all behind her shes a great actress positive energy again
6462910 30 seconds of valerie bertinelli is hardly bearable these days i shudder to imagine what 30 minutes would be like and god forbid she returns to those moronic tv movies because that would mean hours of her
6462911 we believe more information can only help consumers make informed decisions and help us to make changes
6462912 we have six percent recall and we are too lazy to test ourselves
6462913 preparati al crepuscolo della tua vita appena iniziata preparati a rinunciare a tutto
6462914 theyre separated for the moment but are working on it
6462915 theyve got issues that theyre trying to work out its not a divorce right now but theyre taking time apart
6462916 if the petermann glacier breaks up back to the upstream rift the loss would be as much as 60 square miles 160 square kilometers

6462918 anche io ne ero convinta sai eri come il sole il mio sole personale il rimedio migliore alle mie nuvole
6462919 this should be a pretty good year for leaf color change
6462920 although there was enough rainfall this spring to keep the trees healthy we are still in drought conditions in the western part of the state which surprisingly is good for fall color fortunately the summer temperatures have not been as consistently hot as we had last year so we should not experience the early leaf drop we had last fall it all adds up to a nice long progression of fall color
6462921 if the temperatures in september and october cooperate and cool down contributing to the breakdown of chlorophyll we should expect to see some brilliant fall colors this year
6462922 last year there was not much of a peak although we did see some brilliant color this year the trees should be on a more typical color schedule peaking in mid october in the mountains
6462923 and a sharp cooling of temperatures in september and october would really cause the colors to burst as this stimulates the production of anthocyanin or red pigments
6462924 we cannot keep on taking away children from a mother
6462925 my feeling would be that she gana would be going through very similar emotions to any mother
6462926 studies of the mental processes of other animals indicate that the conceptual level necessary for understanding death has not been achieved
6462927 my suspicion is that doubt about animal emotions is espoused not because it serves science but because it protects the emotional needs of the scientist

6462933 i love qxp 8 but hated the big green move tool so i changed it
6462934 weary of being cast as a stodgy oldster by apple inc s advertising
6462935 a friend of mine years ago had sent me the australian version and i thought it was amazing and i loved it and then i heard that nbc was adapting it and they brought michelle nader aboard and i loved the script and i really love doing characters i prefer that to playing close to myself it just feels more fun to me and freeing and yeah i was just excited about it i could really relate to the dysfunctional family i like that my character kath is positive strong shes spent her whole life raising her daughter and now shes got her out of the house and she wants to move on she wants to focus on herself and her dating life and her figure and her diet and shes ready to go for it but she keeps getting sucked back into the drama with her daughter so on that level i thought it was very relatable and i love doing characters

6462939 i did a little research on small business loans but i didnt think id be a good candidate first my business was a startup and second i didnt have any collateral
6462940 dont stop at the first no or negative reaction and dont immediately go to credit card financing
6462941 its worth the time and effort to search out a lender in your community that has a micro loan business program
6462942 to find a lender look at some of the nontraditional micro enterprise development organizations
6462943 the association for enterprise opportunity aeo is the main nationwide micro loan support group you can search their website for aeo members listed by state many of these organizations offer business training too
6462944 i didnt know there were so many doors open to me when i was starting out
6462945 i felt like i was a man alone in the process
6462946 we get a lot of inquiries but its the serious people who write the business plans
6462947 the most important parts of the plan are the financial projections if the owner is already in business they also need to include tax returns and personal financial statements in addition to having a business plan the owners credit needs to be reasonable and they need to have at least 5 to 10 of the borrowed amount in cash as borrower equity they also need some type of collateral for the loan
6462948 a fanatic is one who cant change his mind and wont change the subject
6462949 i think this would be a pretty good one to pursue because zango is profiting directly from the infringement
6462950 receive a financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity
6462951 affiliate relationships are not by themselves going to disqualify a service provider from the dmca safe harbors disqualification requires both financial benefit and the right and ability to control the infringement
6462952 we believe that this will establish the psp as a viable communication device
6462953 i have seen this before follow me and i can show you the right road to travel
6462954 look our competitor is struggling financially i dont want you to end up without long term support
6462955 in the real origin stories of sherlock holmes hes kind of a bad ass and a bare knuckle boxer and studies the rare art of baritsu fictional martial art created by doyle for the final holmes story 1901s the adventure of the empty house if you look baritsu up they cant even really tell you what it is so it gives us a lot of leeway
6462956 like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of
6462957 we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
6462958 now mr hoffman if you say one word to me for what i have to say theres a record of what i have to say you will be held in contempt of court and i will sentence you up to six months in jail and i will hold you in direct criminal contempt of court
6462959 now you need to hear what i have to say
6462960 you have shown and continue to show no respect for anyone in the legal system for any individual who is part of the legal system and you actually dont show any respect for any of us whether you have it or not
6462961 the fact of the matter is i dont know what happened to you mr
6462962 so i dont quite understand what has happened to your and i dont even want to say respect because you know what
6462963 so the fact of the matter is the record will reflect that when you are in my courtroom you will show nothing im not going to ask for respect im going to show tolerance for what is expected of you and having said that thats whats expected
6462964 now john and jim courthouse security officer john pakenham and bailiff jim mazak mr
6462965 mr hoffman what you do outside of the courtroom and my office is up to you because you have the right to do that and i dont want any response what you do with mr pennington is up to you now mr pennington
6462966 absolutely not because i made it very clear that theyre hearsay
6462967 then why are you addressing them without me getting the chance to address these allegations
6462968 because i want it very clear what i expect in my courtroom im not asking you to respond because as far as im concerned theres no consequences to what i said there cant be its hearsay i believe in someone being presumed innocent and that is what i stand for
6462969 i dont want a response because the response isnt necessary i did this now mr hoffman i told you i did this to make certain we all understand the rules in this courtroom period
6462970 now aged 33 mr wylie said his mother had encouraged him to throw bottles into the sea as a child something which he continues to do with his own children
6462971 when we were audited earlier this year i didnt have a receipt as backup for this fire tax deposit
6462972 kay had discussed this situation with me a couple of times but weve been very busy and it never got taken care of
6462973 the fire department needs to set up a committee and we have to set up a meeting with that committee
6462974 the point is shirley that the village cannot owe this money to the fire department a lot of fire departments and volunteer fire departments dont know that this money is owed to them but the law says that we have to pay our fire department this money
6462975 when this money comes in to us it should be automatically sent to the fire department
6462976 is that we owe them this money and they know it
6462977 the law says that a firefighter can be on a board and vote on these issues
6462978 well if our lawyer was here he would tell you that mr ceja should be able to vote on this issue as a trustee
6462979 everyone wants to get on a bike in the velodrome where the olympics stars trained
6462980 were happy to claim him as a true yorkshire hero definitely
6462981 until zacs success im sure most people connected tewkesbury with flooding its not an area famous for much else other than the battle in the wars of the roses zacs put that right
6462982 its absolutely fantastic news that mark hunter who grew up and trained in havering has won an olympic gold medal
6462983 cardiff is a proud sporting city and sport pulls this city together everyone here knew geraint could do it his selfless nature for his team epitomises what cardiff is about

6462990 tv will fundamentally change how we talk about imagine and experience the internet
6462991 no longer just a passive experience unless the viewer wants it that way intel and yahoo are proposing a way where the tv and internet are as interactive and seamless as possible
6462992 export sales are now exceeding u s construction sales and we believe they will be a strong contributor to our future profitability
6462993 chief among the reasons children drop out of school is because they are failing their course work

6463000 if id have known i probably would have gone and gotten degrees in psychology
6463001 i just know that god has not told me that
6463002 i know of no one who is more dedicated to their work than my sister june
6463003 i thought where in the world can she be then i remembered there was this lady helping bus the tables who looked like she had been down one of the toughest roads of life
6463004 i went back into the room where wed had this banquet and there was june talking to this lady about the lord
6463005 she is the consummate expression of the virtuous christian woman
6463006 she holds the spiritual truth communicates the spiritual truth and lives out the spiritual truth
6463007 he was the laughingstock of the people but he was faithful and i just want to be faithful to do even if it doesnt always make sense what god is leading me to do
6463008 people would drive by mount vernon on white rock lake and think everything had to be so charmed
6463009 she would stand up for herself and she would stand up for different people in the family
6463010 i wasnt even a christian then but i prayed my mother would have a friend

6463014 before i formed you in the womb i knew you
6463015 if i were a gay person who believed most of the things she said i would listen to that radio station and feel devastated thinking theres something wrong with me
6463016 she is totally in charge of her ministry she is not submitting to any man
6463017 for a long time hope in the night has been i believe the hallmark of junes day the centerpiece
6463018 tech data performed well in the second quarter considering the challenges of the global macroeconomic environment

6463178 went through some things that none of us could imagine
6463179 i guess if youre only making 3 million a year then youre middle class
6463180 then there was another interview the same day somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have
6463181 im not sure ill have to check with my staff so they asked his staff and he said at least four at least four
6463182 i guess if you think that being rich means you gotta make five million dollars and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6463183 but if youre like me and youve got one house
6463184 or youre like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so that they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6463185 by the way the answer is john mccain has seven homes
6463186 so theres just a fundamental gap of understanding between john mccains world and what people are going through every single day here in america and you dont have to be a nobel prize laureate economist you just have to have a little bit of a sense of what ordinary people are going through to understand that we cant afford eight more years or four more years or one more year of the same failed economic policies that george bush has put in place
6463187 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans the reality is that barack obamas plans to raise taxes and opposition to producing more energy here at home as gas prices skyrocket show hes completely out of touch with the concerns of average americans

6463281 fpl well represents a model of true integration in health benefit design
6463282 the approach is employee centered not program centered all five elements are managed as an integrated whole and it is the clearest way an employer can communicate that its employees are an asset
6463283 the approach is to take care of the complete individual

6463298 it seems as though a day cannot pass without the media touting the dismal state of our national housing market what is not discussed is that the housing market as are most markets is cyclical in nature in the lake tahoe real estate market we have seen downward trends before and we will see them again but how often have we heard the words i could have should have
6463299 it is not known how long the housing market will remain in todays current state what is known is that it has been quite some time since we have seen such levels of affordability combined with low interest rates in the south lake tahoe area

6463303 many unstable countries change their currency every few years to help control runaway inflation and often to curb corruption the african country ghana just looped off three zeros in their currency this was done more to help control the rampant illegal diamond business in that country than to help inflation there was an estimated 25 percent of the currency in criminal hands outside the countrys banking system the turn in period was short only 60 days and the customer turning in old currency had to have an existing bank account
6463304 when the ruble became an international currency the first thing the russian government did was print new currency and give only 90 days to turn in old currency to convert to new currency
6463305 they also put a temporary freeze on new bank accounts being opened during the turn in period this left all the tens of millions of rubles outside russia as worthless a successful investor made several thousand percent in just the first year
6463306 today investors are interested in the chinese yuan the vietnamese dong and the iraqi dinar to name a few
6463307 the lesson learned is to make sure you comply with the issuing countries laws on their currency and business
6463308 to safely invest in any of these countries you need a state approved business license
6463309 because we do licensing in iraq we do make it easier to do business there where licensing has gone up dramatically for foreign companies often times it is better to wait until the currency actually makes it to the international market before investing or doing business

6463479 gli amori vanno via ma i sogni i sogni no
6463480 i basically only ate kosher for two years of my life and i remember the sabbath meals and pesach seders
6463481 the creditors were planning to sell the plant machinery for five cents on the dollar to recoup their investment
6463482 we also need a specialized niche market for this cheese because there is no way that a small plant in upstate new york would be able to compete with such industry giants as kraft cheese
6463483 chalav yisrael cheese prices are quite high as is with a 108 slice block of cheese reaching some 19 per block
6463484 prices are higher than they have ever been and the market could not have tolerated the closing of one of the three major chalav yisrael suppliers
6463485 the price per pound of wholesale chalav yisrael cheese for pizza is about 3 55 now although we do not use ahava it has always been about 0 50 less per pound than their competition
6463486 we utilized what is known as a tax lien forfeiture the company owed approximately 60 000 in taxes i merely filed the papers on behalf of the city
6463487 the essential issue at play here is that a city any city can move much faster than a bank when it comes to filing papers and foreclosing
6463488 it is evident from here that municipal tax liens always supersede private liens of any sort and can be acted upon with extreme swiftness if need be that is why in 99 percent of cases lenders escrow for real estate taxes to avoid the precise scenario that occurred here
6463489 im thinking wow disc replacement is the best thing since sliced bread
6463490 having that surgery was the worst decision of my life
6463491 most physicians in the united states have financial relationships with industry ranging from the acceptance of meals to the receipt of large sums of money for consulting speaking or conducting research
6463492 consumers should absolutely know where their doctor is coming from
6463493 doctors think they wont be influenced by these financial relationships but the research shows that they are
6463494 lets say your investment counselor went on a trip to aruba paid for by a certain company
6463495 then he comes home and recommends you invest in that company wouldnt you be concerned
6463496 look around for hints that your doctor sees a lot of drug reps
6463497 and if you see an extremely attractive impeccably dressed polite person with a briefcase in the waiting room watch out thats most likely a drug rep
6463498 ask the doctor whats the scientific evidence for prescribing that particular drug over another one they must have a scientific reason especially if its a high price brand name drug instead of a generic
6463499 there are circumstances where you want to take this extra step and there are other times where you really dont want to bother
6463500 the first priority of physicians is the health and well being of our patients
6463501 it is with some sadness that we make this announcement but also with the desire for certainty that will allow us to move the team and organization forward in the most positive way possible
6463502 i am looking forward to seeing brett favre in a new york jets uniform
6463503 he represents a significant addition to this franchise and reflects our commitment to putting the best possible team on the field
6463504 we just felt like this was an opportunity to go get somebody of bretts stature and what hes accomplished
6463505 we felt it was in the best interest of the team and when the opportunity presented itself we felt it was the right move for us to make and we went ahead and did it
6463506 we had discussions with him and his agent bus cook
6463507 and were going into this and were going to take this one year at a time and were excited to have brett on the team this year
6463508 i have all the respect in the world for chad as a person as a player weve accomplished a lot of good things with chad he gave his heart and soul to this organization for a long long time i really appreciate everything hes done
6463509 hopefully we can get something resolved ive been saying that for quite a while now i dont want to say were running out of time but i need to get into a camp somewhere
6463510 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want
6463511 he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past things that have happened i have to keep the train moving
6463512 the players want resolution they want what everybody wants to come out here every day and talk about somebody that is not here and then shows up its gone on too long and understandably so they want to play football

6463532 consumers need to learn about the steps they can take to upgrade to digital before its too late
6463533 as broadcasters our goal is to ensure that no american loses television reception in february 2009 due to a lack of information about the transition to digital the dtv road show provides a fun and engaging event for families to get the information they need to prepare for the switch to digital television
6463534 i understand senator mccain was asked yesterday this question how many houses do you own and he couldnt answer that question
6463535 he couldnt count high enough to know how many houses he owns
6463536 until we receive further clarity on whether or not there is a direct link between maple leaf foods and the ontario death and any resulting legal action we are moving to a hold recommendation
6463537 acho que minha mulher muito criativa considero isso revigorante e interessante
6463538 s vezes temos conversas profundas outras mais superficiais ocorre o mesmo nas rela es de todo o mundo
6463539 pensando no passado acho que n o t nhamos de ser t o r spidos e dizer estamos nos separando realmente
6463540 dev amos s ter nos acalmado um pouco e passado um tempo fora para ser honesto
6463541 mas obviamente t nhamos uma vontade profunda de voltar a fazer isso ou ent o n o teria acontecido s espero que n o nos separemos agora por que a fica um pouco bobo n o fica
6463542 vai ser ou no fim deste ano ou no come o do outro
6463543 n o acho que termos voltado significa que temos de fazer um disco todo ano
6463544 vamos fazer as coisas do nosso jeito e do nosso ritmo mas definitivamente todos queremos seguir este caminho algo que significa muito para n s um choque fazer isso de novo mas um bom choque realmente
6463545 weve always known that people were being mis sold ppi but we were still amazed to discover the scale of it it appears that salespeople are chasing their commissions their bosses are chasing profits wheres the sense of responsibility to the customer
6463546 if you have a loan and think you might have been mis sold ppi nows the time to fight back compensation could be just a letter away

6463555 i am pleased to have the opportunity to highlight the rapidly emerging topic of geospatial data convergence and the importance of geospatial data quality with the support of two key organisations in the australian geospatial market this is an exciting time for 1spatial as we continue to grow in australia
6463556 im very thankful that tony resch and the front office was able to work me back into the lineup
6463557 theres a reason tony is the mll coach of the year he did a great job managing it all and being lenient with certain players in certain situations the lines of communication were always open they never really shut the door on me
6463558 the only way to make it work is to find recruiting events in the cities where were going to play
6463559 thats what i have done the past few years the reason it was so tough this year was because we didnt have a home field we played in non traditional places which was great for the sport but its hard to find recruiting events in dallas or north carolina or st louis
6463560 it was fairly easy to stay in shape during recruiting
6463561 you just have to find time to do it there are other coaches out there who want to work out i found a basketball game here and there in between sessions at a recruiting camp and you can bring a bucket of balls with you and take some shots you can do all the things to stay in lacrosse shape

6463567 saya tentu mengapresiasi semua saran terkait komunikasi yang bisa mendekatkan kepada masyarakat termasuk membuat blog bergabung dalam komunitas blogger
6463568 dengan blog demokrasi kita harapkan lebih baik juga ada peningkatan kualitas dalam segala hal
6463569 saya bergabung dalam blogging jangan diartikan secara sempit sebagai upaya politik dan perebutan kekuasaan ini merupakan perluasan komunikasi publik yang selama ini saya bangun baik melalui internet website dan media media massa lainnya maupun melalui media lain seperti ceramah tablig akbar dan seminar seminar
6463570 karena itu terimalah kehadiran saya ini di blog sebagai bentuk komunikasi jangan dipersempit sebagai upaya politik menjelang pemilu
6463571 oh you hmm those pants are ugly get me coffee
6463572 when my kids learned i got the job as head of the conservancy they were just as excited as i was
6463573 its a fast paced competitive environment that lived up to all my expectations
6463574 i was considering shifting gears into the public sector education or the environment
6463575 and was thinking that i would leave the firm to do so
6463576 started thinking that opportunities for firms like goldman sachs to enact positive environmental change were only increasing
6463577 and the more we looked into it the more we saw that we could pursue good environmental outcomes that were simultaneously good for business
6463578 made me realize how corporate america can really help to enact lasting environmental change
6463579 hes an asset whether hes in the financial community or the ngo community
6463580 mark is very smart very energetic very thoughtful hes a terrific entrepreneur in thinking about how to use markets to solve environmental problems
6463581 when we initially released our environmental policy framework the main goal was to get each of our businesses thinking about being more sustainable
6463582 while theres certainly still a lot of work to be done all of our investors and corporate partners have thus far really been on board
6463583 the very size scale track record and fundraising success of the organization made me realize that the organization is well positioned to achieve real conservation successes
6463584 he strikes me as a person that as problems come up for the organization will just naturally seek out advice
6463585 that tnc has to be really outstanding in going forward
6463586 there is a lot of overlap in the way the conservancy does business and the way wall street does business
6463587 depois de atenas foi complicado para levantar a cabe a de muita gente inclusive a minha fiquei em um momento muito d bil de for a foi muito complicado
6463588 eu vivi muito intensamente esse per odo p s atenas sofrendo os problemas de ter perdido de ter falhado naquele momento eu era t cnico do finasa e via nos gin sios os cartazes com o placar de 24 a 19 o brasil liderava por esse marcador o quarto set contra a r ssia em atenas mas n o conseguiu fechar a semifinal dif cil um treinador perder um jogo desses
6463589 o problema era reestruturar o grupo refazer treinar as jogadoras ter um horizonte e este grupo agora foi sendo trabalhado t nhamos uma meta de fazer 150 jogos internacionais acabamos realizando 138 fomos formando o grupo devagar
6463590 o n utico passa por um momento delicado e ele n o pode ficar rf o do seu torcedor ele est certo e deve continuar a cobrar mas o grupo de jogadores que n s temos se derem uma carga maior vai quebrar o grupo estava abalado mas um momento de apoio n o houve m vontade ou falta de disposi o
6463591 est come ando o segundo turno agora s vou poder dar uma defini o sobre isso quando estiver com 85 do grupo disposi o e bem treinado vou dar um exemplo que a falta de planejamento e a necessidade da vit ria o reinaldo chegou fez dois treinos f sicos e foi para o jogo claro que n o vai render
6463592 its not as if i had photographed olympia now it was a very old image and it had been seen by a lot of people
6463593 when i asked olympia if we could use the image on the cover she said sure mum i said it could appear on the newsstands and be bought by people she said thats fine it was taken when i was a baby she sees that body as very different to the body she has now
6463594 away from our familiar urban environment papapetrous children act out roles that take us into a familiar but forgotten past
6463595 in doing so papapetrou induces what she calls the wonderfully heterogenous dimensions of childhood where the fear and danger mix with the angelic
6463596 lost in a beguiling narrative the young characters in papapetrous fabrications wander without a story escaping the inevitable fate of all tales an ending
6463597 youre only a child for such a short time but youre an adult for the rest of your life
6463598 a lot of people look back on their childhood very nostalgically they loved it or they hated it childhood is such a formative period and i think im privileged to have been able to photograph children because once theyre 15 or 16 its over
6463599 i didnt start photographing her for my work until she was much older but i was aware from a young age she had this incredible presence before the camera
6463600 as a subject matter olympia is totally fascinating i have photographed solomon but olympia has this relationship with the camera i think its like why some film directors work with the same actors over and over again
6463601 i wanted to make pictures about my childhood so i could show my children what i did and how i discovered a world of freedom
6463602 i dont think that world exists for children any more
6463603 at the beach it was picking up shells and listening to the water we believed it was the mermaids singing to us
6463604 and wed just sort of walk around paddocks and vacant lots and play with ropes wed tie each other up we tested ourselves we would wander for hours and sometimes wed become lost but we always found our way home
6463605 it would be all of us other neighbourhood children and my brother and sister playing as a group
6463606 we would just wheel my brother around in a pram can you imagine a six year old today wandering around with a newborn baby thats what we did and wed do it for hours we had such fun
6463607 i really had no time to think about my work other than simply trying to manage my life and my children and my family
6463608 i thought well we all know where we stand now
6463609 if bill hensons images had been given an r rating or if charges had been laid against him i would have thought well maybe the ground has shifted the territory has changed
6463610 what i failed to realise was that even though the matter had been settled in bill hensons favour that actually there had been a cultural shift in this country
6463611 a little child cannot answer for themselves about whether they wish to be depicted in this way
6463612 she was just upset by the way people were making a big deal out of it
6463613 most of all she was angry that part of her body had been blocked and that the pm said disparaging things about the work she felt very let down by the politicians and the media who she felt had misunderstood the work
6463614 at no point did she feel a victim she had been consulted the whole way through the process she enjoyed being photographed and i think is proud of the work weve done together she wanted to defend it
6463615 everything that i believe in was attacked my art was attacked my role as a mother was attacked as if id abrogated my maternal duties by allowing the work to be published then allowing olympia to appear before the media
6463616 and olympia is not ashamed of this picture she sees this as a part of her life thats gone she will never be like this again its her baby body
6463617 ive journeyed from domestic space to play space to imaginative space to the real world and what im finding now is that i want to go back to where i started from
6463618 it may sound strange but i think ive done a complete circle with my work i want to go back to where i started exploring that intimacy you find in the space that is the home im ready for that
6463619 we were attracted by legacy of producing top quality products
6463620 looming uncertainty over the shape of the global carbon markets after 2012 and the effects of the credit crunch are contributing to a slowing down of new capital joining the carbon market
6463621 in most other asset classes 63 percent growth in assets under management would be a pretty good story but the 100 percent plus growth in carbon markets between 2006 and 2007 has outpaced growth in carbon funds
6463622 the entry of the u s into the global carbon markets will be game changing and while a successor to kyoto is going to be tough to negotiate pressure is building on the international community to act decisively on climate change
6463623 we need to be realistic about what we can and cant do with hydrogen right now
6463624 in addition to some of the more buck rogers things that might happen in the future we need to study some of the things we can do in the short term
6463625 hydrogen fuel cell analysis lessons learned from stationary power generation
6463626 the ashkin family and executive management of darby dental supply believe that no employees family should become financially strapped when their key source of income is deployed to preserve the freedom we often take for granted weve noticed that our national guard and reserve members who return to work after deployment are more focused and less stressed if they dont come home to unpaid bills uncertain job security or worse
6463627 knowing that my family was able to live the lifestyle they are accustomed to was very important to me
6463628 the full pay deployment program is one of the best benefits a company can offer in these troubled times
6463629 we wish our employees were not deployed and we pray for their safe return
6463630 until then well do our best to ensure their families are provided for its the least we can do
6463631 hey get a load of me being a funny guy
6463632 oh my god people might start writing sequels to hamlet for real
6463633 la situation du secteur financier et la hausse des prix du p trole

6463637 i find fox hunting appalling and the people who hunt are appalling themselves
6463638 when you study hamlet it affects you you cannot help but be affected by the philosophy the ethics of the piece
6463639 so actors are suckers for animals the greatest actors understand that they are part of our lives part of the fabric of the world we have no right to abuse them merely because we have a little gene of intelligence that allows us to have guns fishing rods
6463640 the great actors when you look at them have the faces of saints their faces are almost etched with a tremendous amount of awareness you look at the face of paul scofield the way he acts his voice his manner he is like a grand priest a prophet gielgud the face of that man his compassion and sensibility ian mckellen his great grooved face
6463641 the printed word only conveys the voice of the reader but when youre acting it out your voice contains maybe dozens of variations of sound according to the mans attitude and his behaviour
6463642 if you think its too hard then you must stop and do things you can do i can get up on the stage and simulate a young man its the only way i can do it otherwise it would look absurd ridiculous this old man being a young football lout but i act it out and when im doing it i really do feel that young
6463643 to be able to act you have to be able to retard maturity
6463644 you have to be able to keep the child alive its not to become childish but to be able to tap into it playfulness cheekiness mischievousness and the ability to make a fool of yourself without facing the embarrassment that would normally come with age
6463645 the main expression of the middle class is vocal its language text the printed word
6463646 and usually it does if it didnt i couldnt really do it it has to excite you to an extraordinary level the more excited you are the further you may go the more youll explore until you go to such lengths as to have you arrested
6463647 sewaktu saya jadi pensyarah di luar negara ada juga orang yang tawarkan saya jawatan yang tinggi tapi itu saya tak mahu
6463648 pelabur pelabur luar pun ada jumpa saya mereka cakap anwar kamu pimpinlah negara ini kerana kalau kamu pimpin ekonomi negara ini akan kami naikkan dalam masa tiga bulan itu kamu tak perlu risau
6463649 thank you were so excited obviously weve been through it before its all good its great im really excited
6463650 oh im not pregnant i just had a lot of carbs for breakfast its just what do they call it a breakfast pouch bunch
6463651 it always makes me laugh when people say is she isnt she its like eventually you will know so just chill out for a minute
6463652 im not going to say im never going to do drugs again i just know im not a good person on drugs
6463653 it was the hardest thing for me when i realised i was pregnant and realised i wanted to have the baby i made a huge decision to make my life more stable
6463654 she wants cydney and cynthia to be friends jodie realises that if cydney perceives them to be one big happy family shed never sue for half her assets
6463655 i believe in hard work and in staying true to family and friends i believe in giving i was lucky but i always tried to do right by my team
6463656 i believe passion discipline courage and honor are the fundamentals of life i too have been lucky but win or lose ive always tried to be a true sportsman both on and off the playing fields
6463657 this psychiatry s t apparently what youre feeling is not what youre feeling and what youre not feeling is your real agenda
6463658 these people are not like pro fans this is their school its their pride and joy it aint like dolphin stadium i can tell you that
6463659 it takes an endless amount of history to make even a little tradition
6463660 ik ken een groot gedeelte van het elftal nog onder andere urby emanuelson en kenneth vermeer het is mooi dat ik terug ben ik verwacht drie mooie jaren hier met goed voetbal
6463661 ik ga voor een plaats op het middenveld voor de verdediging dan wel met de punt naar voren
6463662 ik ben heel blij dat ik terug ben psv voelt als thuis
6463663 ik voel me een speelbal in de handen van feyenoord
6463664 tyson has rendered himself academically ineligible and will no longer be part of the mens basketball program
6463665 we notified them on monday that our situation had forced us to down tools but we are yet to get a response from them
6463666 from time to time we review their salaries but at times we cannot cope up with the ever escalating cost of living
6463667 our demands are very reasonable we just want to be paid a decent salary
6463668 i wish these doctors would just continue working while the government look at their concerns
6463669 she has a running tummy i wonder if she will get a prescription
6463670 as animals are considered objects in china there is little or no awareness for the suffering of these sentient beings
6463671 the cruelty found was beyond our expectations and it was hard to document without interfering
6463672 reminds them of the ivy league whiz kids theyve dealt with at work during the latest downsizing
6463673 olbermanns popularity and evolving image as an idealogue sic has led nbc news to stretch traditional notions of journalistic objectivity
6463674 fox has never done that perhaps mindful of the immediate controversy that would result
6463675 this underscores the question of whether msnbc is taking a foolish risk in over committing itself to a single point of view
6463676 has proved herself to be a savvy commentator with quick smart takes on the news of the day
6463677 refusing to acknowledge anything but spite paranoia and conspiracy theory when it comes to the other side
6463678 refusing to acknowledge anything but spite paranoia and conspiracy theory when it comes to the other side
6463679 its a vehicle to get you somewhere you have never been
6463680 at that point i said hold on now its time for a change
6463681 your coming your going i find out how youre doing what youre doing where youre doing it at if you need some help then we sit down and deal with the issue and deal with the whole family
6463682 i tell them that youre worth more than you think you are
6463683 this place used to be called chocolate city he said
6463684 there used to be a whole lot of unity in this city there was a lot of drugs but there was also a lot of unity people spoke to each other that feeling is gone
6463685 like anything else change is coming nothing remains the same but i think a whole lot of our people sold out theyve been trying to get this building for four or five years but im not going to sell
6463686 this house is going to stay as long as i stay i hope that whoever i relinquish it to will take it over and run it how its supposed to run were all in it together blacks whites puerto ricans asians weve got all of em and we all get along its all about group communication
6463687 it was with profound shock and sorrow that i learned of the untimely death of our dear brother and colleague his excellency levy mwanawasa

6463694 i love her to death but having her still under my roof cramps my sex life now sasha
6463695 i was spying on my guys neighbors who were skinny dipping in their pool when he came into the room and caught me
6463696 i signed the model release but the only reason i posed is that my boyfriend shagged me silly three times in two hours wi
6463697 we slept together the night we met and spent the next 24 hou

6463723 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans barack obamas plans to raise taxes and opposition to producing more energy here at home as gas prices skyrocket show hes completely out of touch with the concerns of average americans
6463724 somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have and he said im not sure ill have to check with my staff true quote im not sure ill have to check with my staff so they asked his staff and he said at least four at least four
6463725 if youre like me and youve got one house or you were like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so that they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective by the way the answer is john mccain has seven homes so theres just a fundamental gap of understanding between john mccains world and what people are going through every single day here in america

6463759 i was watching tv and i saw a triathlon and i said i think i could do that
6463760 i was supposed to be meeting this guy out here at midnight but he never showed up
6463761 what if he wanted to kidnap us or something like that
6463762 i have no problem with him doing a show i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not making gestures like the one he made in the 100 meters

6463764 the deal is not done i dont want to eulogise about a player who has not signed in case it doesnt happen
6463765 but it is no secret we admire the player and wed like to tie something up
6463766 weve watched him for a while and he has got the technical ability to help our squad
6463767 its hard on players when they spend a lot of time getting fit in the summer and then pick up injuries
6463768 see this is where he sleeps in the summer he sleeps this side but in winter he moves to the other mattress we have to manage with just these two coolers so he moves to be more comfortable
6463769 with this medal we hope our needs are better looked after than before here there are 20 people to a room with two people to a bed not all rooms have coolers like ours and we have to share the space with rats and other animals here theres room for everybody
6463770 this is how weve been living we have to make do with what we have its very tough but what choice do we have
6463771 perhaps now that sushil had got a medal more money will come into the sport we have brought it to the attention of the authorities many times but it hasnt made a difference so we carry on
6463772 this is him with his 2005 arjuna award and heres another during the 1998 asian cadet junior meet where he won gold now he has an olympic medal
6463773 we are all very proud of what he has achieved and we cant wait to meet him at the airport
6463774 sushil also had the same difficulties but he had said hell win a medal and he did here at the stadium there are wrestlers from all over the country who are living in these conditions and i hope they are all inspired by what he has done wrestlers dont get jobs so many are unwilling to take it up seriously but now things will be different
6463775 callous attitude of the sports authority of india sai administration could seriously hamper indias medal prospects
6463776 right from filling water coolers to sweating it out in wrestling halls with not even air cooling facilities it was tough for them
6463777 i have seen with my eyes how the wrestling staff practised in the summer heat but still they managed to get a medal
6463778 the ground should be much better for her at newmarket than it would have been at york so it has worked out well for her
6463779 she has been in good form so hopefully she can get her head in front on friday
6463780 michita has been in good form since royal ascot and the ground should be ideal for her at newmarket
6463781 dar re mi handles most ground and probably would have been fine at york as she won on soft ground at deauville last time
6463782 she has come out of the race in good shape but obviously i think passage of time and lush lushes set the standard on form
6463783 i have spoken to henry cecil and he is very happy with how passage has been since goodwood
6463784 he has done a great job with her as she took an awful long time to come to herself this year
6463785 there was a muddling pace at goodwood which probably didnt suit her and she was only beaten two heads in the end
6463786 she gets the mile and a half well so everything looks to be in her favour
6463787 it surprised me in fact i think it has come as a surprise to everyone
6463788 it is not often a player leaves one big club to go to another like arsenal or liverpool it does not tend to happen
6463789 but mikael did not play much last year and i think he just wanted to go somewhere where he would so in that sense i am happy for him
6463790 he has been here a long time and he still deserves to play at the highest level
6463791 mikael has given so much to this club i am just surprised he is going to arsenal but he has made the choice
6463792 neither of us started well and we used to say we wanted to leave we can laugh about it now because we have both reached 100 games

6463795 na het optreden nodigde joel mary kate uit om een kijkje te nemen in de tourbus hij toonde haar fotos van zijn dochtertje harlow joel is er niet de kerel naar om te liegen tegen nicole dus de volgende dag vertelde hij dat aan de telefoon tegen nicole toen ging ze pas echt uit haar dak joel dacht nog dat hij zijn eerlijkheid zou respecteren maar dat draaide even anders uit nicole die geen oren had naar het argument dat joel en mary kate slechts goede vrienden zijn voelde zich gekwetst joel heeft het gesprek dan maar be indigd
6463796 dit is natuurlijk een supergrote ontlading spijtig dat het nu al niet binnen is ik was superzenuwachtig bij het starten ben ik door mijn knie gezakt ik was me aan het focussen op mijn lijntje en toen ik vertrok zakte ik door mijn knie en in plaats van mij langzaam op te richten liep ik direct helemaal recht ik dacht dat het gedaan was maar heb dan toch alles gegeven maar toen ik de stok doorgaf aan elodie heb ik twee keer moeten steken bijna tegen het einde van de zone voor de rest verliep alles bij iedereen perfect en ik denk dat we heel dicht bij ons belgisch record van 42 75 zullen zitten in de finale zonder die foutjes van mijn voetblessure heb ik niets gevoeld
6463797 deze tijd is uitstekend zeker in deze omstandigheden het was een beetje glad en het was ook delicater om de stok door te geven we mogen onszelf nu geen druk opleggen en we moeten goed rusten als die twee foutjes met hanna in de finale niet gebeuren dan mogen we hopen
6463798 we zijn echt opgelucht want het is pas de tweede keer dat we met dit team lopen dit jaar en de verenigde staten hebben nog maar eens getoond dat er vanalles kan gebeuren maar zo zie je maar dat onze trainingen op de wissels en de timing lonen we zitten nu met hetzelfde gevoel als in osaka en gaan onszelf niet zot laten maken we zijn waarschijnlijk het enige team dat zichzelf niet te serieus neemt
6463799 vanaf het moment dat je een tijd onder de 43 seconden loopt is het heel scherp en kim zei dat ze heel ontspannen heeft gelopen dus er kan waarschijnlijk nog wat van af dat we de derde tijd hebben van alle finalisten liever een derde tijd dan een zevende tijd natuurlijk de meisjes weten sinds het wk in osaka wat het is en ze moeten nu gewoon rustig blijven ze hebben ook vertrouwen en dat is een enorm voordeel kim was de afgelopen dagen alsof er niets aan de hand was eens bij de groep was de groep weer 100 compleet zij geniet echt van de aflossing ze besefte dat ze de keuze moest maken en door de goede prestatie vanavond is ze nu blij dat ze de juiste keuze heeft gemaakt

6463868 large companies are putting together server farms of tens of thousands of computers even approaching 100 thousand and the big challenge is to interconnect all these computers so that they can talk to each other as quickly as possible without incurring significant costs
6463869 we are proposing a new topology for ethernet data center connectivity
6463870 our work addresses the problem of data center network connectivity in a world where consolidation is increasingly taking place in data centers
6463871 the history of computing and technology has an innumerable set of examples where commodity parts take over the functionality of more specialized pieces of equipment
6463872 but that commoditization hasnt taken place on the communications side so we do have these specialized components still living in the network infrastructure that incur significant costs and complexity
6463873 the other issue is that people are treating the data center as a mini internet
6463874 thats fine but they are then forced to use the same components they might use in the wide area network with a bunch of concerns that dont come up in the data center environment adversarial environments attacks parties that might not trust each other etc so you have a lot of functionalities in these specialized switching components that you really dont need in your data center and you wind up paying for it in dollars and in complexity
6463875 independent of whether our technique is successful or someone elses is five years from now switching and communication infrastructure in the datacenter will be based on these small commodity building blocks
6463876 one of the big benefits of our approach is that it scales trivially to 10 gige at the edge whereas competing techniques rely on aggregation to ever faster links to achieve higher speeds
6463877 if you were to go to 10 gige at the edge for servers today you would need to aggregate to 40 gige or 100 gigelinks moving up the tree topology unfortunately the 40gbps ethernet standard isnt even out yet and when it does become available it will be very expensive because were using identical network elements in our topology today 48 port 10 gige ethernet switches are becoming relatively inexpensive so we would scale trivially to that environment as well
6463878 from a cost perspective to build out a 25 000 node cluster today using current techniques with 100 percent bandwidth just the switching equipment would cost somewhere in the order of 28 million whereas with our technique using the identical network elements would deliver the same performance but incur costs of maybe 4 million thats a factor of seven difference
6463879 going back to the question of 10gige there is no way you could interconnect 25 000 nodes using 10gb ethernet today there just isnt the equipment available for that we could do so at some cost even today but its not insurmountable for somebody who has significant communication and computation needs and the appropriate budget they could use our techniques to deliver 10gige all the way out to the edge servers

6463881 the internet is just a world passing around notes in a classroom
6463882 wanted the list of speakers to showcase the diversity of the republican party
6463883 i think one of the things that is important especially for john mccain as unique a politician as he is is to demonstrate the diversity and differences of ideology i would say of our party
6463884 i think one of the things that people forget about is we are not very monolithic as a party we really want to show some of that
6463885 as long as the commodity side of the business is not being detrimental to our results were satisfied with that
6463886 that was obviously not the picture in this quarter and it wont be next quarter either
6463887 the penalties can go either way but i am pleased the way we fought back during real time after being a goal down the boys did not let their heads drop

6463915 we believe that significant improvements in hospital hygiene must be achieved and we will continue to undertake unannounced hygiene inspections until we are satisfied that the cleanliness of hospitals in northern ireland is of the highest order
6463916 at a time when hospitals are under considerable public scrutiny we believe that these inspections will lead to increased public confidence in our health and social care services
6463917 in all hospitals visited our inspection teams found elements of good practice as well as poor practice
6463918 whilst many of the issues raised within the inspection reports require investment in the fabric of the buildings others can be achieved through a change in culture within hospitals
6463919 basic hygiene and housekeeping issues must become an integral part of everyones daily work
6463920 without a change in the culture there will be a continued barrier to quality improvement and patient safety

6463954 you know im pretty pissed off about the show tuesday night
6463955 we are getting there slowly i was pleased i was really pleased for mookie thats the furthest anybody from toronto has ever gotten in the competition torontos one of those cities that really wants to be new york in many ways and im a toronto boy born and raised here and im so proud of the city in so many ways so yeah i was really pleased to see someone from the city and also someone whos so bloody good get so far
6463956 almost like in a national election ontario has a huge impact on the results and its interesting because the most number of votes do come from this part of the country and yet its the least biased from a voting perspective theyll just vote for whoever is the best singer
6463957 we just sort of said they all were so good and the songs were so well chosen for them that it was one of those things where im not going to be happy if anyone goes and its not going to be wrong if anyone goes
6463958 so you know i agree with you there hasnt been that moment when everyone goes there has been a travesty in the voting mind you i think there were a lot of people that were shocked that mookie left last night you could certainly hear a gasp in the audience but coming from toronto a lot of the fans in the audience its a lot easier to get to are from toronto and are mookie fans he seems to have had more overwhelming support with our live audience in the theatre than others just because of his geography and hes got a local fan base here
6463959 one of the reasons we chose to do it was that we were really hoping that those people who live in those far away communities could have access to the program a bit of my obsession is to be all inclusive you know the u s show goes to five cities and we go to a minimum of 10 sometimes 12 or 13 cities and try to get to as many provinces as humanly possible
6463960 did we have anybody from those communities who was strong enough with the competition at hand not this year but my hope is that the idea that you still have a chance to be on the program and you come from a tiny community in the middle of the northwest territories is really appealing to me
6463961 ive seen people go from down near the bottom to first in a week i saw that happen last season with brian melo when all of the sudden he came out and sang
6463962 so i might have thought gee i dont know if drew can make it the distance but i thought he really just laid himself out there with
6463963 there hasnt been a moment this season where the wrong person went home during any given week
6463964 i think that the girls are taking more of an initiative around setting limits
6463965 a lot of our messaging does focus on the girls simply because there are more health consequences for them around pregnancy and stis sexually transmitted infections
6463966 it was pretty much wear a condom or youll have a baby and your partner will leave you and youll be a teenage mom
6463967 youth in canada are not a homogeneous group and we know theres still lots of work to be done
6463968 if you look at canada as a whole we dont really have one huge sexual reproductive health strategy
6463969 province by province it differs youth in newfoundland are getting more information than youth in b c or quebec in pei theres absolutely no access to abortion

6464014 i wont be disappointed im concentrating on putting my best races on the water thats all i can ask of myself
6464015 if somebody wants to come out and do 1 33 theres probably nothing i can do about it thats the good and the bad its not a combative sport you cant reach out and knock the other guy over all i can do is try to go as fast as i can

6464061 we call for opening up the debates the scope of discussion must be as broad and deep as the serious challenges we face as a nation we agree that vibrant debate is the heart beat of our democracy and our first amendment especially during an election year we recognize that smaller third parties and independents have traditionally played a vital role in our democracy including leading the charge for the abolition of slavery the womens right to vote and economic justice for workers and farmers we support opening up the debates beyond the two parties and the so called commission on presidential debates which is a private corporation co chaired by former chairman of the republican and democratic parties its time for our presidential debates to once again be hosted by truly non partisan civic minded associations

6464118 your cars not starting right your battery may be going out
6464119 traffic why we drive the way we do and what it says about us
6464120 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6464121 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6464122 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6464123 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6464124 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6464125 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6464126 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6464127 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6464128 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6464129 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6464130 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6464131 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6464132 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6464133 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6464134 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6464135 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6464136 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6464137 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6464138 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6464139 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6464140 i left united because i didnt want to spend any more time on the bench i was looking for a new challenge so hopefully i can get more games than i was getting at united
6464141 i prefer to play at centre half and the manager knows my view i could have waited for my testimonial but thats not my mentality
6464142 i believe we have delivered the biggest modernization of the atp tour since its inception have attracted unprecedented levels of investment into mens tennis and have begun to feed the growing appetite for mens tennis globally both in established and emerging markets
6464143 i am honored to have played a part in taking our great sport to the next level
6464144 now that this much needed change has been realized i believe this is the right time for someone new to build on this strong platform
6464145 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

6464174 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6464175 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6464176 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6464177 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6464178 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them

6464183 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6464184 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

6464189 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6464190 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6464191 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6464192 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6464193 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6464194 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6464195 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6464196 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6464197 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6464198 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6464199 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6464200 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6464201 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6464202 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6464203 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6464204 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6464205 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6464206 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6464207 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6464208 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6464209 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6464210 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6464211 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6464212 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6464213 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6464214 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6464215 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6464216 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6464217 who are open to doing something on the production side
6464218 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6464219 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6464220 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6464221 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6464222 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6464223 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6464224 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6464225 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6464226 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6464227 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6464228 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6464229 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6464230 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6464231 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6464232 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6464233 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6464234 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6464235 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6464236 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6464237 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6464238 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

6464241 your cars not starting right your battery may be going out
6464242 traffic why we drive the way we do and what it says about us
6464243 one of the most revealing insights from recent research is how little excitement some people feel about their daily encounter with us
6464244 many of our regular readers regard us like the electric company or water utility
6464245 sometimes when im walking down the street oh oh i hear a song and i just love the beat and i want to tell all my friends
6464246 hey my band would fit in here nicely cause weve got the jangle
6464247 i want to stress that this storm is becoming a serious catastrophic flooding event
6464248 in the past weve usually had flooding in pockets i have not seen anything this widespread throughout the county
6464249 if it was a category 1 2 or 3 hurricane making a direct hit on jacksonville youd have something

6464253 i was trying to tell him a little bit about what we see down here instead of the perks of the nhl obviously bus rides arent the most fun but i dont think hes focusing on that
6464254 by being where i was the past two years speaking to a lot of ex nhl players i felt it was the right time i know where i want to go
6464255 i know theres a lot of work ahead of me
6464256 a lot of that teaching is through experience i know what it takes to get there what a struggle it is
6464257 youll compete a lot harder you dont want to lose those games jamie rivers disappointment in failing to start the season in the nhl sent him into a tailspin that carried him all the way overseas
6464258 the plan for me is to go to camp in atlanta
6464259 i still think theres some nhl left in me if it doesnt work out ill be in chicago id rather be with chicago than any other ahl team
6464260 if i knew when i signed the contract with montreal what i knew when training camp began i wouldnt have signed the contract he said
6464261 i guess it going to russia was like the midlife crisis in hockey the difference this year is im working toward the goal of playing with atlanta but ive come to terms with the chance of playing with chicago nobody has promised me anything
6464262 its usually the upperclassmen who make sure they align to the team goals so to speak bylsma said euphemistically
6464263 what did happen for todd and myself was were a sounding post for each other bylsma said
6464264 but first i have to look out for myself and make sure im in a good situation
6464265 it was 15 or so of your best friends from your town i just remember what a great time we had together that summer
6464266 anytime a big game comes i think everyone is going to be wanting to be pitching and i got lucky it was my turn in the rotation i was fortunate enough to pitch and do well enough to get our team a win
6464267 well thats little league i couldnt control that the age
6464268 it was great it was a dream come true it was a great team great time and you could not ask for anything better for me and my friends it was a great feeling it made me realize what it like to win at a young age

6464272 no beating around the bush i made errors out there
6464273 a big heart and big balls if youll excuse the phrase
6464274 thats what the last 800 metres was all about my arms were gone my legs were gone it was just a case of seeing what was left in my body i didnt fold i gave it everything i left nothing out there no regrets is all you can ask for
6464275 the stretcher made it look more dramatic than it was my body was drained low on sugar i felt bloated sick achy ill sleep well tonight

6464292 brazils central bank believes that it has underestimated the strength of its economy and has moved its previous forecast of 4 5 per cent gdp growth for 2008 up to 4 8 per cent
6464293 having studied figures just released which show brazils current gdp to be 749 billion in 2007 up 5 4 per cent on 2006 the official number crunchers decided that theyd been too cautious brazil does seem to be resilient to the turbulence in the northern half of the americas a turbulence which has sent shockwaves across europe and while the spanish property market is currently down on its luck brazil has the very same to thank for making a major contribution to its current fortune
6464294 judging by the figures from its sister resort pousada dos girassois in pipa which enjoys 80 per cent occupancy per year you could stand to make a lot more

6464296 the property market in natal is in its relative infancy and the coastline is almost development free supply currently lags way below demand
6464297 new development is springing up alongside sporting and leisure facilities but the authorities are paying great attention to the environment before granting licenses aesthetics and stability are of greater importance to them than squeezing every last penny out of every last square metre
6464298 prices of property for sale in natal are incredibly low right now but outside investment in infrastructure such as golf courses and a new airport will increase demand for property and inevitably trigger natural price hikes
6464299 being the closest part of brazil to europe thus drastically cutting down flying times to between seven and nine hours from most european cities natal has phenomenal beaches a permanent summer and with year round rental potential suits both audiences the pure investor and the holiday home hunter
6464300 the investment in the general infrastructure and tourism in the north east of brazil has been significant over the past few years and is set to continue for the foreseeable future
6464301 the government is committed to developing the area and with the new airport just a couple of years away we feel that property in the natal area and along this coastline of brazil offer some of the most exciting investment opportunities we have seen in a long time

6464309 the victim was with a group of friends on the 13th floor of a tower block when they became concerned about another group of youths cycling towards the tower block this caused the victim and his friends to leave the area
6464310 the victim was separated from his friends he climbed onto the outside of the tower block via an open balcony and then climbed down several floors trying to escape
6464311 he reached the seventh floor when he could no longer carry on after this point he fell to his death
6464312 ive heard that he saw a gang chasing someone else and he thought they were carrying knives

6464316 energy suppliers have to take steps towards covering their costs and i am sorry that we cannot delay these price rises any longer
6464317 although this will be little consolation these increases would have been even higher but for the fact wholesale prices have fallen back a little in recent weeks
6464318 soaring energy bills pose a huge threat to our standard of living gas and electricity are essential commodities which have now become a luxury that many can no longer afford
6464319 however you look at it today is a bad news day for consumers consumers are going to have to adjust quickly and there are two key steps to this making sure we pay the lowest possible price for our energy and learning to use less of it
6464320 its not just consumers who are confused about what drives price rises the wholesale price of oil and gas has fallen back in recent weeks but companies still feel the need to raise prices by staggering amounts
6464321 the hard fact is that prices are still set in relation to an irrational and toxic link to the price of oil whether the remedy is to break the contractual link between oil and gas prices or whether it is to find other ways to force greater competition into the european wholesale market it must be the subject of determined and vigorous intervention by competition authorities at home and in europe
6464322 with announcements from government and ofgem expected in the next month we will see whether there is a coherent plan to tackle the myriad failings in this market

6464343 the reality is that barack obamas plans to raise taxes and opposition to producing more energy here at home as gas prices skyrocket show hes completely out of touch with the concerns of average americans
6464344 we invite members of the public to keep a watchful eye on comcast
6464345 practice should further a critically important interest and be narrowly or carefully tailored to serve that interest
6464346 comcasts first reaction to allegations of discriminatory treatment was not honesty but at best misdirection and obfuscation

6464416 to preserve the vibrant and competitive free market that presently exists for the internet
6464417 encourage the deployment on a reasonable and timely basis of advanced telecommunications capability to all americans
6464418 s hould we see evidence that providers of telecommunications for internet access or ip enabled services are violating these principles we will not hesitate to take action to address that conduct
6464419 we will not hesitate to adopt any non economic regulatory obligations that are necessary to ensure consumer protection and network security and reliability in this dynamically changing broadband era
6464420 comcast has several available options it could use to manage network traffic without discriminating as it does
6464421 when comcast judges that there are too many peer to peer uploads in a given area comcasts equipment terminates some of those connections by sending rst packets in other words comcast determines how it will route some connections based not on their destinations but on their contents in laymens terms comcast opens its customers mail because it wants to deliver mail not based on the address or type of stamp on the envelope but on the type of letter contained therein furthermore comcasts interruption of customers uploads by definition interferes with internet users downloads since any end point that is uploading has a corresponding end point that is downloading also because comcasts method sending rst packets to both sides of a tcp connection is the same method computers connected via tcp use to communicate with each other a customer has no way of knowing when comcast rather than its peer terminates a connection this practice is not minimally intrusive but invasive and outright discriminatory
6464422 when an internet user opens a webpage sends an email or shares a document with a colleague the users computer usually establishes a connection with another computer such as a server or another end users computer using for example the transmission control protocol tcp
6464423 comcasts practice is overinclusive for at least three independent reasons first it can affect customers who are using little bandwidth simply because they are using a disfavored application second it is not employed only during times of the day when congestion is prevalent and third its equipment does not appear to target only those neighborhoods that have congested nodes evidence suggests that comcast has deployed some of its network management equipment several routers or hops upstream from its customers encompassing a broader geographic and system area with some equipment deployed over a wider geographic or system area comcasts technique may impact numerous nodes within its network simultaneously regardless of whether any particular node is experiencing congestion
6464424 our power to adjudicate complaints involving requests for access to the networks is surely reasonably ancillary to the effective performance of the commissions various responsibilities
6464425 an agency is not precluded from announcing new principles in an adjudicative proceeding rather than through notice and comment rule making
6464426 comcasts claim that it has always disclosed its network management practices to its customers is simply untrue although comcasts terms of use statement may have specified that its broadband internet access service was subject to speed and upstream and downstream rate limitations such vague terms are of no practical utility to the average customer
6464427 our overriding aim here is to end comcasts use of unreasonable network management practices and our remedy sends the unmistakable message that comcasts conduct must stop

6464459 but there is lots of individual variation within that and we need to be cognizant of that as we think about what our health messages should be

6464464 according to reliable estimates on average china secretly executes around 22 prisoners every day thats 374 people during the olympic games
6464465 everyone involved in this years olympics especially the ioc should be pressing china to reveal the extent of its use of the death penalty to reduce the 60 plus crimes for which it can be imposed and to move toward abolition
6464466 crimes against national symbols and treasures such as theft of cultural relics and the killing of pandas
6464467 very high percentage of the people in china are the communist way
6464468 the world we are familiar with dominated by america and europe is a historical anomaly until the 1400s the largest economies in the world were china and india but then china and india both began to fall apart at just the time that europe began to rise chinas per capita income was actually lower adjusted for inflation in the 1950s than it had been at the end of the song dynasty in the 1270s
6464469 this transition to chinese dominance will be a difficult process for the entire international community made more so by chinas prickly nationalism china still sees the world through the prism of guochi or national humiliation and among some young chinese success sometimes seems to have produced not so much national self confidence as cockiness
6464470 its a difficult balance to get right but we can use that desire also to shame and coax better behavior out of chinas leaders

6464500 now let me be as transparent as i know how to be my tendency each
6464501 the mission we desperately want to reach people who are far from god and help them take steps toward jesus none of us are encumbered by tradition so well do anything to reach them
6464502 is this in contrast to shanes thoughts above or in agreement
6464503 if people want to assess the blame to me thats ok i mean i can take whatever it is that people are going to dish out
6464504 we had good chemistry the hand was back there she was there i dont know what happened
6464505 then i went to grab it and there was nothing its kind of the way its been happening to me this olympics
6464506 but i know its my job to get the guy the baton and i didnt do that
6464507 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6464508 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6464509 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
6464510 the negotiators have taken this very very far but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces operate
6464511 obviously the american forces are here coalition forces are here at the invitation of the iraqi government
6464512 what were trying to do is put together an agreement that protects our people respects iraqs sovereignty
6464513 but the goal is to have iraqi forces responsible for the security of iraq
6464514 that is the goal and that has been the goal from the beginning
6464515 we are making progress together in the defeat of iraqs enemies of all stripes
6464516 were not sitting here talking about an agreement to try to get out of a bad situation
6464517 builds on the success we have had in the last year this agreement is based on success
6464518 really we are very very close to closing this agreement
6464519 and as we said from the beginning there is no hidden agenda here
6464520 but really we are redoubling our efforts to bring this to a successful conclusion
6464521 we as the sadr movement denounce this dubious visit and such timing we reaffirm our stance of rejecting the long term agreement we demand the iraqi government and on the highest levels not to sign this unjust agreement and we demand the withdrawal of the government as soon as possible
6464522 the future of this coalition is linked to the restoration of judges
6464523 if the judges are not restored we will prefer to sit on opposition benches
6464524 if people want to assess the blame to me thats ok i mean i can take whatever it is that people are going to dish out

6464531 if a new president and congress consider changes to the drug benefit it will be important to keep in mind that the coverage gap has consequences for some patients with serious health conditions
6464532 we urge beneficiaries to choose wisely when selecting their drug coverage
6464533 again we emphasize that any changes to the coverage gap would need to come from congress

6464538 i am very pleased to complete this deal which gives us five senior strikers and provides the manager with a good array of attacking options at his disposal
6464539 we know what we need on a global level in terms of reductions
6464540 we cannot continue forever saying this is an issue for the industrial countries and no one else should do anything
6464541 unless we come with a spirit of co operation trying to resolve things instead of making things more and more complicated
6464542 a lot of governments dont have positions yet and are going through internal processes where ideas are still festering
6464543 you train your whole life and you want to win you dont expect to lose
6464544 you dont want it to end this way but its all we could do

6464547 zoals regen of sneeuw neerdaalt uit de hemel en daarheen niet terugkeert zonder eerst de aarde te doordrenken haar te bevruchten en te laten gedijen zodat er zaad is om te zaaien en brood om te eten zo geldt dit ook voor het woord dat voortkomt uit mijn mond het keert niet vruchteloos naar mij terug niet zonder eerst te doen wat ik wil en te volbrengen wat ik gebied
6464548 toen annas en kajafas hogepriester waren kwam het woord van god tot johannes de zoon van zacharias in de woestijn daar ging johannes in de omgeving van de jordaan verkondigen dat de mensen zich moesten laten dopen en tot inkeer moesten komen om zo vergeving van zonden te verkrijgen
6464549 en hij maakte dat goede nieuws bekend in de synagogen van judea
6464550 toen hij aan het meer van gennesaret stond en de mensenmenigte zich om hem verdrong om het woord van god te horen
6464551 dit betekent de gelijkenis het zaad is het woord van god die op het pad zijn zij die het woord horen maar dan komt de duivel en pakt het weg uit hun hart om te voorkomen dat ze gaan geloven en gered worden die op de rotsige bodem zijn zij die het woord met vreugde aannemen wanneer ze het horen maar ze hebben geen wortel ze geloven enige tijd maar op het moment van de beproeving worden ze afvallig wat in de distels valt zijn zij die horen maar gaandeweg worden ze door zorgen rijkdom en de genoegens van het leven verstikt en raken niet volgroeid wat in goede aarde valt zijn zij die het woord met een goed en edel hart horen en vasthouden die volharden en vrucht dragen
6464552 in het begin was het woord en het woord was bij god en het woord was god
6464553 het woord is mens geworden en heeft bij ons gewoond vol van goedheid en waarheid en wij hebben zijn heerlijkheid gezien de heerlijkheid die hij als eniggeboren zoon aan de vader ontleende vervuld als hij was van genade en waarheid
6464554 na hun gebed beefde de plaats waar zij bijeen waren en werden ze allen vervuld van de heilige geest en verkondigden met vrijmoedigheid het woord van god
6464555 en daarom danken wij god dan ook zonder ophouden omdat u het woord van god dat u van ons te horen kreeg hebt ontvangen en het hebt aanvaard niet als een woord van mensen maar als wat het inderdaad is het woord van god zelf dat ook werkzaam blijft in u die gelooft
6464556 zie er dus op toe broeders en zusters dat niemand van u door een kwaadwillig ongelovig hart afvallig wordt van de levende god maar wijs elkaar terecht elke dag dat dit vandaag nog geldt opdat niemand van u halsstarrig wordt omdat hij door zonde verleid werd
6464557 ik zeg jou jij bent petrus op die steenrots zal ik mijn kerk bouwen en de poorten van het dodenrijk zullen haar er niet onder krijgen ik zal je de sleutels geven van het koninkrijk der hemelen en wat je op aarde bindt zal ook in de hemel gebonden zijn en wat je op aarde ontbindt zal ook in de hemel ontbonden zijn
6464558 maar als hij naar hen niet luistert zeg het dan tegen de gemeente als hij zelfs naar de gemeente niet luistert beschouw hem dan als een heiden en een tollenaar ik verzeker jullie wat jullie op aarde binden zal ook in de hemel gebonden zijn en wat jullie op aarde ontbinden zal ook in de hemel ontbonden zijn
6464559 wie naar jullie luistert luistert naar mij en wie jullie afwijst wijst mij af maar wie mij afwijst wijst hem af die mij gezonden heeft

6464614 wir werden versuchen das unausgewogene konzept der telekom zu fall zu bringen
6464615 die deutsche telekom vollzieht zurzeit eine personalpolitik die sich eindeutig gegen die eigenen besch ftigten richtet
6464616 auch auf mittlere sicht m ssen wir uns wegen des enormen nachfragepotenzials der schwellenl nder wohl weiterhin auf h here preise als in der vergangenheit einstellen
6464617 dennoch bleibt der starke anstieg der energie und rohstoffpreise in den letzten jahren im verbund mit anderen risiken ein ernster belastungsfaktor f r wachstum und besch ftigung in unserem land
6464618 dazu z hlt dass der leistungssch dliche anstieg der steuerbelastung durch die kalte progression vermieden wird
6464619 gerade deutschland konnte hiervon bereits in den letzten jahren sp rbar profitieren
6464620 wir gehen davon aus dass die physische nachfrage wegen des derzeit niedrigen preises deutlich anziehen wird so zahlen etwa indische schmuckhersteller den goldimporteuren derzeit wieder deutlich h here preise f r die physische ware

6464630 i am delighted to be supporting this 25th birthday over the years legislation supermarkets and higher costs have all contributed to making life more difficult for local fishmongers but quality always wins through and merchant and reid can be proud of their record of serving the people of aberdeen for so long
6464631 we have seen many changes in the fish trade in the last 25 years but always strive to offer customers quality variety and value for money
6464632 a very right wing parishioner came and was offended by some of the artwork in the church including some indigenous art and an image of a praying monk which they mistook as a buddha
6464633 we have the rich and the poor the happy and the sad the ones who smell bad the homeless and the bankers
6464634 its really messy but its great at the same time because you see glimpses of the kingdom just striking through
6464635 this changed my outlook on what the church should look like and why
6464636 we should be a community of hope for the people of the world and my perspective on how to reach people has been reformed as well instead of making excuses or deals with god you go with the spirit and just help
6464637 i liked the vision that church is not in a building
6464638 i liked the vision of going out on the streets and helping people
6464639 were at the end of project camp but the works not over

6464642 when i judged the game i solely focused on its gameplay big mistake i failed to take into account how where and when the game is used more than a game musika is sort of a toy to play with while you are listening to music music is your 1 concern here gameplay comes second at least on the casual game mode its a game you play while doing something else its a more sophisticated way of drumming your fingers humming or playing air guitar with your headphones on unlike traditional videogames you dont need all your attention to play this game and thats why it succeeds when traditional game criticism says that it should fail
6464643 difficult times call for extreme measures and its clear that some people wont be splashing out on luxuries in the near future people still want quality but its all about value for money
6464644 her hospital visit was precautionary she will be returning home shortly at present she is surrounded by family friends and fabulous jewels
6464645 messy church is our once monthly time for families of all ages to join together in creative worship we get messy the church gets messy and we all have a great time it is a chance to bring families into church who normally would not come on a sunday morning usually these are families who are often already associated with the church in some way with either their kids coming to kids clubs mums and toddlers or youth club messy church becomes a tool of being church in a family friendly way
6464646 we do messy church each month to engage with the families in our community although we have contact with the kids throughout the week we dont always have the opportunity with their parents messy church provides a time to give a simple message to all ages
6464647 messy church is exactly how it sounds messy we chose to have messy church on the third saturday of each month for an hour and a half for the first hour we do crafts each month there is a central theme pentecost christmas easter mountains in the bible specific bible characters the i am sayings of jesus etc and there are at least eight crafts activities around the church for parents and children to do together the crafts vary in difficulty and messiness all the crafts have to do with the theme of the night and the talk also relates to that theme each month the talk is a bit different in presentation although it is always a kid friendly talk we have found that a short puppet sketch to portray the message works well as the kids always love puppets and dont seem to get bored of them before the talk we have two or three songs that the kids enjoy singing at their clubs often the kids like to come to the front and lead the motions for the parents after the talk the service ends with a creative prayer of some sort a bunch of thanks holly wreath of prayer balloon prayers and then we are finished
6464648 the word of god is brought to families in the community who otherwise dont hear it it isnt about getting people into the church it is about spreading the good news of salvation and what better way to spread that news among the parents of your community than through interaction with their kids in a fun and messy way
6464649 it might seem like a lot is required to set up and do messy church but really all you need is a prayerful heart a load of craft supplies and a few willing people in your congregation to come alongside and help on average preparing for messy church takes me the whole of the saturday beforehand and a couple of hours during the week before to write the puppet sketch and gather the crafts
6464650 though less well known in the u s the company is one of the biggest players in the oil market linking buyers and sellers of physical crude oil and refined products it has interests in storage terminals and oil exploration around the world and sold a large refinery in canada in 2006
6464651 a vitol spokeswoman wouldnt confirm that its trading was reclassified by regulators as noncommercial speculation
6464652 swaps dealers sell energy derivatives to clients and are classified by the agency as commercial traders when they make trades to offset risks of those client transactions trades classified as commercial arent supposed to be purely speculative in nature commercial traders get more leeway on exchanges to make large trades although distinguishing between the two can be difficult
6464653 is not in the business of taking large positions speculating on the rise or fall of market prices
6464654 as far as vitol is aware the companys trading status with the cftc is unchanged
6464655 is not in the business of taking large positions speculating
6464656 andrew serotta made the killing for his employer vitol a swiss trading company when he bought 40 000 oil futures contracts nine months ago
6464657 the american who divides his working life between geneva and houston texas is one of many savvy traders profiting from and some say fuelling the soaring price of oil which last week touched 135 a barrel and is expected to force the price of petrol at the pumps in britain to 116p a litre
6464658 the trading activity and profits attributed to mr serotta as stated in your article are based on faulty assumptions and are entirely inaccurate
6464659 further despite your claims vitol is not interested in supporting higher oil prices
6464660 it begins where it ends in nothingness a nightmare borne from deepest fears coming to the unguarded whispering images unlocked from time and distance a soul unbound touched by others but never held on a course charted by some unseen hand the journey ahead promising no more than my past reflected back upon me until at last i reached the end facing a truth i could no longer deny alone as ever
6464661 the reason for the backlog is not in dispute not enough workers to process the claims and not enough administrative law judges to hear appeals of denials

6464682 remember the word that i said to you a slave is not greater than his master if they persecuted me they will also persecute you
6464683 these are the words of him who is the first and the last who died and came to life again
6464684 praise be to the god and father of our lord jesus christ in his great mercy he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead and into an inheritance that can never perish spoil or fade kept in heaven for you
6464685 therefore we do not lose heart though outwardly we are wasting away yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day for our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all so we fix our eyes not on what is seen but on what is unseen for what is seen is temporary but what is unseen is eternal

6464950 dit is natuurlijk een supergrote ontlading spijtig dat het nu al niet binnen is ik was superzenuwachtig bij het starten ben ik door mijn knie gezakt ik was me aan het focussen op mijn lijntje en toen ik vertrok zakte ik door mijn knie en in plaats van mij langzaam op te richten liep ik direct helemaal recht ik dacht dat het gedaan was maar heb dan toch alles gegeven maar toen ik de stok doorgaf aan elodie heb ik twee keer moeten steken bijna tegen het einde van de zone voor de rest verliep alles bij iedereen perfect en ik denk dat we heel dicht bij ons belgisch record van 42 75 zullen zitten in de finale zonder die foutjes van mijn voetblessure heb ik niets gevoeld
6464951 deze tijd is uitstekend zeker in deze omstandigheden het was een beetje glad en het was ook delicater om de stok door te geven we mogen onszelf nu geen druk opleggen en we moeten goed rusten als die twee foutjes met hanna in de finale niet gebeuren dan mogen we hopen
6464952 we zijn echt opgelucht want het is pas de tweede keer dat we met dit team lopen dit jaar en de verenigde staten hebben nog maar eens getoond dat er vanalles kan gebeuren maar zo zie je maar dat onze trainingen op de wissels en de timing lonen we zitten nu met hetzelfde gevoel als in osaka en gaan onszelf niet zot laten maken we zijn waarschijnlijk het enige team dat zichzelf niet te serieus neemt
6464953 vanaf het moment dat je een tijd onder de 43 seconden loopt is het heel scherp en kim zei dat ze heel ontspannen heeft gelopen dus er kan waarschijnlijk nog wat van af dat we de derde tijd hebben van alle finalisten liever een derde tijd dan een zevende tijd natuurlijk de meisjes weten sinds het wk in osaka wat het is en ze moeten nu gewoon rustig blijven ze hebben ook vertrouwen en dat is een enorm voordeel kim was de afgelopen dagen alsof er niets aan de hand was eens bij de groep was de groep weer 100 compleet zij geniet echt van de aflossing ze besefte dat ze de keuze moest maken en door de goede prestatie vanavond is ze nu blij dat ze de juiste keuze heeft gemaakt

6464960 we have over 25 000 alums in the kansas city area and the relocation of these two games with iowa state to kansas city and arrowhead stadium provides an opportunity for us to grow our fan base in the area
6464961 additionally kansas city is a popular destination for many of our fans from kansas and surrounding states as demonstrated by the unparalleled support at our previous four arrowhead contests
6464962 showcasing our brand on a potentially national stage and in a nfl facility is a tremendous asset to our program
6464963 the kansas city metro area is an important market for our institution we couldnt be more pleased to face our north division opponent in arrowhead stadium and be hosted by a first class organization like the hunt family and the kansas city chiefs
6464964 the kansas city chiefs organization initiated discussions with both institutions this summer and offered financial incentives that were very compelling
6464965 both programs are excited about this opportunity and with across the board costs ever increasing we felt this move was a great opportunity for both institutions to be creative and find additional sources of revenue several teams in the big 12 conference have gone to scheduling both conference and non conference neutral site games in recent years

6465025 while the city of kansas city grapples with many important issues the kansas city council goes on vacation to the democratic national convention in denver colorado
6465026 surely the important business of the city of kansas city is more important than going to cocktail parties and hob knobbing with liberal celebrities
6465027 maybe my kansas values are just out of touch with those of the kansas city council
6465028 it is troubling that the kansas city council supposedly a non partisan body would close their doors to attend the democrat convention
6465029 we know the council has always leaned left but this confirms their liberal agenda
6465030 the council is walking away from important issues like whether the kansas city mayor has a volunteer wife and transportation issues like light rail the people of kansas citys business will apparently have to wait until after the councils vacation in colorado

6465080 i imagine theyll probably chop and change a little bit there
6465081 de villiers is a very smart sort of player hes pretty nifty and he sort of controls their backline so as a 12 you have to be pretty on your toes to look after him because he obviously along with butch james controls where theyre destined to go in the backline

6465282 theyre just glad im not strung out doing centrefolds and s t like that
6465283 i think gay people have a wonderful sense of humour i think theyll get it and embrace it
6465284 its an anthem for power of the people for females gays exes anybody whos been broken up with that wants to get over a guy
6465285 new and likely to be viewed with suspicion by both sides
6465286 whether he will have the political courage to really sell it
6465287 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
6465288 and i also feel that americans want us to work together you know former pennsylvania gov tom ridge r is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
6465289 that does not mean we exclude people from our party who are pro choice
6465290 picks a pro choice running mate its not going to be pretty
6465291 effectively destroy ing the republican party and push ing the conservative movement to the bleachers
6465292 the suggestion that obama the proud father of two little girls and others who opposed these bills supported infanticide is deeply offensive and insulting
6465293 was not the bill that was presented at the state level what that bill also was doing was trying to undermine roe v wade
6465294 the words person human being child and individual shall include every infant member of the species homo sapiens who is born alive at any stage of development
6465295 occurs as a result of natural or induced labor caesarean section or induced abortion
6465296 on the childs behalf for damages including costs of care to preserve and protect the life health and safety of the child punitive damages and costs and attorneys fees against a hospital health care facility or health care provider who harms or neglects the child or fails to provide medical care to the child after the childs birth
6465297 was moving to quash only a narrow and innocuous definitional bill identical to federal law
6465298 i can tell you the sponsors always wanted the entire package of bills which were introduced together and analyzed together
6465299 they never wanted them separated because they wanted to make sure that physicians would be chilled into not performing abortions for fear of going to jail
6465300 well whats your opinion about the federal government and the bush administration whats your opinion about the war
6465301 oh you dont really need government everybody can just pull themselves up by their own bootstraps
6465302 it was an individual directing his aggression toward another individual not the school or the students inside the school
6465303 from my perspective obama needs to introduce a game changer and fast before public opinion starts to gel around the notion that he is a phenom who deserves great respect but is not seasoned enough and would be too much of a risk in the oval office
6465304 the mccain campaign believes that some of hillary clintons tactics especially questioning whether obama is ready to lead can be a real winner
6465305 the mccain team has been very open that they went to school on the hillary clinton campaign that they learned from that
6465306 and on this 3 a m ad whats very striking as some have pointed out over the last few days is that barack obama was winning a steady streak of victories against hillary clinton
6465307 and then she ran that ad and she really went on the attack on the experience question and she won the bulk of the primaries thereafter in the closing months of the democratic primaries and won 500 000 more votes than he did and almost took it away from him
6465308 which candidate do voters believe is better qualified to deal with russia mccain by better than 2 to 1
6465309 going after more centrist voters more swing voters more conservative voters who will be a much bigger deal in the general election than they were in those primaries and caucuses
6465310 what the clinton campaign demonstrated is when you bring obama back down to earth its a better battle
6465311 along comes mccain who not only has he doesnt like to talk about his religion very much and then he talks about it openly but he has a very powerful story thats emotionally connected to the audience
6465312 its the candidate who can connect emotionally to middle america who will have the big advantage going down the stretch
6465313 the big question now is whether obama can successfully regain control of the campaign agenda as we head into the democratic convention
6465314 i remember doing it with webcke after training hes the hardest bloke ive ever tackled
6465315 i used to go out every friday and try and knock him over hed just stand there off two steps and block me and id fall on my arse that was about it but hes made of granite that bloke
6465316 i was guilty against the all blacks i fell off a few tackles and i was pretty dirty at myself so i dont want that to happen next game so i take pride in the defence and its got to be up there again
6465317 i imagine theyll probably chop and change a little bit there
6465318 de villiers is a very smart sort of player hes pretty nifty and he sort of controls their backline so as a 12 you have to be pretty on your toes to look after him because he obviously along with butch james controls where theyre destined to go in the backline
6465319 what is he six three or six four almost but hes quick too thats the other thing that you often dont see
6465320 im pretty stoked to be here and i dont take it for granted thats for sure
6465321 but the real reason for me coming across here was to play in different countries and to get that opportunity i think thats the greatest thing that rugby offers

6465325 the u s as the worlds largest market will be able to view and compare sales for the first time outside of their own market

6465327 this partnership represents a great opportunity to benefit not only our clients but the industry as a whole by providing a comprehensive industry supported view of sales across the three largest video game markets
6465328 we are very grateful to start such a valuable service and alliance with npd and gfk chart track limited
6465329 this service gives us the ability to better help game publishers and developers by providing them with a more global view of market performance
6465330 we view the 80 dekalb project as an efficient use of a scarce resource
6465331 t he developer agreed to limit its allocation to 1 5 million per low income unit lower than our 1 7 million ceiling and agreed to permanent affordability for its low income units rather than for just 30 years
6465332 i had no idea people did this for a living
6465333 for me thats the best part they sit perfectly still with their eyes straight ahead totally lost in the stories
6465334 i never wanted to leave rutgers and now i wont have to
6465335 to be part of what rutgers does for the community for the state and for the world its a wonderful thing
6465336 a quite meaningful aspect for me is that the first generation of college goers can go to rutgers camden and be nurtured and moved along in the right direction it has to do with the personal commitment of the faculty rutgers has a faculty and administration personally committed to students success
6465337 your hair looks like a haystack but i like it
6465338 oh the usual slave for life that kind of thing
6465339 she had many male admirers who admired her for her buttocks and curved breasts
6465340 having no family or relatives had made her homeless and being homeless had made her strong
6465341 residents lived in tiny houses and cleanliness was not of the utmost importance
6465342 way too much of our money in their pockets and way too much booze flowing at endless cocktail parties

6465344 even if universal is correct that fair use only excuses infringement the fact remains that fair use is a lawful use of a copyright
6465345 accordingly in order for a copyright owner to proceed under the dmca with a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner its agent or the law the owner must evaluate whether the material makes fair use of the copyright
6465346 allegation that a copyright owner acted in bad faith by issuing a takedown notice without proper consideration of the fair use doctrine thus is sufficient to state a misrepresentation claim

6465353 as you know attorney general guidelines were first implemented in the wake of the fbi abuses of the 1960s and 1970s and serve as one of the most important bulwarks against future abuses
6465354 given the importance of these guidelines providing a period of time for public comment would be a reasonable and responsible way to move forward and achieve the best possible end result
6465355 few people in the history of the national football league have played the game as well as gene and then had another career in football with so much positive impact on the structure and competitiveness of the entire league as gene
6465356 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6465357 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6465358 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6465359 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children i didnt know gene personally i just knew him professionally
6465360 im not going to sell the players on a cap again
6465361 once we go through the cap why should we agree to it again
6465362 gene and i developed a close friendship that remained strong through the good times and some of the nfls most difficult challenges
6465363 we worked very closely on key issues that allowed the nfl to maintain unprecedented labor peace his biggest asset was his understanding of the business of the game and you always knew that his concern for the games best interests guided his actions
6465364 gene was a true pioneer as one of the few african american leaders of a major union
6465365 he was the equal of owners in negotiations and made the league a better place for all players playing alongside of gene was an honor and a privilege he was a pillar of strength and leadership for our great raider teams

6465830 it was a really tough competition i was really close but in the end it wasnt quite enough
6465831 it hurts im upset i came here to achieve a lot more and i just fell short ive come a long way though last year i wasnt even in the mix for medals its been a long road
6465832 im a winner i dont want to be content with silver i will go on ive just got to keep improving
6465833 it would have taken an outdoor personal best to win the gold but ive been in such great form this year i believed i could do it
6465834 in my life ive been through way more discouraging things than that ive had tough times but ive handled them everything is good now
6465835 we have to solidify who will be the guy pretty soon
6465836 robinson has complicated the situation with his improved play he made two interceptions during tuesdays practice at aloha stadium he also played well in yesterdays full tackle scrimmage between the receivers and defensive backs
6465837 we know he can hit he came into games last season and did a great job for us he has game experience
6465838 robinson said he has recovered from surgery to repair ligament damage in his right shoulder
6465839 ive been working hard when i mess up coach miano is correcting me i try to get better every day im here to compete
6465840 my dad was in the penitentiary the majority of my life my brother was in jail things like that i was the man of the house at the age of 14 15 family members were incarcerated i didnt want to go down that road i played football i thought i can do this i had to get on the right track i can do it
6465841 he was one of the first guys to help me out hes a good guy
6465842 most brothers are like you cant talk to my sister hes a good guy
6465843 we had a lot of guys over you need somewhere to sleep come on over
6465844 the monteilhs embraced robinson safety spencer smith cornerback ryan mouton and other defensive backs from the mainland
6465845 keaos dad is amazing he was over 40 years old and he was benching 400 pounds hes a bull and hes old school if youre from the mainland hell teach you the ropes its good hes part of our ohana
6465846 the family is wonderful they treat me like im one of their own i love them like theyre my parents
6465847 a uh tradition is for senior players to design personalized t shirts that are distributed to teammates makala is designing a shirt picturing both her brother and robinson
6465848 its going to be nice were going to have it for the first game
6465849 it was hard being on the side and watching everyone practice
6465850 he looked like he was shot out of a rocket hes a player hes a difference maker
6465851 hes very conscientious hes a pretty intelligent kid and he picks up things if he understands totally what it is that youre asking from him with his desire to want to be the best he can be which i think he does he works hard he focuses well and that helps him to grow as fast as hes grown
6465852 bryant constantly patrols the sideline consulting someone about something eager to soak up advice from his teammates and coaches it has been that way since he arrived in june after two seasons at los angeles harbor college and began offseason workouts with the team
6465853 i felt like it would be good to get to know the defense get to know the coaches and get to know the teammates i just worked every day i tried to get with the veterans as much as i could and a lot of the veterans were really helpful it not only helped me out by knowing my stuff but it helped me by not being afraid to ask the vets in fall camp because i already knew them
6465854 its taking me kind of a long time but people like calvin roberts ryan mouton jameel dowling everybody helping me out it should take me half the time if that because they know exactly what its like to be in my shoes and exactly what i need to learn
6465855 come a great distance when you compare him to some of the guys who have been here
6465856 our team has a lot of aloha for each other and they helped they told him what he was supposed to do in this coverage what you are supposed to play in that coverage how you are supposed to align so he has come along because of the others and because he was here the whole summer
6465857 sometimes you cant see things when you are playing and other people looking in are seeing things i dont just ask the starters i ask everybody
6465858 for a db even a small mistake is a big mistake because they are the last line of defense when you coach a secondary guy you have to make sure you coach every little thing because one step can be the difference between knocking the ball down an interception or a touchdown so sometimes in players eyes they thought they were in pretty good position but in actuality they werent because of where they were and how they got to where they were and if it happens again they are going to be beat
6465859 they tell you straight up if you had a good day or had a terrible day
6465860 bryant had visited hawaii once before when he was 5 so he is still adjusting to the island lifestyle having his wife keshauna and 2 year old daughter jayana with him helps
6465861 things are a lot different from back home back home things are a lot faster here its not slower but its more mellow and chill but im starting to get used to it when you have great people around you it makes it all that much better
6465862 our offensive and defensive linemen go full speed all the time we wanted to make sure we can tackle in the open field and we can catch the ball in the open field we had some really good hits and some really good catches the good thing is we didnt have a lot of missed tackles and there were very few dropped balls so we got out of it what we wanted
6465863 it was good everyone just flying to the ball and trying to make plays
6465864 were trying to work them back and were going to be smart about it we just want to see them run around see them loosen up make sure they know theyre on the same page as the rest of the defense and slowly but surely well get them going into getting more reps its good to have them back though
6465865 being out for two weeks and you see these guys pushing their butts off its hard to just stand on the side and watch them play at the same time elliott is doing a good job thats the best ive seen him play this year hes a changed guy
6465866 you can run all you want but its different between football conditioning and other conditioning
6465867 that only seems fair to give robinson a look e rob and mana have done a good job hes been banged up so much so i havent been fair to e rob from an injury standpoint to get the reps that mana has but mana is new to this program from oregon state so mana needed those reps so now its pretty balanced and we have to decide whos gonna be the guy come florida and that jobs still open and might go down to next week sometime
6465868 im just trying to stay mentally focused and make plays out there thats all i can do
6465869 ive been studying my plays meeting with the coaches and im catching on sitting out for two weeks was tough it was irritating but it all worked out im ready to go now
6465870 hes going to be a great addition hes got big time speed
6465871 i was really excited about the attendance and the enthusiasm i was really proud of heather and my staff its sort of a light night but we got into quite a bit of football
6465872 really theres three corners that are really standing out and hes part of that three in the past we didnt have that kind of depth and quality calvins a starter its just we can only start two of them
6465873 i feel like i got a role on the team and my job is to do the job second team first string whatever it is i feel like i gotta get my job done
6465874 miano is ready to slide roberts in as the teams fifth defensive back meaning hell join the four starting dbs during pass defense coverages as for playing behind newberry lewis and mouton last season roberts didnt think of it as a wasted year even when he was billed in some corners as a man to take one of the jobs outright upon arrival
6465875 it was a learning experience from the real good corners we had last yea so ill learn from them their techniques tendencies and stuff like that i brought it to my game and i think it worked out perfectly for me
6465876 i think its extremely hard for a jc db to come in and learn the techniques because every coach is a little different its probably a lot more complicated than junior college in terms of both in respect to technique and how many coverages we do it takes a while to mentally catch up to the guys who have been here for a while being late and being a jc guy usually that one year theyre going to learn a whole lot theyre going to excel the second year youre going to see what youve got
6465877 im always trying to have time for batting practice and stuff like that im also trying to maybe try playing baseball for uh this season but im not really sure i just always like to keep in tune play catch if i could keep myself sharp i havent got around to talking to coach mike trapasso yet
6465878 hawaiis a little different i dont have my old friends and my family over here i meet my new friends people from all over the country i think its a good deal for me im glad im here
6465879 you cant see the forest from the trees you cant smell your own shit on your knees
6465880 blessed are you when people insult you persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me
6465881 ok that sounds nice but it is just not realistic
6465882 it was one of washingtons biggest scandals and the republican power broker ralph reed was in the middle of it in deep with convicted felon and lobbyist jack abramoff
6465883 but when the senate investigated the senator in charge never even called reed to testify and that senator john mccain and whos now raising money for mccains campaign ralph reed for 26 years in washington john mccains played the same old games we just cant afford more of the same
6465884 however if barack obama wants to have a discussion about truly
6465885 the question now is will barack obama immediately call on the university of illinois to release all of the records they are currently withholding to shed further light on senator obamas relationship with this unrepentant terrorist
6465886 it is an event where the words of hillary clinton are probably going to be exceptionally important
6465887 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
6465888 the fact of the matter is at a certain point when government has not been serving the people for this long people get cynical they tune out
6465889 billy jones and jimmy johnson will have a lot to say about who wins the title
6465890 our hearts are breaking with whats happening with baby colin
6465891 theyll need to locate it first and the poor little guy could have passed away already
6465892 he heard me singing and came over i looked at him and he was full of life he had a few scratches and cuts on him and i was a bit worried about his eyes all he needed is a mothers milk
6465893 there was hope another whale could pick him up and adopt him he could have at least learned to swim with them and eat krill and plankton

6465911 its protectionism in essence what im hearing is unicity and duffys has cornered the market and want the board to maintain that status quo and thats just not right
6465912 i strongly advise the public especially those at high risk for listeriosis such as the elderly pregnant women and those with weak immune systems to make sure they avoid consuming these products
6465913 the pattern was people in certain long term care facilities

6465920 we are hoping that by discontinuing imported waters customers who arent already drinking tap water will consider making the switch
6465921 consumers are not uniformly replacing tap water with bottled water rather they are choosing bottled water over the other beverages available at the store and home
6465922 over 30 million people in the uk enjoy drinking bottled water understanding that it is a convenient and refreshing way to stay hydrated throughout the day

6465929 i dont know anybody that started out at age 2
6465930 my dad stood right there on his knee and helped me sing it
6465931 i really want to be an entertainer i get a lot of that from my father i dont really want to be behind anybody
6465932 he never could stand still on stage and now hes just such a professional stage presence
6465933 i do this because i believe god really wants me to do this in life and for fans
6465934 i always attributed his movement on the field to the way he moved on stage
6465935 he keeps talking about being a prisoner of war back in vietnam great the economy stinks tell me his plan
6465936 i dont like his commercials its like he thinks were stupid
6465937 i was a hillary guy but obama sounds honest and hes young and he understands the modern economy

6465946 it feels like we are lurching from crisis to crisis
6465947 the mod today has the weakest collection of ministers chiefs of staff and civilian leaders since the 1970s
6465948 everybodys working too hard to solve todays problems without thinking about the future
6465949 i have taken a lesson of the past five years of conflict that if you have an economy of force operation it will take far longer to reach your end state it is therefore a false economy
6465950 our focus remains heavily on todays operations the mod is also preparing for tomorrows threats and challenges
6465951 the mod is quite ambitious about what it tries to do with the money available and sometimes it gets stung because of that ambition
6465952 well hes over 100 pitches and its late in the season hes not going to have any extra rest were already falling apart with our rotation i dont understand why thered be second guessing its a no brainer for me if people want to second guess that decision thats fine

6465967 the agreement is further proof that major organisations appreciate the value of our products particularly in the area of child health
6465968 these products are based on many years of research proving good clinical results the safety demands are naturally very high for this type of product our safety data has been a strong factor in facilitating the agreement with nestl
6465969 what we are now seeing in the form sales and earnings growth is the fruit of a long term focus on r amp d and product development and that we have a well functioning business model our market is growing fast and our own brand is gaining increasingly widespread recognition we anticipate continued strong sales development
6465970 this collaboration with biogaia follows several years of searching by bericap to find the best compromise between an efficient system of protection for the ingredients against humidity and a simple and cost effective solution that is easy to understand and to use by the consumer
6465971 what this policy does is try to balance the safety needs of construction owner and contractor and the workers rights as individuals
6465972 every year lot of pilgrims come here from all over india around one hundred thousand visitors are likely to visit for darshan this year too as far as the security aspect is concerned the temple falls under z category high risk area
6465973 we have made very strict security arrangements at dwarkadhish temple all the visitors can be rest assured that they could have the darshan without any fear our security personnel are keeping a watch for 24 hours on all activities
6465974 annual inflation of 30 essential commodities however continues to be range bound between 5 7 per cent and 6 7 per cent in 19 weeks of the current fiscal
6465975 fruits and vegetables are a seasonal phenomenon so there is not much to worry about it they will correct themselves
6465976 inflation i think has already reached 13 per cent mark if we take into account the revised figures
6465977 during the week tea became costlier by two per cent and milk turned expensive by one per cent
6465978 if people want to assess the blame to me thats ok
6465979 i mean i can take whatever it is that people are going to dish out we had good chemistry the hand was back there she was there i dont know what happened
6465980 its way too early to know which if any of these technologies is going to be practical
6465981 but its important for us to get ahead of the curve soldiers are always on the cutting edge of new technologies
6465982 in situations where it is important to win the hearts and minds of the local populace it would be useful to know if they understand the information being given them
6465983 its also important to develop antidotes and protective agents against various classes of drugs
6465984 how can we disrupt the enemys motivation to fight how can we make people trust us more what if we could help the brain to remove fear or pain is there a way to make the enemy obey our commands
6465985 i think most reasonable people if they imagine a world in which all sides have figured out how to control brains theyd rather not go there
6465986 most rational human beings would believe that if we could have a world where nobody does military neuroscience well all be better off but for some people in the pentagon its too delicious to ignore
6465987 the concept of torture could also be altered by products in this market it is possible that some day there could be a technique developed to extract information from a prisoner that does not have any lasting side effects
6465988 experiments indicate that the advantages of these devices are such that human operators will be greatly enhanced for things like photo reconnaissance and so on
6465989 in the intelligence community there is an extremely small number of people who understand the science and without that its going to be impossible to predict surprises this is a black hole that needs to be filled with light
6465990 were not going to be reading minds at a distance but that doesnt mean we cant detect gross changes in anxiety or fear and then subsequently talk to those individuals to see whats upsetting them

6465997 if you had five other lives to lead what would you do in each of them
6465998 to accomplish great things we must not only act but also dream not only plan but also believe
6465999 i think what you see happening is basically this hex is an intriguing character written well by a team who put a lot of thought and care into what they are doing
6466000 its also not a super hero title which is attractive to folks like myself a western with mostly one shot stories you just cant beat that combination this is why you see artists wanting to do this title
6466001 some artists come to hex because they like the book and are looking to do something different sometimes it is a love of the character and sometimes it is a desire to work on stories that allow them to illustrate stories that they might not normally be offered
6466002 thats the beauty of doing a single issue story format it allows an artist to dive into a project that is short and sweet
6466003 as far as the artists are concerned several factors come into play both jimmy and i are good friends with darwyn and he expressed an interest in working with us on hex thats a no brainer thats generally how it works either we have an artist in mind ahead of time and try to get them involved or we customize a script for them artists e mail me often looking to do an issue
6466004 our first hex editor steve wacker brought both jordi and j h williams on board during the first year where jordi bernet is concerned weve developed a great friendship and working relationship with him he loves us and the book so you cant blame us for collaborating as often as possible
6466005 we also work with artists that are less familiar names in the industry there isnt a payment incentive to bolster this little cowboy book
6466006 hex deserves to be just as popular as any batman spider man jla and other similar titles but i guess if it were the book could possibly end up not being as good because too many company eyes would be on it
6466007 i certainly want to do more issues myself or even a graphic novel if the opportunity and schedule presented itself
6466008 i dont know that you can make the comparison of hex to the dcu as a line because the title operates outside the super hero universe in chronology and content
6466009 plus it helps a publisher to diversify their content and support books that show comics arent just capes and tights
6466010 for one thing the collected editions sell well and counterbalance lower selling monthly issues
6466011 were not taking credit for the interest in making the film because it is clear that hollywood is chasing down properties left and right but it had been 30 years since hex first appeared in his own title under the dc bullet
6466012 i cant tell you how many people outside of the comic book industry meaning film tv and video game professionals that have commented on how much they enjoy the book
6466013 in light of that and the film it makes good sense to keep a publishing presence for the character leading into the films release
6466014 at the end of the day hex is a compelling and visually interesting character
6466015 a coming out story that involves unicorns a motel 6 and driving a car into a ditch really
6466016 we cant just keep talking about this can you meet me halfway
6466017 what do you mean halfway i am so halfway in fact if were going to compare i think im like twothirdsway
6466018 no i mean halfway between tucson and flagstaff at the motel 6 off i 10

6466024 poor judgment was used by bringing an airsoft gun one that can be purchased at wal mart on campus that can shoot plastic bbs
6466025 were not going to have any comment until that process is complete
6466026 the reason we had success is because of the process
6466027 we didnt run around saying i want to beat this team and i want to beat that team shoot anybody can do that
6466028 its about doing all the things every day thats how you get good
6466029 i think we worry about going out there and getting better every single day we cant take any backward steps
6466030 of course with such an explosive offense its hard sometimes just to keep up with them
6466031 anyone who watched our games last year our defense did a lot of great things and made a lot of great plays like the offense
6466032 we know what we have to do and we know how we have to play
6466033 we help to build professional networks find contacts or refer them to professional associations
6466034 employer of choice and that we value and appreciate the importance of dual career recruitment
6466035 i work with a really wonderful and diverse group of individuals who have a broad range of expertise and professional backgrounds and who have much to contribute to the toronto employment market
6466036 many of the dual career connection clients from the previous years have become supports to others
6466037 they had public hangings there the people would stand right here on the hill and watch
6466038 she used to tell me mr pack planted this tree because he knew its sweet smell would draw in people from all around to come here this beautiful magnolia is part of my history
6466039 i was just knee high to a grasshopper when my grandmother would sit us down with a coca cola or sweet tea and say stay under the magnolia while she went in to pay her water bill

6466043 new york is not much closer to a statewide network today than it was when this whole process started
6466044 after three rounds of testing it is apparent that this system is not ready to move forward
6466045 the overall sense that i want to communicate in this session is the necessity of thinking about the class as an overall narrative how that first class fits into the overall narrative that the class is going to tell and how that fits into the larger narrative of the students undergraduate experience of their degree in total
6466046 what i hope they come away with is an understanding of the wide range of resources that are available to assist them
6466047 but more important i also hope that they meet people who are in the same boat as they are
6466048 it was really quite interesting to get the students perspective on a lot of different things and it actually was a wonderful convergence some things were reinforced because they were getting them from two completely different perspectives and some things the students said were just brand new
6466049 as much as anything we want people to feel connected
6466050 this allows them to say wow im not the only one whos terrified or whos really trying to figure out how to get started
6466051 the most worrisome issue is possible congressional enactment next year of the employee free choice act by a democratic congress and a democratic president
6466052 card check process but most strongly prefer elections administered by the national labor relations board because it allows them more time to campaign against the union

6466057 yeah ya def dont party harder than me and the crew
6466058 i watched the guys warm up and its hot out there
6466059 i just sat there with my cooling vest on listening to music and just chilled out i think that really paid off
6466060 the majority are using it to block out everything else thats going on around them
6466061 essentially what theyre doing is really not thinking at all theyre just listening to music and being in a space before they actually get ready to narrow their focus
6466062 you have to also plan for contingency if you forgot your music or something happens
6466063 for many athletes that point in time would have been a turning point to really underperform
6466064 kevin drew and broken social scene brendan canning those guys jason collett all the guys from broken social scene thats my favourite band probably
6466065 but to relax myself when im preparing to come to competition i like to listen to some upbeat music
6466066 not before the dives because im the type of guy wholl keep the song in my head and lose focus on what im supposed to think about
6466067 im very electronic techno house music really gets me going
6466068 to start warming up its very helpful it gives me a lot of energy and gets me pumped heading into the warm up and into the meet
6466069 maybe 10 or 15 minutes before i get ready to warm up i dont do a lot of running with an ipod
6466070 i dont let my athletes have headphones and things while theyre warming up i think you have to focus on what youre doing
6466071 you do not isolate your brain from whats important thats just my idea and i know some people think its an old fashioned old man talk
6466072 it was an individual directing his aggression toward another individual not the school or the students inside the school

6466080 mike is evolving into one of the bright young pitching stars in the national league no question about it
6466081 from where he came from early in the season we were questioning whether or not to have him on the staff questioning whether or not to keep him in the rotation and hes pretty much been a huge part of the success weve had here and thats a tribute to him
6466082 there was never any issue with his mechanics or anything of that type he just needed to cross that line and have some success
6466083 the pullback of russian forces is taking place at such a tempo that by the end of august 22 they will be in the zones of responsibility of russian peacekeepers
6466084 one would assume we would have to help them rebuild because they are a partner in the war on terror theyve been helpful they are going to ask us i am sure to replace and rebuild
6466085 hes taken a really serious turn for the worse just now
6466086 the vets have had a look theyve said hes having breathing difficulties his flippers are at an unusual angle hes not going to last much longer you should put him down
6466087 the vets who had a look at him were really surprised at how fast hed gone downhill
6466088 their advice to us was hes not going to last much longer hes suffering and you should take action
6466089 its a really tragic result from an operation that people worked really really hard on
6466090 the plane would not fail to the point of causing a tragedy
6466091 most likely whatever the malfunction of the probe was it is probably not related to what happened
6466092 this breakdown of the peace process is not caused by the milf we have been very consistent we have been very observing the cease fire but in spite of all of this the government does not honor its commitments
6466093 its in tatters its in tatters i dont know how to pick up the pieces
6466094 i think things look really grim at the moment i think theres a good chance that it will be a while and i mean years before we can get back to where we were before the court order stopped the agreement from being implemented
6466095 but i think as well there are real questions about whether either party negotiating the agreement did enough work with its own constituents
6466096 theres been some fairly bellicose statements coming out of the armed forces
6466097 i think probably both sides would prefer not to have to go back to conflict but what was holding hostilities back was the prospect that peace was at least if not around the corner on the horizon and now its a big question mark

6466104 we have an existing cooperation between usda and the chinese ministry for science and technology
6466105 we cooperate on several initiatives signing this protocol represents formal cooperation in the area of biofuels research
6466106 todays signing establishes a virtual joint center for a series of projects that are very specific to the two centers
6466107 we also intend to include universities and business in both china and the united states we can now focus on specific areas of cooperation
6466108 we will work on sweet sorghum conversion to ethanol and the use of cellulosic sorghum for ethanol
6466109 whether its for grain sugar or a high tonnage source of lignocelluose most in attendance at this conference are committed to making sorghum the preferred dedicated feedstock for production of ethanol and other liquid fuels
6466110 this is a milestone for the sorghum industry and for our members as the world turns its attention to sorghum sorghums water sipping qualities short growing season and ability to grow on 80 percent of the worlds land including some marginal agricultural areas really lends it to biofuels production as the u s and the world face pressing issues with energy independence and economic difficulties
6466111 for the last couple of years the cotton market has been tantalized by forecasts of insufficient acreage higher demand and bigger production deficits for the deferred months and in each of those years the forecasts for the tightness have faded and the end result has been the largest carryouts in 40 years
6466112 and we were almost off to the races however after that our carryouts went from 5 4 million to 9 8 million bales an increase of almost 5 million bales
6466113 it doesnt take a rocket scientist to figure out that the carryout will continue to grow until we get a burdensome supply again for this year
6466114 the crop today is at a very critical stage and needs rain immediately if not the crop could be a disaster and u s exports would be the largest beneficiary of that
6466115 one is that the cost of agricultural inputs has risen sharply india is struggling with the high cost of fertilizer and will see a cutback in its use of it two sharply higher transport cost for inputs in countries like brazil which have to import those inputs will cut into profits
6466116 in 2006 07 usda originally estimated chinas imports at 18 5 million bales in july they moved it up to 20 million bales the final import numbers were 10 8 million bales 9 2 million bales less
6466117 in 2007 08 usdas first estimate of chinas imports were at 20 5 million bales but july it was 16 5 million bales and today theyre at 12 25 million and we think its closer to 11 5 million thats another 9 million bale drop off the forecast imports for china
6466118 the 2008 09 season is continuing that trend as usda initially forecast 17 million bales of chinese imports and that is already down to 13 5 million bales
6466119 these statistical adjustments will account for all the slippage in the balance sheet as that happens the screws will be tightened and we will finally drive it in at that point the numbers will finally reflect reality
6466120 a very scary number especially when you measure it against the u
6466121 so we have to ask ourselves if the screws have been tightened all the way down on the statistics or do we need one more year of adjustment this will determine if the cotton market is really set to take off
6466122 if we start the year with roughly 5 5 million to 6 million bales and we maintain all our planted acreage we will get a production of 14 7 million bales a carryout of 6 million bales and a total supply of 20 7 million bales
6466123 if domestic use drops to 4 4 million bales and exports stay around 15 million bales all of a sudden we will find ourselves with an ending stocks figure of 1 3 million bales that number is impractical but it will be extremely bullish on prices
6466124 in 2010 if u s domestic use is maintained at current levels which is very possible due to the domestic support payment in the new farm bill we could find ourselves with a projected negative carryout of a 500 000 to 1 million bales
6466125 i dont think i can make this point any stronger
6466126 if the 2008 09 statistics look like theyll hold together this time then the market will have to react and it will have to react long before the planting of the 2009 crop in order to attract cotton acreage back into production away from what is now profitable grain production
6466127 i want cotton folks to know im their friend i believe in agriculture and that if we let the family farmer fail weve failed as a nation
6466128 and i wanted to be sure we had an advocate for agriculture
6466129 with constantly rising energy costs were finding it harder and harder to stay in business
6466130 with declining cotton acres over the past three years weve gone from ginning 30 000 bales to only 6 000 last year our cotton warehouse is getting smaller and smaller in past years weve employed 40 seasonal workers now were just in survival mode
6466131 we sell fertilizer seed and chemicals and government regulations and environmental restrictions have made it more difficult to compete and have made our operations more expensive and harder to finance
6466132 weve added non agriculture related businesses to try and allow us to hold on to our ag operations
6466133 but energy is by far the biggest problem people are having to choose between the gas pump and the grocery store costs are moving up so fast were having to spend all our time on efforts just to meet expenses
6466134 were passionate about what we do and we want to stay in this business
6466135 we ginned 79 000 bales at our two gins in 2006 in 2007 we ginned 44 000 this year we expect it will be less than 25 000
6466136 this trend all across the mid south is having a dramatic effect on local economies
6466137 well run just one of our gins and our normal complement of 56 seasonal employees will be cut in half
6466138 fuel and energy costs are astronomical we used to dry a bale of cotton for 1 now its 6 just for energy
6466139 now theres just one in addition to the problems of declining acres energy costs etc increasing problems with regulatory agencies labor shortages and immigration and customs enforcement are adding complexity and costs to our operation
6466140 our volume has gone from 54 000 bales in 2006 to 28 000 last year and probably 25 000 this year
6466141 the wild price swings have increased market uncertainty and greatly affected our ability to use these pricing functions
6466142 liquid nitrogen that was 300 this year is going to be 600 in 2009 increases of this magnitude will mean less cotton and corn
6466143 even though grain prices are much higher with these high input costs our margins remain the same inputs are killing producers
6466144 the cotton market was as high as ive seen but few producers could take advantage of it because markets werent functioning as they should we couldnt hedge our risks if producers dont have some sort of price discovery mechanism in a fair open manner they cant price their products
6466145 we have insisted that any reductions should come with increased market access for u s commodities so far that has failed to materialize
6466146 we havent had an energy policy since jimmy carter was president our only policy has been to let the energy companies get richer and richer
6466147 i personally shop at the grocery store and i see how the prices of milk eggs and everything else have gone up all due mainly to energy and transportation costs i dont know a farmer anywhere whos better off as a result of high food prices
6466148 weve got to quit being so dependent on foreign oil there are a lot of bright minds in this country and i believe they can come up with ways to solve this problem
6466149 anti american push backs i think we should look at each agreement on its merits before its approved
6466150 in the midst of these very challenging times there are some very positive things going on and despite the problems we believe cotton will come back
6466151 we need a level playing field a chance to compete fairly and ways to deal with input costs

6466163 la divulgazione dei nostri sport dama e scacchi uno degli aspetti di cui ogni damista scacchista dovrebbe farsene carico e secondo me un grande pregio che distingue il vero appassionato dal semplice spingitore di pezzi qualunque categoria di gioco esso sia
6466164 haitian fight song potrebbe anche intitolarsi afro american fight song lassolo che io prendo in questo pezzo pieno di concentrazione non posso suonarlo nel modo giusto se non penso al pregiudizio allodio alla persecuzione e a quanto tutto ci sia iniquo in esso c della tristezza e ci sono delle grida ma c anche della determinazione quando finisco di suonare di solito penso io glielo ho detto spero che mi abbiano ascoltato
6466165 la parte reazionaria del discorso del comico lo sfott c una grande differenza fra il teatro sfott e il teatro di satira il teatro di satira sempre morale basti pensare al timore al panico che hanno avuto sempre i potenti davanti ai problemi della satira perch la satira in molti casi ha determinato la presa di coscienza della gente soprattutto delle classi inferiori ha fatto capire di avere il potere di ribaltare le situazioni di avere il coraggio quindi temuta qual la differenza che esiste fra fare satira e fare sfott allora posso dire a un giovane attento che giocare esclusivamente sulla pura caricatura legata a un personaggio anche a un uomo politico che grasso piccolo magro magari ha la gobba magari si intartaglia non realizza niente questo fa fare soltanto una risata fine a se stessa ma se non c la dimensione morale se tu attraverso la satira non riesci a far capire il significato opposto delle banalit dellovvio dellipocrisia soprattutto e della violenza che ogni potere esprime e porta addosso ai minori ebbene il tuo ridere vuoto proprio lo sghignazzo ventrale e non quello dello stomaco e dei polmoni

6466200 de cualquier forma todos los pilotos estamos en las mismas condiciones desde luego nosotros hemos preparado a conciencia esta carrera pero las impresiones que tendremos en pista a partir de ma ana ser n fundamentales
6466201 voy a trabajar muy cerca de mis ingenieros en los pr ximos d as porque necesito tener muchos datos
6466202 nosotros lo hemos solicitado y lo hemos debatido esta ma ana con el coi y somos respetuosos con su decisi n de no permitirlo
6466203 felizmente ayer en la tarde a la vuelta del partido turqu a chile el presidente mayne nicholls recibi un correo de la federaci n espa ola que confirmaba que en septiembre se iban a ver todos los detalles
6466204 un grupo que ven a de ganar casi todos los partidos
6466205 no hay que perder la perspectiva y hay que saber que estos son partidos amistosos y de pretemporada aunque no me gusta perder ni en los amistosos pero debemos seguir adelante sacar lo positivo y trabajar y seguir mejorando
6466206 hacer un buen partido y poder tener una semana tranquila
6466207 he tenido muy buena sensaci n lo conoc a por v deos de las carreras de hace un mes de gt y f3 de los planos que ten a pero caminando y vi ndolo in situ he confirmado la idea que ten a
6466208 dif cil denominarlo urbano es un semi permanente normal y corriente pero con las vallas pegadas en las rectas es el polo opuesto a m naco
6466209 diferente a m naco o a lo que ser singapur
6466210 hay tramos ciegos pero en teor a las banderas amarillas tendr an que ayudar en caso de que en una curva que no pudieras ver a la salida si hay alguien parado
6466211 del mismo modo continu hay partes que se estrechan bastante como la zona del puente pero son los riesgos y trampas que tiene todo circuito urbano m naco no permite ning n error y valencia pese a ser m s ancho menos bacheado y estar todo m s calculado no va a permitir tampoco errores esa es la salsa de los circuitos urbano
6466212 a trescientos kil metros por hora va a cambiar mucho respecto a las sensaciones al caminarlo hoy se va a volver todo m s estrecho y m s dif cil pero as a priori es de esos circuitos que te gustan bien preparado todo calculado a estrenar todo nuevo
6466213 de hecho prosigui hay curvas que ahora piensas que son de una manera y luego te subes al coche y algunas partes no tienen nada que ver con lo que hab as programado cuando te subas seguro que hay sorpresas pero lo m s importante es aprovechar las tres horas que tendremos de entrenamiento para dar el mayor n mero de vueltas para tener m s confianza
6466214 est claro que espa a est al frente de automovilismo y otros deportes
6466215 la que viene es una semana importante para nosotros perder amos todo el trabajo de la pretemporada si no pasamos la eliminatoria el equipo es consciente de lo que se juega hay que ir con la intenci n de ganar sabemos que nos espera un ambiente dif cil y el equipo tiene que estar preparado para ganar y volver a europa
6466216 el deportivo demostr que fue superior al rival pero no pudo meter gol hay que mantener la l nea en croacia y el gol llegar tarde o temprano el favorito tiene que seguir siendo el deportivo aqu vinieron a encerrarse atr s y si quieren pasar tendr n que arriesgar as que eso nos tiene que favorecer
6466217 la gente pensaba que el hajduk iba a ser un equipo m s flojo pero aqu nos cost meter un gol defensivamente estaban bien y aunque no es un mal equipo no es superior al deportivo as que si queremos seguir en europa hay que ganar
6466218 uno siempre se siente no se si l der pero s importante en un equipo cada futbolista se tiene que sentir til con la marcha de coloccini y la baja de manuel pablo no s si soy el l der pero s que quiz por experiencia tenga que estar ah un poco m s
6466219 circuito valencia es rapid simo nada que ver con m naco
6466220 a ver si se puede intentar que todos los pilotos nos podamos juntar en el pit lane antes de salir ma ana a los entrenamientos y guardar un minuto de silencio creo que es lo m nimo que podemos hacer pero no depende ni de m ni de los pilotos estas cosas se mueven por otros sitios

6466257 there was never any issue with his mechanics or anything of that type he just needed to cross that line and have some success

6466281 mi hermosa cydney que ha compartido conmigo los buenos y malos momentos
6466282 elegimos revelar a estos tres primero porque nos parece que son bandas que est n en un buen momento est n activos sus videos y su m sica est en rotaci n y les est yendo muy bien
6466283 en el caso de belanova originario de guadalajara pues es como el simbolismo del estado en el que se van a realizar
6466284 no queremos descartarlo porque el a o pasado nos divertimos mucho pero hasta ahora no es l
6466285 denisse se siente mal tuvo un problema con sus cuerdas vocales as que tuvo que cancelar varios de sus contratos que ya ten an firmados con belanova
6466286 al parecer ya est mejor pero en d as pasados s se sinti muy mal ha estado el mayor tiempo en descanso y eso es lo que le ha ayudado para que se vaya recuperando pronto
6466287 pienso que ani producto de la sensaci n de p rdida que debe estar viviendo se sinti motivada para decir esto pero creo que ayer ella subi un mensaje a la red donde pide que mejor no se haga la marcha
6466288 el apoyo se puede externar a trav s de otros medios como internet y sobre todo por el cuidado de los ni os
6466289 es indudable que el p blico busca la manera de externar su cari o y apoyo a los rbd pero creo que se debe reconsiderar la opci n podr an ponerse en riesgo todos los involucrados y no es la forma de lograr que el grupo permanezca el resultado ser a una histeria total
6466290 se defini en conjunto el grupo lo platic conmigo no lo determinaron unos cuantos ellos expresaron su deseo por continuar creciendo en solitario y atender asuntos personales
6466291 es el resultado de la emoci n que genera dejar un grupo tan importante que logr cautivar a la gente de una manera tan especial
6466292 la ventas van muy bien lo que est sucediendo no ser a real en caso de que ellos no tuvieran el xito que mantienen hay una p gina en la que se est n recolectando firmas para que el grupo no se desintegre y rebasan los tres millones esa reacci n mundial es un apoyo definitivo de los fans
6466293 les recomiendo que disfruten su despedida todo lo que han vivido hasta ahora ha sido maravilloso no s lo en m xico sino a nivel mundial est n preparados para lo que viene no crean que va a ser tan f cil hay que empezar desde cero rbd son seis y ahora como individuales tendr n que trabajarle muy duro
6466294 some people are wealthy and rich in their lives and their children and their ability to educate them
6466295 thats a slap in the face to the two three and four millionaire voters out there
6466296 its bad enough we are referred to as porch millionaires by those five and up millionaire snobs well at least our group doesnt look down on anybody not even the poor billionaires
6466297 so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god
6466298 for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the lord
6466299 god is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent hath he said and shall he not do it or hath he spoken and shall he not make it good
6466300 but this i say he which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully every man according as he purposeth in his heart so let him give not grudgingly or of necessity for god loveth a cheerful giver
6466301 be not deceived god is not mocked for whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap
6466302 but my god shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by christ jesus
6466303 the blessing of the lord it maketh rich and he addeth no sorrow with it
6466304 i love them that love me and those that seek me early shall find me riches and honour are with me yea durable riches and righteousness
6466305 blessed be the lord who daily loadeth us with benefits even the god of our salvation selah
6466306 and let us not be weary in well doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are of the household of faith
6466307 antes de salir de m xico mi mam me dijo que viniera por la medalla de oro le cumpl esta presea es para ella y para todo m xico es el fruto de 23 a os de trabajo y dedicaci n me entregu con el coraz n para obtenerla
6466308 en ese momento temblaba por completo me sent muy emocionado sent c mo todo el cuerpo se me erizaba desde los pies hasta la cabeza fue fenomenal y luego el himno nacional y el izamiento de la bandera nunca lo podr olvidar en esos momentos pensaba en la motivaci n que me dieron los triunfos de las mujeres ltimamente
6466309 but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him
6466310 ephesians 2 8 so it should not come as any surprise that the devil wants nothing more than to get you into doubt and unbelief
6466311 and jesus looking upon them saith with men it is impossible but not with god for with god all things are possible
6466312 god knows my need and will take care of it
6466313 for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts
6466314 what do you mean believe that it has come i dont see it im still in need
6466315 then peter opened his mouth and said of a truth i perceive that god is no respecter of persons
6466316 there isnt enough of it going around see all the people around you are getting blessed none left for you
6466317 for every beast of the forest is mine and the cattle upon a thousand hills

6466320 for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not thither but watereth the earth and maketh it bring forth and bud that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater

6466323 he talked about commitment and he asked are you ready
6466324 our career services has refocused their core programming to be more self reflective for students
6466325 we ask what does it take to be a leader what are your weaknesses and what can you work on
6466326 its pretty unlikely that people will buy these things after the olympics
6466327 chinas economic and financial market challenges have little to do with the olympics and more to do with slowing global demand rising input costs and domestic imbalances
6466328 because of the subprime lending crisis in the u s american merchants are reducing their orders or not paying on time
6466329 it has given us a chance to reflect on how well balanced a country we really are
6466330 they had this idea about nordic people being very reserved and very serious
6466331 i just chose a simpler lifestyle one where i could ride my bike all over and where i dont have to make a great living to survive
6466332 the gist of it is that you dont have to do anything except let go
6466333 its a combination of relaxing eating drinking partying spending time with family
6466334 our neighbors love us for it but they just cant get it
6466335 the volumes of deals with shares included in the index representing list on august 21 compared to the previous trading day in kzt increased by 16 5 times and amounted kzt266 9 million usd2225 thousand
6466336 six days thou shalt labour and do all thy work but the seventh day is the sabbath of the lord thy god in it thou shalt not do any work thou nor thy son nor thy daughter nor thy manservant nor thy maidservant nor thine ox nor thine ass nor any of thy cattle nor thy stranger that is within thy gates that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou and remember that thou wast a servant in the land of egypt and that the lord thy god brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm therefore the lord thy god commanded thee to keep the sabbath day
6466337 but the wicked are like the troubled sea when it cannot rest whose waters cast up mire and dirt there is no peace saith my god to the wicked
6466338 and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever and they have no rest day nor night who worship the beast and his image and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name
6466339 for christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth
6466340 and be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of christ the righteousness which is of god by faith
6466341 come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light
6466342 god i trust you and know you are handling it
6466343 now it came to pass as they went that he jesus entered into a certain village and a certain woman named martha received him into her house and she had a sister called mary which also sat at jesus feet and heard his word but martha was cumbered about much serving and came to him and said lord dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone bid her therefore that she help me and jesus answered and said unto her martha martha thou art careful and troubled about many things but one thing is needful and mary hath chosen that good part which shall not be taken away from her
6466344 therefore i say unto you take no thought dont worry for your life what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink nor yet for your body what ye shall put on is not the life more than meat and the body than raiment behold the fowls of the air for they sow not neither do they reap nor gather into barns yet your heavenly father feedeth them are ye not much better than they
6466345 certainly a few thoughts of worry are normal it doesnt mean ive stopped following god
6466346 no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other ye cannot serve god and mammon therefore take no thought
6466347 i am the lord thy god which have brought thee out of the land of egypt out of the house of bondage thou shalt have no other gods before me
6466348 1 kings 18 21 do you believe in jehovah god today
6466349 and a certain man lame from his mothers womb was carried whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called beautiful to ask alms of them that entered into the temple who seeing peter and john about to go into the temple asked an alms and peter fastening his eyes upon him with john said look on us and he gave heed unto them expecting to receive something of them then peter said silver and gold have i none but such as i have give i thee in the name of jesus christ of nazareth rise up and walk and he took him by the right hand and lifted him up and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength
6466350 and peter fastening his eyes upon him with john said look on us and he gave heed unto them expecting to receive something of them
6466351 now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen
6466352 and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will i do that the father may be glorified in the son if ye shall ask any thing in my name i will do it
6466353 not i might do it or maybe it will or wont happen because with god you never know
6466354 but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him
6466355 commitment isnt the time you spend its a line you cross
6466356 no matter what it looks like no matter how i feel no matter what everyone else is saying no matter what my eyes see no matter what my hands touch no matter how much the pain hits no matter what is trying to consume my thoughts i will not waiver
6466357 casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ
6466358 the only part of the bible im interested in is the part about me not going to hell
6466359 ye lust and have not ye kill and desire to have and cannot obtain ye fight and war yet ye have not because ye ask not ye ask and receive not because ye ask amiss that ye may consume it upon your lusts
6466360 but what i asked for was a good thing it wouldnt have hurt anyone it was an unselfish prayer
6466361 for verily i say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore i say unto you what things soever ye desire when ye pray believe that ye receive them and ye shall have them and when ye stand praying forgive
6466362 and when ye stand praying forgive if ye have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses

6466373 id say that within the last 72 hours we got well over 3 inches nearly across the whole county
6466374 the temperatures were above average with below average rainfall so our wheat crop to say the least is not a very good one compared to the year before
6466375 it was kind of on the tail end of our irrigation season for corn
6466376 it will probably save an inch or two on irrigation on most fields
6466377 over the past four days weve had anywhere from an inch and a half to two inches not a lot
6466378 weve actually had enough of the scattered showers around that its kept the range in decent conditions but this should sure give us a boost going into the fall
6466379 all those areas were hit very hard with unseasonably and unusually heavy rainfall that in some places flooded arroyos and creeks it caused some evacuation and for awhile the closing of u s highway 83
6466380 its a crop area that is already in bad shape
6466381 forb broad leafed plants production was next to nothing in the spring nesting and fawning habitat at least in the immediate uvalde area has been pretty grim

6466435 a coracle is not usually associated with rowing in norfolk but it needs only about four inches of water to float so it will be very useful around the area of regdrave fen the source area of both the little ouse and waveney
6466436 for some time ive mused on norfolk being an island bounded on two sides by the sea and on the other two sides by the river waveney and the great and little ouse
6466437 i decided it would be a wonderful adventure to make a trip around norfolk by water and now i am doing it for charity in all the time i have been planning the trip i havent heard of anyone who has attempted the voyage before but anyone has i would certainly be interested to hear from them
6466438 the idea for my marathon row came after i accompanied a friend who marked his own half century by rowing the 50 miles from norwich to lowestoft and back said robert i thought if we could do that in a day i could with careful planning and preparation complete a circuit of norfolks boundary in 10 days or so
6466439 even things like fallen trees can add quite a bit of time
6466440 ive found so many lovely bits of norfolk that i didnt know existed later i will definitely go back and explore them at my leisure

6466449 i stayed there for two months to meet various people and gathered all the relevant information then i completed the script
6466450 it is not a biography on pt ravi shankar i met him there and explained that i am not making a biography on him otherwise i would have taken his permission

6466469 we deny the report we have no information whatsoever that would indicate that the french soldiers were killed by nato planes
6466470 none of the wounds sustained by those killed or wounded were consistent with air delivered ordnance
6466471 if they had engaged there might have been considerable if bombs had been used
6466472 no french soldier at any time during the incident came on the radio to say that they were taking and no french soldier after the event has mentioned to the chain of command that this might have been the case
6466473 i am urging people to watch my film because the idea and its treatment is very fresh it is a very out of the box comedy

6466475 my film is a satire a black comedy it has all the madness a comedy has and is also packed with moral values

6466482 diese ergebnisse bedeuten aber nicht dass die jugend weniger engagiert ist sondern eher dass sie sich nicht mehr mit den aktuellen strukturen identifizieren k nnen

6466490 the special non invasive advances in fetal and neonatal evaluation network gefunden
6466491 wir wollten wissen mit welcher sicherheit die untersuchung fetaler dna in m tterlichem blut vorhersagen kann ob eine anti d prophylaxe vor der geburt ben tigt wird wir wollten auch wissen wie sicher die jetzige rhesusfaktor bestimmung bei neugeborenen ist
6466492 diese m tter h tten keine anti d prophylaxe gebraucht
6466493 hochgerechnet sind das auf deutschland bezogen rund 46 000 frauen pro jahr die eine rhesus prophylaxe bekommen obwohl sie diese nicht ben tigen
6466494 unser labor an der universit tsmedizin g ttingen ist das einzige bundesweit das dieses nicht invasive verfahren bei solchen risiko schwangeren routinem ig durchf hrt
6466495 das untersuchte nachweisverfahren k nnen wir allerdings noch nicht f r alle schwangeren mit rhesusfaktor negativ anbieten dazu m ssten erst die entsprechenden richtlinien des bundesausschusses der rzte und krankenkassen und der bundes rztekammer angepasst werden
6466496 the determination of the fetal d status from maternal plasma for decision on rh prophylaxis is feasible
6466497 die vielzahl der tarife und sonderaktionen sorgt nicht zwangsl ufig f r mehr wechselbereitschaft beim kunden viele kunden bleiben lieber ihrem anbieter treu als sich mit dem tarifwirrwarr auseinanderzusetzen
6466498 da helfen auch die t glichen call center attacken der anbieter nicht weiter um den kunden mit halbseidenen angeboten zu berrumpeln und ihm teure vertr ge aufzuschwatzen das f hrt im endergebnis noch zu einer h heren ver rgerung der verbraucher
6466499 die praxis zeigt dass es vielen tk unternehmen nicht gelingt ihren werbespr chen gerecht zu werden sie schlagen sich anscheinend lieber in ihren kundendienst abteilungen mit den auswirkungen und symptomen schlecht konzipierter produkte und services herum und bet tigen sich in der brandbek mpfung ohne die ursachen wirklich zu beheben
6466500 besonders bei den festnetzanbietern bekommt man zuweilen den eindruck dass sie alles tun um m glichst viele servicevorf lle zu generieren
6466501 all das f hrt schnell zu kundenfrust mitarbeiter sind oftmals nicht in der lage ein problem am telefon zu l sen da sie lediglich f r einfache ausk nfte die so genannten faqs geschult sind und ber keine oder geringe vollmachten verf gen um ein kundenanliegen schnell und unb rokratisch zu l sen
6466502 diese mehrfach kontakte werden dann zum echten problem wenn anfragen ber unterschiedliche eingangskan le nicht einem vorgang zugeordnet werden k nnen diese f higkeit besitzen leider die wenigsten unternehmen zudem gibt es oftmals keine ad quate m glichkeit einfache vorg nge schnell selbst zu erledigen wer es gewohnt ist seine fl ge online zu buchen den telefonischen quick check in bevorzugt und sitzplatzreservieren per sms liebt der hat wenig spa bei den meisten angeboten der telefonfirmen zur selbstadministration per telefon oder im internet
6466503 es spricht einiges daf r dass hnlich wie bei den fluggesellschaften gut gemachte self service angebote auch angenommen werden die die anzahl der kundenanfragen senkt und damit die kunden zufriedenheit steigert
6466504 last nights win for mccain will most likely mean that he will be nominated as the gop candidate and that is absolutely horrendous to me to the point that i dont think i can go out this november and pull the lever for him i just dont think i can do it john mother frickin mccain what is happening to the republican party
6466505 the reason theyre on the republican ticket is the fact that they have fundamental core beliefs that are attributed to the republican party you cant assume that every person in the same party has the exact same beliefs as their peers
6466506 mccain is good on the war which is great but is adamantly opposed to water boarding which has been proven to work and is not torture

6466512 we are trying to understand the regulation of processes that are fundamental to normal cell development and health in humans
6466513 defective cilia are implicated in a wide range of serious illnesses such as polycystic kidney disease retinal degeneration and neurological disorders inappropriate activation of signaling molecules that normally reside at the primary cilium may lead to certain cancers
6466514 ciliogenesis is a fundamental process these structures are found in almost every type of human cell you can imagine

6466523 these riders are sophisticated and are very knowledgeable as i said the testing has become so sophisticated its quite possible that they just made a mistake but i find it shocking that they would take that kind of risk
6466524 the idea is these horses cant tell their riders if they re in pain
6466525 they cant express if they can endure the pain with an aspirin or if they need to be pulled out of the competition thats why if a horse has any kind of injury he must be removed from the games its as simple as that
6466526 well have a positive drug test and everybody will go oh my god how did this happen

6466557 whilst the deadline has passed for miners to lodge claims there are still many claims awaiting settlement some of which may take up to two years before a successful conclusion is reached therefore the site is still critical for solicitors to continue to track the progress of any outstanding claims it is now updated by capita who administer the services for berr providing information such as requests for more health information for each miner progress on claims and the details of the claims settlements
6466558 the big challenge for the team here at wtg was that we were dealing with a service coming close to the end of its lifecycle we had to deal with end users of the site who were used to the way it works but were migrating from entering claims to their management through the process of settlement the fact that we are able to ensure that the servers and software are supported and maintained for the life of the project while ensuring that solicitors can still access the information for their clients means that we were able to deliver against objective and budget

6466570 the umpires dont kick him out but the league suspends him thats a first isnt it i havent seen that
6466571 my intent was to make the opposing pitcher feel as uncomfortable as i did the at bat before
6466572 the way the league interpreted it it seems like they feel i was trying to hit him
6466573 i dont know if he really tried to hit me
6466574 maybe he was trying to take me out of the game a little bit and mess with my concentration on the game
6466575 if im going to hit somebody itd be position players in that situation that wasnt on purpose i had two men on base and two outs if i hit him i have to face the no 9 batter i just tried to throw inside and the ball went up close to him i think he got ticked off thats part of the game

6466722 in china human rabies was largely under control during the years 1990 1996 via nation wide rabies vaccination programs since the end of the century however cases of human rabies have jumped high enough to trigger a warning sign for control and prevention
6466723 the use of human and equine rabies immunoglobulins hrig erig has saved the lives of countless patients who would have died if treated with vaccine alone however both products are often in short supply worldwide and are virtually unaffordable in developing countries

6466740 the idea of creating tag clouds is not new or unique but the wordle application offers those in schools with a uniquely visual way to view and or analyse some text it is very simple to use and the results are created quickly the style can be changed easily if required and easily saved we used this aspect in the library this week when we made a wordle using a number of lists of banned books the authors the titles and types of books were entered into the text box overwhelmingly the word novel stood out a second wordle on banned authors had william shakespeare and george orwell as the standouts this could form part of a greater discussion about the reason for this and we intend to give the issues of banned books and censorship a wider focus at a later date perhaps as part of social justice week run at our school each year we are also using wordles as the basis for one of the competitions for book week we created wordles of synopses of various well known books taking out any references too unique to the book and printed out copies one of the library staff members had fun playing with the colours and formats we did one for bryan strauchan my story and made it black and white bryan strauchan is a fictional character who plays for a football team that happens to have team colours of black and white another book involving animals was done making the wordle resemble tiger stripes the wordles look great laminated and i will also be putting up digital versions on the library website
6466741 itll be like his welcome back meet a little might montreal 2005
6466742 he will definitely be swimming backstroke and hes going to branch out into the sprint events as well youll see him do breaststroke but not at this olympic sort of level in national events
6466743 in the 1 50s and if he takes a shot at it on its own beyond the multi event programme it could be 1 49
6466744 when he did his breaststroke to freestyle turn he did no dolphin kicks so there was a flaw there it could have been better if he did the dolphin kicks he would have been another body length ahead
6466745 at the melbourne world cup in 2003 i stepped on his goggles deliberately he said hey someone stepped on my goggles i said oh well youre just gonna have to go without them
6466746 i saw them sitting in our team area i could have taken the goggles to him but i decided to keep them and see what he could do
6466747 so he swam and won the race without the goggles just like he did here in beijing in the 200 butterfly when his goggles filled with water
6466748 ive always tried to find ways to give him adversity in either meets or practice and have him overcome it
6466749 that way there was no dinner he had to deal with it
6466750 hes used to handling pressure situations in training where that pressure comes from me
6466751 we have often put him in a situation where practice is not over until he achieves a certain time things have to be done absolutely correctly or we do them over
6466752 i was at the ais when bill was there training a squad of juniors after one session they all complained that the water in the water fountain was too hot so the next day there was no water fountain
6466753 he was so fast he had to swim with older swimmers but by the end of the practice and at the most difficult part of the session i saw a little cap moving up forward to the front of the line with each repeat swim it was so remarkable id never seen anything like it and when i went home that night i couldnt sleep i was so excited but of course i didnt tell him that
6466754 i said you should be very tired thats the hardest practice youve ever done
6466755 ill never forget he looked me straight in the eye and said i dont get tired so i made that my life goal to see if i could accomplish that
6466756 he would race three times in the morning three in the afternoon and then id say to him thats not quite right you could go again every time he got out and said im tired i said no no look lets just try that again go on now and every time hed get back in and go again
6466757 he was just 11 but six months later he swam those exact times to the one hundredth of a second
6466758 i dont know how thats possible but its true he always had a very good sense of finding where he wants to go and how to go there
6466759 if you were watching the 100m butterfly final the serbian swimmer and michael were facing each other standing behind the blocks and it looked like they were trying to stare each other down after the race i asked michael if that was what he was doing and he said i didnt even know he was there thats how focused michael is on what he wants to do
6466760 i had to talk him through that he was really tired at that point i wasnt sure how it was going to go
6466761 the biggest moment of relief for me was after the 100m butterfly final id myself convinced that seven was the number it wasnt until the last 15m butterfly that i thought maybe it eight would happen one thing michael does better than anyone else is to use the right amount of emotional energy for every race he stands up for
6466762 they know that without the swimming theres no more money thats the key to michaels success
6466763 it would be nice to have michael retire on top its important to me that he doesnt peter out

6466922 given that ivins cannot stand trial putting the data through the rigorous process of scientific review may be the best available alternative
6466923 one is looking they can switch back to the original theme
6466924 i received my phd in 2002 for my work constructing mathematical models of hiv infection a field of study i entered in 1996
6466925 my work as a mathematical biologist has been built in large part on the paradigm that hiv causes aids and i have since come to realize that there is good evidence that the entire basis for this theory is wrong aids it seems is not a disease so much as a sociopolitical construct that few people understand and even fewer question
6466926 why have we as a society been so quick to accept a theory for which so little solid evidence exists why do we take proclamations by government institutions like the nih and the cdc via newscasters and talk show hosts entirely on faith the average citizen has no idea how weak the connection really is between hiv and aids and this is the manner in which scientifically insupportable phrases like the aids virus or an aids test have become part of the common vernacular despite no evidence for their accuracy
6466927 over the past ten years my attitude toward hiv and aids has undergone a dramatic shift this shift was catalyzed by the work i did as a graduate student analyzing mathematical models of hiv and the immune system as a mathematician i found virtually every model i studied to be unrealistic the biological assumptions on which the models were based varied from author to author and this made no sense to me
6466928 enough is enough and i can no longer in any capacity continue to support the paradigm on which my entire career has been built
6466929 but few people know that the criteria for a positive wb western blot hiv test vary from country to country and even from lab to lab put bluntly a persons hiv status could well change depending on the testing venue it is also possible to test wb indeterminate which translates to any one of uninfected possibly infected or even absurdly partly infected under the current interpretation this conundrum is confounded by the fact that the proteins comprising the different reactive bands on the wb test are all claimed to be specific to hiv raising the question of how a truly uninfected individual could possess antibodies to even one hiv specific protein
6466930 i have come to sincerely believe that these hiv tests do immeasurably more harm than good due to their astounding lack of specificity and standardization i cannot buy the idea that any individual needs to have a diagnostic hiv test a negative test may not be accurate whatever that means but a positive one can create utter havoc and destruction in a persons life all for a virus that most likely does absolutely nothing i do not feel it is going too far to say that these tests ought to be banned for diagnostic purposes
6466931 the real victims in this mess are those whose lives are turned upside down by the stigma of an hiv diagnosis people have lost their jobs been denied entry into the armed forces been refused residency in and even entry into some countries even been charged with assault or murder for having consensual sex babies have been taken from their mothers and had toxic medications forced down their throats there is no precedent for this type of behavior as it is all in the name of a completely unproven fundamentally flawed hypothesis on the basis of highly suspect indirect tests for supposed infection with an allegedly deadly virus a virus that has never been observed to do much of anything
6466932 suffice it to say that the hiv hypothesis of aids has offered nothing but predictions of its spread of the availability of a vaccine of a forthcoming animal model and so on that have not materialized and it has not saved a single life
6466933 after ten years involved in the academic side of hiv research as well as in the academic world at large i truly believe that the blame for the universal unconditional faith based acceptance of such a flawed theory falls squarely on the shoulders of those among us who have actively endorsed a completely unproven hypothesis in the interests of furthering our careers
6466934 for over twenty years the general public has been greatly misled and ill informed as someone who has been raised by parents who taught me from a young age never to believe anything just because everyone else accepts it to be true i can no longer just sit by and do nothing thereby contributing to this craziness and the craziness has gone on long enough as humans as honest academics and scientists the only thing we can do is allow the truth to come to light
6466935 our results have improved year on year we have had a lot of additional investment which has allowed us to recruit more teachers teaching assistants and technicians
6466936 ofsted have told us we are a good school and we support many youngsters who dont have english as a first language so to have the government categorise us as under performing is very unhelpful and unfair

6467038 der faymann ist ein sympathischer kompetenter junger mann mit handschlagqualit t wir vom kinderl cheln kennen ihn pers nlich sehr gut und wissen auch seine hilfsbereitschaft und soziale ader zu sch tzen aber in dieser schuldenpartei der machtgierigen roten bonzen gewerkschaftern ich sag nur bawag und einer dauernd sudernden basis gibt es keine zukunft in der unsere kinder was zu l cheln haben selbst wenn faymann superman w re h tte er diesen sauhaufen nicht im griff schade um solche leute wie den werner

6467101 my suspicion is that doubt about animal emotions is espoused not because it serves science but because it protects the emotional needs of the scientist

6467145 few people in the history of the national football league have played the game as well as gene and then had another career in football with so much positive impact on the structure and competitiveness of the entire league as gene

6467147 gene continually served in the best interests of the game of football

6467184 im thinking wow disc replacement is the best thing since sliced bread
6467185 having that surgery was the worst decision of my life
6467186 most physicians in the united states have financial relationships with industry ranging from the acceptance of meals to the receipt of large sums of money for consulting speaking or conducting research
6467187 consumers should absolutely know where their doctor is coming from
6467188 doctors think they wont be influenced by these financial relationships but the research shows that they are
6467189 lets say your investment counselor went on a trip to aruba paid for by a certain company
6467190 then he comes home and recommends you invest in that company wouldnt you be concerned
6467191 look around for hints that your doctor sees a lot of drug reps
6467192 and if you see an extremely attractive impeccably dressed polite person with a briefcase in the waiting room watch out thats most likely a drug rep
6467193 ask the doctor whats the scientific evidence for prescribing that particular drug over another one they must have a scientific reason especially if its a high price brand name drug instead of a generic
6467194 there are circumstances where you want to take this extra step and there are other times where you really dont want to bother
6467195 the first priority of physicians is the health and well being of our patients
6467196 when youre poor it can be hard to pay the bills when youre rich its hard to keep track of all the bills that need paying
6467197 im for clean energy i just dont ever vote for it
6467198 there is no pride to be had in such efforts
6467199 well um we didnt know where we were going so we were walking in circles
6467200 mom mom please tell daddy we were on our way home please
6467201 son you cant just find a house you have to pay for it

6467206 well sis will you help me if i help you
6467207 i hope this can be the time when we can make a real change
6467208 we need to improve healthcare in this country because its holding us back and i hope the convention will be an opportunity to begin putting that right
6467209 we will be staying in the marriott for the week and i wont tell you how much that will cost
6467210 i would be shocked if he remembered who i was but thats not important
6467211 conservatives were supposed to be the bigger problem for mccain obama still has work to do on his base at this point mccain seems to be doing a better job with his
6467212 i think people will see that im not afraid to have folks around me who complement my strengths and who are independent im not a believer in a government of yes men i think one of the failures of the early bush administration was being surrounded by people who were unwilling to deliver bad news or who were prone to simply feed the president information that confirmed his own preconceptions
6467213 the only person whos asking about my assets my liabilities the way im spending my money where that money is coming from primarily is my wife and theres nothing i can do about that all i know is what i read in the newspapers
6467214 read anything into it with regard to springfield obama will be traveling to battleground states
6467215 i m just glad i ve finally scored again the visibly relieved player told
6467216 i can t remember the last time i scored for the national team it s indescribable bajramaj beamed
6467217 we were totally unfocused in the first half and they put us under a lot of pressure but we looked like we wanted to win in the second half we wanted the bronze the wide midfielder said after all but single handedly winning the match for the germans
6467218 something was missing and we ourselves don t know what it was we ll work it out later we lacked goals and freshness and we were nowhere near as ruthless as last year said bajramaj
6467219 obviously my next target is to secure a regular starting place and i ll get there in due course she says with confidence
6467220 oh yeah thats the book all those bloggers were talking about
6467221 for the purpose of this feature we decided to interview martijn by committee to give him not only the chance to write about aspects of his work that interested him most but also the choice not to write about other aspects which although no where near as interesting as what he has to say is interesting in itself
6467222 mitch daniels got pharmaceutical companies to pay for prescriptions for hoosiers in need through rx for indiana
6467223 governor daniels he went to phrma got his foot in the door
6467224 he would not stop until this program helped each and every person
6467225 if people keep saying it it will be a disadvantage
6467226 the governor was relieved when i told him that carter and brown did very very well in many of those counties
6467227 i feel that obamas campaign is reaching out to the clinton supporters and that it is very organized here in indiana i hear comments from clinton supporters daily on their commitment to senator obama these folks were very passionate about their candidate in the primary but realize that they do not want this country to continue down the same path as the bush administration has taken this country and have begun to align themselves with the obama campaign i see this trend growing daily here in southern indiana the obama campaign has a very large grass roots organization on the ground here in southern indiana and should do well down here
6467228 he carries it because hes got staff in these areas as well as 4 a gallon gas recession and war the obama folks have an unbelievable work ethic ive attended meetings all over southwestern indiana that theyve held theyre here to win not for show
6467229 the energetic level with which the obama campaign staffers and volunteers many of whom were clinton volunteers are working the campaign will reap dividends for senator obama this fall in our area the ultimate question becomes whether those democratic voters who are not activists will turn out in traditional numbers remains unanswered at this point the feedback from the voter on the street is that the obama campaign publicity and advertisements are succeeding in raising the familiarity of senator obama in this area the biggest concern of most democratic voters who were on the fence was a general unfamiliarity with him time will help this the abysmal record of the bush administration and the sorry state of our economy is going to cause many of the formerly one issue voters to rethink their positions on some traditional republican issues this of course helps in our area
6467230 i believe that race will probably be a consideration for hopefully only a small number of voters
6467231 these voters we cannot get we must simply pray for them and move on race will play a far smaller role than some believe
6467232 if senator bayh is selected it is a new ball game in indiana evan is very popular with the voters in this area his choice would truly be the tide that raises all the blue boats indiana would be a blue state this fall
6467233 these results provide further evidence that canadians are marinating in this chemical on a daily basis
6467234 there was no mention of plastic or bisphenol a on the label
6467235 thank you for sharing your concerns regarding bisphenol a in can linings we are aware of the controversy surrounding this issue and have conversed with both our can manufacturer and the national food processors association of which we are a member on the use of bisphenol a muir glen will continue to monitor this situation through both our can manufacturer and the nfpa if you have any further questions please feel free to telephone us at 1 800 832 6345 sincerely susan leonard
6467236 it did mention bisphenol a and even included a printout sheet titled
6467237 most scientific authorities agree that there is no need for public health concern about cans lined with epoxy coatings to help preserve their contents t he topic of estrogen hormone mimickers is a new and open scientific question upon which there is little consensus the nfpa has conducted independent research on the migration of bisphenol a from metal food containers into various foods and beverages and they believe the fda will conclude that any potential migration of these substances would have no health significance
6467238 there is no row they will honor the trai directive
6467239 to come to a decision like that weve taken a lot of things into consideration last year how we finished the season otas training camp preseason games

6467247 russia has informed us through military channels that the minister of defence of the russian federation has taken a decision to halt international military cooperation events between russia and nato countries until further instructions
6467248 as far as nato and isaf natos international security assistance force isaf are concerned the allegations in le monde are completely unfounded
6467249 we deny the report we have no information whatsoever that would indicate that the french soldiers were killed by nato planes
6467250 none of the wounds sustained by those killed or wounded were consistent with air delivered ordnance
6467251 if they had engaged there might have been considerable collateral damage if bombs had been used
6467252 no french soldier at any time during the incident came on the radio to say that they were taking friendly fire and no french soldier after the event has mentioned to the chain of command that this might have been the case
6467253 there was fire from machine guns on american planes that were guided by american special forces and we have no information that enables us to consider that the french soldiers were killed under fire from nato planes
6467254 fifteen to 20 minutes after the engagement of our forces a support section left the base camp and took around 40 to 50 minutes to get to the scene
6467255 nowhere did the american people make it more clear that we need a new direction than in the war in iraq
6467256 i think its pretty clear you have to have a president to want the war to end in order for the war to end
6467257 and so if you really want to get out of iraq you have to have a democratic president because john mccain has basically adopted george bushs policies on both iraq and the economy
6467258 just because you can talk and do your work at the same time doesnt mean everyone else can
6467259 marcus is never going to be the same he wont be able to make jokes anymore because josh wont be there

6467265 old people are a really good source of prescription medicine
6467266 the world needs this peace and musicians can make these kind of statements they can also be a very good example for many politicians the people who are responsible peace is exactly what everyone believes in if we think of tomorrow or the day after tomorrow or especially if we think of our children
6467267 one thing i do know when a thousand or 12 hundred people are killed many of them peacefully asleep in their beds the world cannot shut its eyes to the fact
6467268 shostakovitchs seventh is a really symbolic piece to bring people some hope and the tchaikovsky is for many people in the world especially in russia maybe a sort of farewell piece its about death its the last symphony of tchaikovsky and everybody knows this slow movement and it has some religious power maybe for these people to bring people together when they are suffering
6467269 he is a great musician and of course with all his connections he will bring people together i think thats his main goal but his first reaction is very emotional because he grew up in this region gergiev is speaking with his wife and children ossetian and not russian so its very close for him emotionally and i think its maybe for him very important to create some bridges and to be an ambassador for empathy
6467270 a blog that just like a poison has a mysterious seductive power amp to which its symbolizes poets dreaminess

6467277 the 170 new jobs millennium plans to add in the coming years is great news but its the technology these new associates will manufacture that has the most far reaching impact
6467278 first of all it will bring 60 new jobs and pretty good quality jobs
6467279 were doing better but we are not where we want to be yet
6467280 i am very very puzzled as to why all of the documents were not presented to the jury nor the court by the defense
6467281 we certainly will be challenging these findings on a number of grounds both procedural and substantive
6467282 the fact that the judge refused to acknowledge his own responsibility in these matters reveals a great deal
6467283 heres the true story of harold l scotts selection as mayor of kokomo
6467284 this is more devastating news for indianas working families and it further illustrates the need for a new direction and new leadership in this state
6467285 month after month indiana continues to lose good paying jobs while this administration does little if anything to stop it i firmly believe that with the right leadership and right priorities we can turn this economy around i am running for governor because i want to work to rebuild this economy and make indiana more competitive by overhauling our tax structure reforming our health care and education systems and working to bring economic opportunity and good paying jobs back to every indiana community
6467286 weve still got the lowest jobless rate in the midwest
6467287 change is difficult sometimes you can tell in advance when change is going to be contentious when they disturb a very deeply invested special interest others can surprise you i dont think of roads and jobs and hope for our economic future is partisan at all
6467288 your vote for the major moves roads and jobs plan was undeniably one of those rare events
6467289 few people in the history of the national football league have played the game as well as gene and then had another career in football with so much positive impact on the structure and competitiveness of the entire league as gene
6467290 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6467291 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6467292 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6467293 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children i didnt know gene personally i just knew him professionally
6467294 im not going to sell the players on a cap again
6467295 once we go through the cap why should we agree to it again
6467296 gene and i developed a close friendship that remained strong through the good times and some of the nfls most difficult challenges
6467297 we worked very closely on key issues that allowed the nfl to maintain unprecedented labor peace his biggest asset was his understanding of the business of the game and you always knew that his concern for the games best interests guided his actions
6467298 gene was a true pioneer as one of the few african american leaders of a major union
6467299 he was the equal of owners in negotiations and made the league a better place for all players playing alongside of gene was an honor and a privilege he was a pillar of strength and leadership for our great raider teams

6467333 if there is in fact a silver lining to this it is that people are paying more attention to open standards
6467334 multiple national standards may be appropriate in areas such as building and clothes where local geographic and climatic conditions make unique international standards less useful as a general rule the objective at the international level is to have one globally relevant standard it can sometimes happen especially in fast moving areas such as it that broadly similar standards but focused on different functionalities may each engage the interest of market segments in such cases multiple standards can exist and it is the market that eventually decides which will survive

6467338 we required a platform that would allow us to design our unique processes into the central erp solution without spending an arm and a leg microsoft dynamics ax provides the ability to write new user interfaces and database hooks using the ms net framework a very popular programming language
6467339 user participation is a major hurdle when implementing an enterprise wide application but after a power user demonstration you almost instantly gain support
6467340 im confident flexitech inc has selected the right package to not only support todays requirements but also to maintain a level of flexibility with a truly dynamic erp
6467341 selecting an erp solution is only half of the battle choosing a partner who can fully understand the business needs and deliver the erp technology is the other half flexitech inc is excited to work together with sunrise technologies on our new ms dynamics ax implementation
6467342 from the very beginning during our initial online product demonstration it was apparent that sunrise had an in depth understanding of microsoft dynamics axs capabilities
6467343 their sunrise manufacturing and distribution experience along with their knowledge of a new object oriented erp solution challenged flexitechs old mainframe ways

6467347 i went to soar with absolutely no idea what i wanted to major in i had so many interests and the fig topic sparked my interest and made things more convenient during registration
6467348 we often discover that students figs led them into their current major and that they thoroughly enjoyed courses they otherwise wouldnt have thought about
6467349 i usually tell students about my experience which was phenomenal and how it actually shaped my major i have today
6467350 its an incredible advantage to work with a small group of students at a school thats so massive we easily organized study groups and discovered that across the board we generally did better on exams than non fig sections
6467351 i felt like i got so much more out of the course material than my classmates who werent in figs
6467352 our diversity is consistently higher twenty five percent of our fig students are students of color compared to about 13 percent of the entire freshmen class
6467353 the program is designed to create a beneficial experience for students but faculty members say its changed the way they view freshmen and the way they teach
6467354 its the most rewarding teaching experience ive had at this university
6467355 the close personal working relationship with the students makes it very easy to generate discussion and first semester freshmen have a natural enthusiasm when beginning college
6467356 i can count on my students having read certain plays by shakespeare or tragedies by sophocles and i can expect them to bring those to our discussion
6467357 when your friends think smile they think of you there is not a day that goes by that you cant find something good about the world and your fellow human

6467363 we are trying to help them develop jewish identities and to show them that the arts are just another way to embrace their judaism
6467364 i learned a lot more about myself and whats important to me
6467365 as important if not more than any of our other programs
6467366 i felt like i was also a friend as well as a mentor
6467367 the program for me was more about the mentor mentee relationship
6467368 its so moving and worthwhile that i cant help but feel good about it
6467369 this is something thats blossomed from two students into a much larger program
6467370 what i found here was such informality and really good people
6467371 ready to do something more serious and explore things in an academic sense as opposed to a continuing education sense
6467372 everybody has to be on it multiple times during the week and its like a bulletin board the professor poses certain questions and the students and professor discuss those questions theres a class discussion and there can be 50 to 200 postings throughout the week but you dont ever have to be online at any particular time
6467373 i was going to take a course at columbia to get a masters degree in jewish studies but i cant be going to columbia twice a week

6467375 i think a lot of seniors dont really think to themselves im going to go take a formal class
6467376 i dont know the degree to which they thought about formal post high school education years ago so for a lot of them i think learning starts in smaller chunks and then grows to more
6467377 a lot of these people may well have been blue collar workers who werent exposed to those things during their lives and didnt really have time to explore them
6467378 once you allow people to explore some really take off from there and some people are just satisfied in a limited dabbling of them
6467379 their friends are here they can take a variety of classes have lunch here and then in the afternoon we have social clubs
6467380 for a lot of people this is the place to come its like family
6467381 i dont drive so im limited but if im going to the jcc on monday tuesday wednesday and thursday friday is a day i need off

6467389 a nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death
6467390 that starts with tougher sanctions and aggressive principled and direct high level diplomacy without preconditions
6467391 by going the extra diplomatic mile while keeping all options on the table we make it more likely the rest of the world will stand with us to increase pressure on iran if diplomacy is failing

6467408 this is not a water crisis its a political crisis
6467409 this will stabilize the water situation in the medium and long term

6467564 this refreshed presentation is just the first stage of a number of releases planned over the next twelve months
6467565 you can go from the bottom to the top of the track and with the old surface you just couldnt do that
6467566 if you got hung on the outside you were stuck and if you tried to force your way back into line thats when trouble would typically start i dont know what its like to watch but from where i sit racing at bristol is pretty fun now
6467567 you can run all over the race track which is whats so fun about it you can race guys arent running over each other to pass each other
6467568 the new surface provides a little bit more exciting opportunities to pass whether its a restart or a long tire run
6467569 you can get up into the outside groove or go in high and come across the middle and go low easier you can change your line around and then of course the new car hereditarily is tight
6467570 so its very difficult to get the car to turn but you struggle with that all the time you have to adjust and change your line and with the five wins i have had there it has been different every time whether it was flat out speed or a little bit of strategy every time you have to adjust to the changing circumstances
6467571 since bristol has been repaved the racing is not the same but they did a nice job of redoing it
6467572 for the fans i know its not the racing that theyre used to but for the drivers the new track is a lot of fun to drive
6467573 its stressful when you are racing for points it makes it tough
6467574 on the other hand its a lot of fun its very physical and very competitive it is an emotionally draining race as well as being physically draining add comment

6467581 with inflation more than twice the bank of englands target people in debt are particularly worried about stretching their household budget further and further especially when talk of an economic slowdown is threatening to reduce many consumers income levels as well
6467582 in recent years the easy availability of credit has led many people to turn to debt consolidation loans as a way of reducing both their monthly debt repayments and the complexity of their finances so the bank of englands q2 2008 credit conditions survey makes disturbing reading
6467583 the survey shows that the availability of secured credit for example was down around 45 in q2 with lenders tightening credit scoring criteria and decreasing maximum ltv loan to value ratios although its a significant reduction it does not mean credit is unavailable as long as they have sufficient equity in their home and as long as they approach a lender who specialises in helping people in their situation many people still stand an excellent chance of obtaining a secured debt consolidation loan
6467584 when someone joins a debt management plan they essentially ask debt specialists to renegotiate their repayment terms this can bring their monthly debt repayments down to an affordable level freeing up the funds they need to cope with the rising cost of living
6467585 in an iva the individual agrees to make fixed monthly payments based on what they can afford after essential living expenses for the duration of the iva normally five years if 75 of the creditors by debt value consent to the terms of the iva theyll agree not to take any legal action against the individual and to write off any remaining debt once the iva has successfully concluded
6467586 in the vast majority of cases debt problems only get worse when theyre ignored the important thing is to seek professional debt advice as soon as you realise you have a potential problem

6467648 dif cil denominarlo urbano es un semi permanente normal y corriente pero con las vallas pegadas en las rectas es el polo opuesto a m naco
6467649 diferente a m naco o a lo que ser singapur
6467650 hay tramos ciegos pero en teor a las banderas amarillas tendr an que ayudar en caso de que en una curva que no pudieras ver a la salida si hay alguien parado
6467651 del mismo modo continu hay partes que se estrechan bastante como la zona del puente pero son los riesgos y trampas que tiene todo circuito urbano m naco no permite ning n error y valencia pese a ser m s ancho menos bacheado y estar todo m s calculado no va a permitir tampoco errores esa es la salsa de los circuitos urbano
6467652 a trescientos kil metros por hora va a cambiar mucho respecto a las sensaciones al caminarlo hoy se va a volver todo m s estrecho y m s dif cil pero as a priori es de esos circuitos que te gustan bien preparado todo calculado a estrenar todo nuevo
6467653 de hecho prosigui hay curvas que ahora piensas que son de una manera y luego te subes al coche y algunas partes no tienen nada que ver con lo que hab as programado cuando te subas seguro que hay sorpresas pero lo m s importante es aprovechar las tres horas que tendremos de entrenamiento para dar el mayor n mero de vueltas para tener m s confianza
6467654 est claro que espa a est al frente de automovilismo y otros deportes
6467655 ver a tanta gente en los entrenamientos es una sensaci n incre ble buena para la f 1 dos grandes premios en espa a es una justa recompensa por lo que se ha volcado espa a con este deporte

6467660 its always good to have an opportunity to compete especially for a team thats going to be competing for a big east and a national championship
6467661 its nice to come out and have a competition where were going to push each other
6467662 when that second week came around i got my chance
6467663 i feel like im doing pretty good i still have some stuff to work on but im starting to feel more comfortable in there my biggest thing right now is my footwork is lagging behind my arm right now if i can get my footwork done itll help my passing more also being able to get out of the pocket and scramble a little bit that helps too
6467664 itd definitely be a dream come true to lead a team like this in a game like that
6467665 i can get it out a little bit at tight end you get mad it doesnt matter because theyre not going to call your number the only thing you can do is catch the ball and try to run somebody over but how much is that really worth it but at defensive end and that happens during the emotion of the game you can do it every play take out that tackle and try to get to the quarterback take it out on a running back its an awesome feeling

6467674 now think about that i guess if you think that being rich means you gotta make five million dollars and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6467675 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you were like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so that they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6467676 todo el mundo vio lo dif cil que es esta prueba
6467677 todo el mundo se dio cuenta de que es una competencia muy dif cil y de que el hecho de que no hayamos conseguido una medalla no quiere decir que no se pueda conseguir
6467678 lo he conseguido he podido superar la presi n de estos mis primeros juegos ol mpicos una presi n a la que yo no estaba acostumbrada
6467679 entrenando porque es lo que amo y ojal dios no me rompa nada y me permita seguir de una pieza
6467680 es un salto al que nunca me he acomodado as que lo vamos a cambiar pero bueno hab amos trabajado con esta lista durante mucho tiempo y a n as estoy muy contenta por los tres ltimos saltos

6467683 estamos muy complacidos en los dos ltimos a os no ha estado a la altura de nuestras expectativas
6467684 por el momento hemos tenido una jornada soleada esperemos que se mantenga el mismo tiempo durante el fin de semana para que podamos disfrutar de este fant stico circuito la organizaci n me parece estupenda y se respira una gran atm sfera
6467685 el equipo est trabajando estupendamente hemos desarrollado el coche muy bien y espero que podamos seguir con los buenos resultados
6467686 en estos momentos somos extremadamente competitivos y esperamos finalizar las pr ximas carreras siempre entre los diez primeros para nosotros es fundamental seguir luchando por mantener la cuarta plaza en el mundial de constructores ser complicado mantenerla frente a renault y red bull
6467687 todo est muy bien preparado pero tengo mi hotel a cinco minutos andando del circuito y los polic as se empe an en mandarme hacia barcelona espero que el domingo tarde s lo veinte minutos en llegar
6467688 esperamos que funcione bien estamos trabajando muy duro con las herramientas que ahora mismo tenemos en las manos hemos optimizado al m ximo el material disponible y vamos a luchar por entrar en los puntos
6467689 estoy hablando con honda pero tambi n con otros equipos yo dej ferrari porque no ten a libertad para hacer lo que quer a estoy esperando esa oportunidad
6467690 creo que se han hecho bien las cosas tenemos que ser conscientes de las particularidades del trazado y del sitio limitado todo me parece correcto aunque el puente ser un sitio complicado y si se produce un accidente inevitablemente habr que parar la carrera

6467694 no fue precisamente m s que colombia en juego pero ecuador se impuso con un penalti a su rival en el partido amistoso de preparaci n para las eliminatorias que se disput ayer en nueva jersey estados unidos
6467695 con un rendimiento que deja dudas para los pr ximos encuentros eliminatorios ecuador se impuso 1 0 ante su similar de colombia en un cotejo amistoso jugado este mi rcoles en nueva jersey previo a los cotejos que sostendr con bolivia en quito y uruguay en montevideo
6467696 la selecci n ecuatoriana se impuso anoche por 0 1 con gol de christian ben tez ante su similar de colombia en el partido amistoso disputado en el estadio de los gigantes de nueva jersey estados unidos y que dej ver a una colombia a la que le cuesta mucho trabajo marcar goles
6467697 si antes del encuentro amistoso de ayer frente a colombia el t cnico sixto vizuete ten a dudas en lo que ser el once inicial de la s ptima y octava fecha de las eliminatorias sudamericanas hoy esas interrogantes aumentaron
6467698 a ver si se puede intentar que todos los pilotos nos podamos juntar en el pit lane antes de salir ma ana a los entrenamientos y guardar un minuto de silencio creo que es lo m nimo que podemos hacer pero no depende ni de m ni de los pilotos estas cosas se mueven por otros sitios
6467699 en la vida hay cosas m s importantes que el deporte
6467700 producto de su buen trabajo se generaron opciones claras de abrir el marcador pero al final no tuvieron xito
6467701 la selecci n nacional no logr dominar con claridad salvo en espor dicos tramos ni cuando platin decidi juntar en la mitad de la cancha a talentosos como escobar campos y saucedo tr o del que s lo el paraguayo supo salir a flote
6467702 lo cual impidi que se abra el marcador hasta el gol de cabrera
6467703 mostr poco espect culo futbol stico pero debe renovar la confianza de su pa s en la reanudaci n de las eliminatorias del mundial
6467704 la verde tuvo imprecisiones pero el acoso permanente al arco rival rindi sus frutos pasada la media hora del segundo tiempo cuando diego cabrera marc el nico gol
6467705 el objetivo era estar en la final disfrutar y lo he hecho
6467706 se esperaba que las medallas estuvieran por debajo de 13 20 y as ha sido
6467707 hasta que no estemos en esos registros antes de venir aqu
6467708 no podemos comenzar a pensar en eso muchos grandes corredores se han quedado en el camino y me siento muy satisfecho de haber llegado a ella
6467709 nos pueden decir de todo pero que no se nos tilde de poco luchadores porque todos lo hemos sido
6467710 felizmente ayer en la tarde a la vuelta del partido turqu a chile el presidente mayne nicholls recibi un correo de la federaci n espa ola que confirmaba que en septiembre se iban a ver todos los detalles
6467711 fue una l stima lo que le pas a liu porque yo quer a dar espect culo
6467712 espero que liu siga adelante y que no se rinda porque tiene mucho futuro por delante
6467713 en esta prueba se han visto muchos casos que han ido a tremenda velocidad y han chocado con la ltima valla

6467719 ser cuarto en unos jjoo no es lo peor me voy con muy buena experiencia lo pele simplemente no se pudo dar
6467720 seguramente en los pr ximos jjoo londres 2012 me va a ir mejor
6467721 todav a falta gente que va a competir y en el taekwondo siempre hay buenos resultados
6467722 el circuito de valencia es una mezcla entre los de m naco y bahrein
6467723 es un trazado impresionante muy diferente a los dem s ser emocionante porque no estamos acostumbrados a l se parece al de m naco por ser urbano pero tambi n tiene rectas estupendas como el de bahrein por poner un ejemplo me gusta mucho la ciudad y estoy seguro de que la gente se divertir el domingo
6467724 pero seguro que a partir de ma ana estar todo bien
6467725 tengo que mirar hacia adelante estuve cerca de ganar la ltima carrera pero ahora lo m s importante es volver a ser competitivo desde la clasificaci n hasta el final de la carrera tengo un coche fant stico tenemos buena velocidad punta y pienso que reunimos todas las condiciones para estar arriba de nuevo aunque el objetivo principal es ser consistentes
6467726 dentro del coche todo cambia la velocidad lo condiciona todo pero tambi n el grip adherencia del asfalto si es bueno habr menos problemas
6467727 spero che nella nostra chiesa ogni persona gay lesbica bisessuale e transessuale si dichiari come tale perch questo il modo in cui la nostra chiesa andr incontro a un vero cambiamento
6467728 la chiesa ignora lesperienza delle persone omosessuali come una volta rifiutava di ascoltare gli eterosessuali in materia di sesso e matrimonio
6467729 lincontro ha raggiunto unalta intensit emotiva il secondo giorno quando un vescovo ha esortato tutti i gay e le lesbiche cattolici inclusi vescovi e sacerdoti a dichiararsi e di far sapere alla chiesa ci che hanno da dire sulla loro esperienza sessuale
6467730 la tensione si anche avvertita fra i genitori cattolici che vogliono accoglienza per i loro ragazzi gay e lesbiche allinterno della chiesa
6467731 questo linsegnamento del santo padre che ci dice che marito e moglie non dovrebbero provare piacere nellintimit perch questo peccato
6467732 giovanni paolo ii rifiuta lasfissiante visione dellatto sessuale che fu propria della tradizione cristiana per oltre un millenio
6467733 abbiamo finalmente ascoltato le persone sposate e la loro esperienza era che la gioia e il piacere del sesso sono un bene dato da dio di cui appunto bisogna gioire e alla fine la chiesa stata capace di ascoltare ci che la gente andava dicendo
6467734 e io suggerisco che la stessa cosa debba venire quando gli omosessuali condividono con noi le loro esperienze la loro sensazione che la loro sessualit sia un dono
6467735 io penso sia molto importante che loro avvertano calore e apertura nella chiesa che sia consentito loro di condividere i loro doni con la nostra chiesa
6467736 il dono del coraggio che cos meraviglioso il dono della compassione e del prendersi cura degli altri il dono della creativit che sembra essere cos accentuato nella comunit omosessuale
6467737 non so dire il numero di lettere che ricevo da preti che dicono di essere gay ma che sono spaventati dal dichiarasi
6467738 che perdita che questa per la nostra chiesa se essi la domenica mattina di fronte alla comunit dicessero chi sono veramente la nostra chiesa potrebbe meglio apprezzare i doni che gli omosessuali possono portare alla comunit sia nella chiesa sia nella societ
6467739 il numero di uomini e donne che hanno tendenze omosessuali profondamente radicate non trascurabile essi non scelgono la loro condizione omosessuale
6467740 sebbene questo principio non metta le cause dellomosessualit sotto il controllo degli interessati la chiesa insiste che lattivit sessuale fra persone dello stesso sesso sia peccaminosa
6467741 per molti gay lesbiche e altri queste posizioni non sono conciliabili e malgrado il sonoro appello dei vescovi al rispetto della dignit degli omosessuali in ogni ambito della conferenza i partecipanti hanno parlato della paura di dichiararsi come tali
6467742 egli ha detto alla gente incluso il parroco i colleghi e alcuni parrocchiani quando credono che linformazione potrebbe essere utile lui grato agli incontri come questo simposio
6467743 una visione meravigliosa la giusta cosa da dire a un gruppo come questo
6467744 studi scientifici recenti mettono lattenzione su basi biologiche pi che su basi psicologiche ha detto e mette in guardia dal tentare di cambiare orientamento sessuale
6467745 ha detto notando che persone di altre chiese cristiane stanno affrontando questa stessa questione
6467746 non penso che ci siano pi genitori ostili fra i cattolici rispetto a qualsiasi altro gruppo sociale
6467747 in qualsiasi gruppo religioso la gente che ha una coscienza amer i figli quali che siano

6467758 al principio tuvimos algunos fallos y nos cost entrar en el partido tambi n en parte porque las chinas comenzaron a jugar muy bien con una gran defensa y un ataque muy efectivo
6467759 mantener la concentraci n en los peores momentos ha sido clave nos ha servido para aguantar a las chinas en el marcador y despu s para crecer como equipo a lo largo del partido y no pasar apuros en el tercer set
6467760 sabemos que son un gran equipo y la prueba es que hoy ganaron a cuba hasta con facilidad pero vamos a disfrutar unas horas de este gran triunfo y a partir de ma ana nos centraremos en ellas hoy toca ser feliz

6467811 im excited to win the silver medal im proud to present such a wonderful match in front of the large audience
6467812 i hope beach volleyball will have a faster development in china through our success at the beijing games
6467813 i am not surprised as i always said that china would do well here
6467814 i thought the usa would have the edge in terms of the total number of medals won but based on golds only i could see china doing well
6467815 this success will last as long as the sporting system lasts here
6467816 to be in the final re writes chinese hockey history
6467817 it is good to be in the final no asian team womens has ever won gold in the olympics on friday we will change the world history of hockey
6467818 the best ive been on are desert war exceed and excel shogun lodge and racing to win
6467819 they were all different but id have to say that racing to win probably has the edge
6467820 i rode him in an exhibition a couple of weeks ago and again last saturday morning and ive been quite surprised how forward he is
6467821 it took him the whole of last preparation to get his eye in again because he had been out for such a long time
6467822 im just trying to do the little things right because i think after that everything else takes care of itself
6467823 i dont think ive felt this enthusiastic about my riding for years im riding with confidence and really enjoying it
6467824 im assuming that as unemployment rises and inflation pressures subside australian financial conditions will need to be shifted from extremely restrictive to only mildly restrictive
6467825 if that is right the rba probably will be forced to return standard mortgage rates from 9 1 2 per cent today to 8 per cent
6467826 over the past two to three weeks there has been a substantial fall in the price of money in the australian marketplace
6467827 thats come about through the reserve indicating there is going to be an interest rate cut over the next few weeks
6467828 what were forecasting through to next year is that those sources of funds will continue to rise and continue to put upward pressure on the banks cost of funds
6467829 it was substantially above the reserves cash rate and its the banks cost of funds that determines the mortgage rate
6467830 mortgage rates are 9 per cent or more at present essentially because the rba is happy for them to be there
6467831 the pain and fatigue that you feel in the water is what i went through for a whole year to beat the cancer so i know what to expect
6467832 i am thrilled without their generous donations i might not be here
6467833 the leukemia has taught me to think step by step
6467834 when you are in hospital and feeling so much pain and feeling so tired you dont want to want to think about the next day or week you just think about the next hour it teaches you to be patient when you are lying in a hospital bed and that was almost the same strategy i chose here to wait for my chance in the pack
6467835 hes a great ambassador for swimming and a worthy champion his story is amazing and can inspire a lot of people it was a pleasure to race him what he has achieved is phenomenal
6467836 it was the most painful and difficult thing i have ever done
6467837 im not a member of the firm but perhaps i should be im far too nice i think i have to get a little rougher
6467838 id really like to swim in the serpentine in four years time he said
6467839 itll be a fantastic spectacle i hope by then ill be able to swim straight learn all the tactics and get some meat on me to bounce them all off

6467848 further evidence of the persisting problems with the 2006 nhs dental reforms
6467849 more than a million people have now lost access to nhs dental care those that are able to access care are confronted with a system that discourages modern preventive care by placing targets rather than patients at its heart
6467850 the government is in complete denial over the fact that the new dental contract has been an abject failure
6467851 people want to see an nhs dentist but all the evidence shows they are finding this increasingly difficult
6467852 i have been talking about this since the day i took over
6467853 it is inevitable it has come much slower than i would have thought it is accelerating now at a more rapid pace than i would have thought but it is happening now the lufthansa swissair alliance the klm airfrance deal ba in merger with iberia delta and northwest have announced talks
6467854 and in the coming years australians in general and the authorities in australia specifically are going to have to realise that as strong as qantas is and as big as it is that it will have to have some form of consolidation
6467855 that will need some new flexibilities some compromises made to ensure that qantas is part of whatever happens in this consolidation process
6467856 i will have moved on but a new level of maturity and understanding will be needed when this debate takes place as it inevitably will because airlines cannot continue on the way they are at the moment
6467857 it is the way the industry has been going and it is the way of the future the ones that consolidate will be the big survivors in the future
6467858 moodys has stated that an upgrade of our debt and deposit ratings would be considered should the proposed merger with westpac proceed and be completed in the time frame envisaged however should the merger not eventuate or not be completed in the time frame envisaged moodys has stated that there would be potential for downward pressure on our deposit and debt ratings and if an alternative bidder with lower ratings than us ultimately merger with us there would likely be downward pressure on all our ratings

6467863 some consumers were paying thousands of dollars to be added to someones account to get a short term increase in their credit rating
6467864 im thrilled with fair isaacs willingness to take a second look at this
6467865 when you have someone as an authorized user on a credit card you give them an escape route
6467866 if you lose your job or get into a horrible financial mess youre not dragging them down with you
6467867 when i went to college i was listed on my dads credit card as an authorized user but i was strictly told it could only be used for emergency purposes and not to buy a round of beer for everybody
6467868 when its done in a family environment where the practices of sound credit are taught its very beneficial
6467869 if youve been raised thinking you can do everything and
6467870 if you hate your job youre overwhelmed with work the
6467871 from a female point of view the problem with the self sacrifice model of marriage is that its usually the woman whos being asked to sacrifice
6467872 heres a newsflash for you jeremy not tracees jeremy may be wonderful but its not as if im sitting around with my feet up he performs a reasonable share of the labor generated by our home and children which i would argue are as much his responsibility as mine but i have almost always done more the sainted jeremy may look like husband of the year in comparison with a lot of other guys but that just goes to show how low we set the bar for men in this society
6467873 in one revealing study the found that male managers blood pressure and stress hormone levels dropped dramatically at five p m but the
6467874 first shift jobs to their second shift responsibilities as wives and mothers
6467875 operators have not yet found access pricing mechanisms that both make sense to users and effectively align user behaviors with the costs they impose
6467876 why should we pump money into it if all people do with it is illegal file sharing

6467886 usually we dont choose who we like or love as well as perfumes love just happens
6467887 but on the same day they did a story on my staff they didnt do a story about my speech at crain s where i rolled out i thought a thoughtful plan on how to preserve middle class jobs in new york city

6467889 they have to make the decisions on how they chose to cover these races

6467903 on landing glitter left the plane after being met by cathay pacific staff and an immigration official
6467904 he smiled as he was fast tracked through the diplomats and airline staff immigration point but once out of sight the smile must have been wiped off his face
6467905 we will have to expel him back to vietnam or britain or another country where he wants to go
6467906 i should never have been in there i was set up
6467907 the blasts were so big i thought i was going to die
6467908 i looked around and saw so many of my fellow workers dead or dying
6467909 i will never forget the scene i saw i could not believe i was alive
6467910 directed the authorities to make efforts to expose the hidden hands behind the incident
6467911 our bombers carried out todays attack it is in reaction to military operations in swat and bajaur
6467912 similar attacks will be carried out in other cities of pakistan including lahore islamabad and rawalpindi
6467913 wherever the governments writ is challenged we will take action
6467914 as baseball is seldom seen in china you cant expect local fans to know how to react when the charge song is played on the organ or how to come up with taunts calculated to torment the pitcher like we want a pitcher not a belly itcher
6467915 yelling defence or charge doesnt sound right in chinese so i want to think up a few suitable chinese slogans for future games
6467916 i shouted with the crowd from the first minute to the end of the first half part but i was so worn out in the second half that i decided to sit and watch rather than cheer our athletes
6467917 people just yelled randomly all i could hear were shouts of go china from all directions throughout
6467918 nessuno su questa terra pi felice di colui che trova il vero amore
6467919 nessuno su questa terra pi felice di colui che trova il vero amore
6467920 start at home or a hotel if theyre a special person
6467921 if my son billy joe has done something wrong then it is right and proper that the matter be investigated but how an alleged incident from months ago should surface now a day before three british boxers fight for places in the olympic finals it can only be that someone wants to harm the boxers the coach and british boxing otherwise this is just a stupid mistake or misunderstanding
6467922 my focus over the next 48 hours is to prepare my three boxers for their semi final bouts tomorrow
6467923 the allegations made in the media about the conduct of athletes on the british boxing programme are on the whole unfounded
6467924 i have plenty of space to improvise to try new ideas
6467925 everything you do eating sleeping walking talking will be decided by me
6467926 grazie a dio il mio amico putin mi ha ascoltato altrimenti col cavolo che i carri armati russi si sarebbero fermati a quindici chilometri da tbilisi abbiamo evitato un inutile bagno di sangue
6467927 nessuno su questa terra pi felice di colui che trova il vero amore
6467928 i would advise that you contact your isp internet service provider about this matter
6467929 we know what we need on a global level in terms of reductions
6467930 we cannot continue forever saying this is an issue for the industrial countries and no one else should do anything
6467931 unless we come with a spirit of co operation trying to resolve things instead of making things more and more complicated
6467932 a lot of governments dont have positions yet and are going through internal processes where ideas are still festering
6467933 everything must go were slashing prices on tons of films we acquired bargain basement prices
6467934 up to july 2008 this year has been cooler than the previous five years at least it still looks like its warmer than average
6467935 who the h3ll would use it anyway you would have to be crazy
6467936 guess what we are building right here how can we get the keys
6467937 please listen to me yell no one listens to me anymore
6467938 and no one could ever give us an answer what the outcome would be or what the expectancy would be
6467939 he has a very unusual rearrangement of his genetic material its whats called an inversion of chromosome 12 and it affects every single cell in his body
6467940 peace never enters into the plans of the georgian leadership and it never will
6467941 a return to the past is a return to the massive abrogations of the rights of our people and a return to war
6467942 if the possibility of leading peace negotiations was preserved before the attack on south ossetia then with the aggression against zkhinvali georgia itself beat in the final nail in the coffin of its own sovereignty and territorial integrity he announced
6467943 with the number of migrants arriving from the new eu countries now approaching one million the governments estimate that a maximum of just 13 000 migrants a year would arrive from these countries is woeful
6467944 labour must realise that immigration can benefit the country but only if it is properly controlled
6467945 there has not been much evidence of any significant russian withdrawals
6467946 this is a model we need to use if we want to clean up puget sound
6467947 you want a rocky reef with lots of nooks and crannies with a tire the center gets filled with sand and its a big slab of rubber
6467948 i have spent the past seven months burning up my cell phone going to meetings
6467949 its a real world mission instead of moving fake cargo
6467950 its training the army is spending the money anyway so we might as well do something good for the environment
6467951 in housing the need is high but the ability to meet the need is very low
6467952 people think that nothings being done and quite frankly thats true
6467953 providing affordable housing has gotten more difficult and the number one reason is land values
6467954 the effort to save the quay was huge and at a huge cost with so many layers of financing
6467955 but hopefully it will be something for the community to rally around
6467956 if the clanging gets loud enough maybe well all move forward and address this seriously
6467957 i dont have a magic bullet for housing and i dont know if anyone does
6467958 energy suppliers have to take steps towards covering their costs and i am sorry that we cannot delay these price rises any longer
6467959 although this will be little consolation these increases would have been even higher but for the fact wholesale prices have fallen back a little in recent weeks
6467960 soaring energy bills pose a huge threat to our standard of living gas and electricity are essential commodities which have now become a luxury that many can no longer afford
6467961 however you look at it today is a bad news day for consumers consumers are going to have to adjust quickly and there are two key steps to this making sure we pay the lowest possible price for our energy and learning to use less of it
6467962 its not just consumers who are confused about what drives price rises the wholesale price of oil and gas has fallen back in recent weeks but companies still feel the need to raise prices by staggering amounts
6467963 the hard fact is that prices are still set in relation to an irrational and toxic link to the price of oil whether the remedy is to break the contractual link between oil and gas prices or whether it is to find other ways to force greater competition into the european wholesale market it must be the subject of determined and vigorous intervention by competition authorities at home and in europe
6467964 with announcements from government and ofgem expected in the next month we will see whether there is a coherent plan to tackle the myriad failings in this market
6467965 for all the talk about changing the electoral map the core of it is still the same right here
6467966 mccain is looking at the nature of the electorate and has a reasonable chance to cherry pick some voters
6467967 these are the kinds of voters who were reluctant to vote for obama in the primary and the republicans think they can make inroads with them
6467968 a vast complex of ideas policies and actions is comprehended under the phrase manifest destiny they are not as we should expect all compatible nor do they come from any one source
6467969 to establish on earth the moral dignity and salvation of man
6467970 our manifest destiny to overspread the continent allotted by providence for the free development of our yearly multiplying millions
6467971 and that claim is by the right of our manifest destiny to overspread and to possess the whole of the continent which providence has given us for the development of the great experiment of liberty and federated self government entrusted to us
6467972 i suppose the right of a manifest destiny to spread will not be admitted to exist in any nation except the universal yankee nation
6467973 the most enduring statement of americas manifest destiny and mission
6467974 of the monroe doctrine because while the monroe doctrine did not specify expansion expansion was necessary in order to enforce the doctrine
6467975 the expansionism of the 1830s arose as a defensive effort to forestall the encroachment of europe in north america
6467976 what seemed like territorial expansionism actually arose from a defensive mentality not from ambitions for conquest and annexation
6467977 if freedom is the best of national blessings if self government is the first of national rights then we are bound to sympathise with the cause of the canadian rebellion
6467978 after the american civil war shared some resemblances to the actions of the hunters but were otherwise unrelated to the idea of manifest destiny or any policy of american expansionism

6468006 initially scanning electron microscopy sem conducted at another laboratory showed high silicon and oxygen signals that led them to conclude that the spores were a weaponized form says kotula
6468007 the possible misinterpretation of the sem results arose because microanalysis in the sem is not a surface sensitive tool
6468008 because a spore body can be 1 5 to 2 microns wide by 1 micron long a sem cannot localize the elemental signal from whole spore bodies
6468009 lacked that fuzzy outer coating that would indicate that theyd been weaponized

6468032 the beijing games would be a factor in my decision but on the same level as salt lake city turin and athens
6468033 as far as i am concerned the games are going as i wished but the olympic family is not just me the athletes are happy the nocs are happy and so are the international federations if
6468034 i will announce my plans for the future after the games are over my decision will be sent to the ioc members and then i will inform the media

6468037 on july 17 i was flying back to brussels and three or four belgian journalists approached me and asked me will you run in 2009
6468038 i knew what samaranch had to do in his role as president as i had been an ioc member since 1991
6468039 i had since that time been handed the responsibility of being in charge of the coordination commission for the 2000 games in sydney and then for athens though that was only 50 percent as having been elected president i handed over that responsibility to denis oswald
6468040 i have to do things that are not that pleasant during the games such as the protocols like raising funds
6468041 un nen em va preguntar on s el meu pare

6468048 we should be careful we dont give the wrong signals to show that we rather condone the indiscipline and all those things that are happening
6468049 so everything is looking up everything is looking positive its just what we expected
6468050 hes like oh you gotta do a little more than that and i ask him how much and hes like the swim teams swims about 10 miles a day and i was only doing a half mile so it humbled me a little bit

6468061 these individuals belong to one of the most affluent generations in history and are willing and able to pay for products that provide anti aging benefits
6468062 we are trying to push the players to use skirts and also nicer shirts not the shirts that are made for men but ones with more curves
6468063 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6468064 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6468065 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
6468066 the negotiators have taken this very very far but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces operate
6468067 obviously the american forces are here coalition forces are here at the invitation of the iraqi government
6468068 what were trying to do is put together an agreement that protects our people respects iraqs sovereignty
6468069 but the goal is to have iraqi forces responsible for the security of iraq
6468070 that is the goal and that has been the goal from the beginning
6468071 were not sitting here talking about an agreement to try to get out of a bad situation
6468072 builds on the success we have had in the last year this agreement is based on success
6468073 really we are very very close to closing this agreement
6468074 and as we said from the beginning there is no hidden agenda here
6468075 but really we are redoubling our efforts to bring this to a successful conclusion
6468076 we as the sadr movement denounce this dubious visit and such timing we reaffirm our stance of rejecting the long term agreement we demand the iraqi government and on the highest levels not to sign this unjust agreement and we demand the withdrawal of the government as soon as possible

6468086 might permit an innocent american to be subjected to such intrusive surveillance based in part on race ethnicity national origin religion or on protected first amendment activities
6468087 integrate more completely and harmonize the standards that apply to the f b i s activities
6468088 simply based on somebodys race religion or exercise of first amendment rights
6468089 this document clarifies the rules by which the f b i conducts its intelligence mission
6468090 this seems to be based on the idea that the government can take a bunch of data and create a profile that can be used to identify future bad guys
6468091 but that has not been demonstrated to be true anywhere else
6468092 every time we do something you tell me america will do this and will do that i want to tell you something very clear dont worry about american pressure on israel we the jewish people control america and the americans know it

6468101 davis embarked on what can only be characterized as a witch hunt to identify students who were homosexual and their supporters further adding fuel to the fire
6468102 he went so far as to lift the shirts of female students to ensure the letters gp or the words gay pride were not written on their bodies
6468103 i just felt like i had to stand up for the kids heather wanted to do this and i had to back her
6468104 i think a shirt that says i support gays is very different from a shirt that says gays are going to hell
6468105 one can be very disruptive for a childs self esteem the other supports other people and their ideas
6468106 i emphasize that davis personal and religious views about homosexuality are not issues in this case indeed davis opinions and views are consistent with the beliefs of many in holmes county in florida and in the country
6468107 where davis went wrong was when he endeavored to silence the opinions of his dissenters
6468108 david davis is a fine man and good principal and we are a gentle peaceful christian family oriented community
6468109 every time we do something you tell me america will do this and will do that i want to tell you something very clear dont worry about american pressure on israel we the jewish people control america and the americans know it

6468418 identity theft red flags and address discrepancies under the fair and accurate credit transactions act facta of 2003
6468419 while most companies have some form of fraud prevention or data security in place the facta red flags guidelines require financial institutions and creditors in the united states to do more by making senior management accountable to its board of directors for implementing measures that prevent detect and respond to identity theft events occurring within their organization
6468420 emcs full spectrum of consulting and product offerings for facta compliance provides organizations and senior management with whatever solutions best fit their needs all from a single provider to help them meet the upcoming facta red flags deadline
6468421 our facta solutions help spur a broader corporate governance strategy that enables businesses to comply with future regulations and protect information throughout its lifecycle wherever it is across the organization said steve preston senior director compliance solutions at rsa
6468422 using our solutions customers can gain more visibility into their organizations be better positioned to use that information for heightened business intelligence and ultimately map their it security investments directly to business objectives
6468423 like most businesses we relied very heavily on independent silos of knowledge and expertise we evaluated a variety of solutions to this common problem that ranged from an aggressive internal training program to moving from in house processing to outsourcing our visits with other banks that are outsourcing their information and transaction processing to jack henry banking convinced us that we simply didnt want the responsibility of data processing anymore our move from a cif 20 20 based in house operation to a cif 20 20 based outsourced operation was seamless since it didnt require a conversion on the monday morning after the weekend migration our employees literally couldnt see a single difference other than they needed a new password or two in the way they did their jobs and served our customers our staff immediately embraced the change and more importantly the migration was completely transparent to our customers completely outsourcing has made our day to day work life easier and if we knew then what we know now we would have moved to outsourcing sooner outsourcing is the best thing weve done for our bank in years
6468424 the move from in house processing to outsourcing is a growing trend and we are proactively helping a number of our core clients evaluate outsourcing outsourcing enables banks to leverage our extensive infrastructure and processing environment to eliminate the capital expenditures required for in house systems the need for resident resources to operate and manage in house data centers and long term capacity planning outsourcing also provides banks with the ability to focus on their core competencies with ongoing access to advancing technology strict regulatory compliance and our technology and security experts
6468425 our outsourcing business represents a significant component of our recurring revenue and these migrations have the potential to generate more revenue long term largely based on an outsourced banks ability to implement more of our complementary solutions without the initial capital expenditures required for in house installations in the near term these migrations replace in house maintenance fee income with monthly processing fees and our customers typically implement additional complementary products during the migration to outsourcing

6468441 it might look like the number has been reduced but the change is too small and the number of deaths is still considered too high
6468442 to put this into perspective thailands emergency medical services system still looks like a first grade student compared to most developed countries such as japan or in western europe
6468443 the most obstructive problem we are facing here is not about the budget equipment or staff its the lack of effective response to emergencies surachet said
6468444 a very easy way to understand the problem is to look at bangkok it is the city which has the most skilled staff best equipped medical units yet the efficiency of its emergency medical services is still lower than many other cities in thailand
6468445 i think we have done a pretty good job but when an accident happens the traffic gets even worse
6468446 it makes it even harder for the emergency medical units to reach the scene but we try to solve the problem by sending police officers to clear the road
6468447 we have trained at chulalongkorn university hospital and often arrive at the scene of an accident before emergency medical units do said sompong
6468448 nowadays a lot more emergency medical service ambulances are operating than before but its never enough volunteers are still necessary around here
6468449 if there is in fact a silver lining to this it is that people are paying more attention to open standards
6468450 multiple national standards may be appropriate in areas such as building and clothes where local geographic and climatic conditions make unique international standards less useful as a general rule the objective at the international level is to have one globally relevant standard it can sometimes happen especially in fast moving areas such as it that broadly similar standards but focused on different functionalities may each engage the interest of market segments in such cases multiple standards can exist and it is the market that eventually decides which will survive
6468451 everyone knows i love la but london watch out im coming to town and bringing my fast paced life with me
6468452 advancing this work through the open standards process offers tangible benefits for device and platform vendors developers and consumers alike
6468453 these standards will enable the development of a new generation of enterprise enabled resources which can be automatically discovered and then function seamlessly together
6468454 this work will make it possible for a wide variety of devices to find each other and interoperate using web services techniques
6468455 the project will leverage existing basic web services methods to expand the scope of soa networks to a much broader range of machines and endpoints
6468456 ws dd is complementary to standards such as uddi and it will help improve the scale and flexibility of applications through the improved dynamic discovery of devices such as smart phones and services that may not be connected ca will continue to work closely with other industry leaders to enable a new generation of management security and governance solutions that support these more dynamic flexible applications
6468457 the formation of the ws dd technical committee is an important milestone and builds upon mature ws base protocols by expanding the scope to include the wide variety of devices being used today in homes and enterprises defining protocols for discovering securely consuming and exposing web services in a lightweight footprint that suits these devices has the potential to greatly broaden the reach of web services to meet customers needs discovery of enterprise resources whether devices or web services can help make large scale soa implementations more robust and simpler to manage
6468458 red hat is pleased to be involved with ws dd as we believe this is an important missing piece of the ws standardization effort particularly as it applies to the ongoing move towards more autonomous and large scale infrastructures that we are seeing being developed
6468459 a lightweight protocol for locating and identifying web services instances dynamically within an ad hoc environment should prove invaluable for enterprise level monitoring of soa landscapes by building upon the ws discovery specification we can address such requirements in a pragmatic and interoperable manner as the co author of the original specification were delighted to take a leadership role in advancing this standard further through the formation and work of the new technical committee in oasis

6468492 todd and shonnah bentley are presently experiencing significant friction in their relationship and are currently separated we want to affirm that there has been no sexual immorality on the part of either todd or shonnah nor has there ever been
6468493 we have discovered new information revealing that todd bentley has entered into an unhealthy relationship on an emotional level with a female member of his staff in light of this new information and in consultation with his leaders and advisors todd bentley has agreed to step down from his position on the board of directors and to refrain from all public ministry for a season to receive counsel in his personal life
6468494 ive been assured by his people that there is no third party involved
6468495 told me he kept me out of the loop for my protection
6468496 three years ago he did the exact same thing he grew out of his relationship to his wife and transferred his affection to another the bottom line is that he was traveling too much and not taking care of his wife and family like he should
6468497 i was involved in a restoration process to help todd a couple years ago in this very area
6468498 i have known todd for several years and have seen god work mightily through him

6468790 we offer this trip down memory lane at the prison house but it is ultimately a lesson to move on we want to move forward as a nation we have to we cannot do it alone we need supporters there is a reason why we have the delete button bleach washing powder leaders make many mistakes but we believe that we can make so much change in the nation
6468791 we didnt adapt well to prison life it got so out of control most of us were teenage high school students when they are in one place together anything can happen
6468792 we talked to the wardens about rugby but we would degenerate into politics and they didnt like it we insisted that it was them that brought politics into sport
6468793 when i perceived the beauty of even this small closed in corner of the world i knew that some day my people and i would be free
6468794 we have no money no food we want change i dream of going to school and being a social worker
6468795 we are experiencing a situation where the adult population is dying off so children are on their own
6468796 we are asking what theory of change are you using how do we change societies empower communities
6468797 im assuming that as unemployment rises and inflation pressures subside australian financial conditions will need to be shifted from extremely restrictive to only mildly restrictive
6468798 if that is right the rba probably will be forced to return standard mortgage rates from 9 1 2 per cent today to 8 per cent
6468799 over the past two to three weeks there has been a substantial fall in the price of money in the australian marketplace
6468800 thats come about through the reserve indicating there is going to be an interest rate cut over the next few weeks
6468801 what were forecasting through to next year is that those sources of funds will continue to rise and continue to put upward pressure on the banks cost of funds
6468802 it was substantially above the reserves cash rate and its the banks cost of funds that determines the mortgage rate
6468803 mortgage rates are 9 per cent or more at present essentially because the rba is happy for them to be there
6468804 the vets who had a look at him were really surprised at how fast hed gone downhill
6468805 hes having difficulties breathing and his flippers were at an unnatural angle
6468806 their advice to us was hes not going to last much longer hes suffering and you should take action
6468807 theyll need to locate it first and the poor little guy could have passed away in the night
6468808 once they figure out whats happened theyll take it from there
6468809 its a really tragic result from an operation that people worked really really hard for
6468810 theres no way that the logistics of feeding that animal by hand or in an aquarium is going to work
6468811 there are too many difficulties with it and the animal first of all has to be convinced to eat out of a tube its got to get to an aquarium and then youve got to find a product for it to eat which you can supply for probably a year
6468812 so i think for humans to try and keep it alive is just going to end up as a disaster
6468813 get it into the vicinity of the other cow and calf and hopefully the cow would take on two calves which would be pretty unusual
6468814 there were four cookie cutter shark bites in it and that has most likely occurred while it was out in the open water its just another thing that compounds the whole problem
6468815 even if they are able to entice the calf out into open water it would face a higher predation pressure from sharks
6468816 our hearts are breaking with whats happening with baby colin
6468817 the key here is hes weakening hes losing the strength to get him fed and to a pod that will care for him
6468818 would be complicated and expensive and barely begin to meet the growth in demand for electricity that is expected in the coming years
6468819 gov george e pataki expressed concern about the danger the blades would pose to migrating birds and others worried about them icing up
6468820 are you going to put a big windmill on the top of the empire state building i think thats very unlikely can you put windmills off the coastline that is highly likely
6468821 my buildings are known for their great architecture so id have to give it some serious thought
6468822 its the title of one of my favorite childrens stories something from nothing by phoebe gilman
6468823 i will have to admit i splurge a bit on my make up and buy it at nordstrom but i feel in the long run it is cheaper
6468824 its just a whole bunch of little things that started adding up
6468825 i didnt get a sense i was accomplishing anything anymore
6468826 i think weve lost sight of what we really should be focusing on
6468827 are we holding this applicant to a higher standard that we held another applicant weve got to be consistent
6468828 im just wondering if my goals and the goals of others were in conflict here
6468829 i do think were losing a valuable resource in somebody that has tremendous knowledge of the environmental issues in the town and has been working hard to preserve the natural resources of the town
6468830 hes stood up to people that have tried to circumvent those things and he will be a loss in that respect
6468831 i think its a great loss for the town because of the amount of work hes put in on issues that dont come to the public eye
6468832 people were using conservation for their reason for everything when they were never there for every other conservation issue in the past
6468833 my feeling was its a very tricky situation very complex and it should sink or swim on its own merits
6468834 i truly believe theres been a greater awareness not just by the people in exeter but everywhere about what conservation means doing things that are environmentally sound protecting our rivers and so forth
6468835 i think that makes you feel good that you no longer have to get up and be the only one arguing something
6468836 ive loved the working relationship ive had with a lot of people in town i cannot speak more highly of the dpw they have been so great
6468837 we strongly urge parents not to allow children to play with those because they can cause personal injury
6468838 a lot of toy guns look real and we strongly urge parents not to allow children to play with those either because they can be mistaken for real
6468839 swimming isnt as visible in this part of the country as say florida and south california and texas
6468840 there are a number of teams in new england we are going to be pushing the problem that we all face in this area is the challenge of pool space it would be great if we could use this as a launch off to keep pools open or make more
6468841 one year after the olympics we had our tryout for the lesson program which basically is learning about the sport
6468842 we had a line outside the pool and in the lobby and into the parking lot over 100 kids tried out that day
6468843 its the success a lot of good athletes just tend to gravitate toward swimming because of the success if you get a bunch of new people to try out and even half of them decide its not for them you have more people on the team that wouldnt have tried if it wasnt for the olympics
6468844 swimming is not necessarily looked on as a mainstream boys sports
6468845 phelps has given validity to the masculine aspect of the sport hes incredibly in shape and athletic even the basketball team was there rooting him on hes definitely been positive for the visibility of the sport
6468846 i think michael phelps that name will last a long time in the mainstream
6468847 that i could be painting your toenails right now that i could see you do that little cheerleader move that i could be your human lollipop that i could take a shower in your shower with all that girly stuff
6468848 its our goal to be as relevant as possible to as many people as we can
6468849 when i have shopped for situations like babies or weddings for gay friends i have good luck in quirky stores
6468850 but if you are just in a generic store the bride and groom symbol or words are in most cards
6468851 it becomes difficult to find some that are neutral but have some style
6468852 the fact that you have someone like hallmark going into that niche shows its growing and signals a trend
6468853 a lot of people think a gay greeting card needs a rainbow on it
6468854 what is scary is to produce a marriage line and then november comes and its recalled then we have thousands of dollars of inventory waiting

6468858 although plum island has long hosted research into animal disease the new facility would take the public health threat literally to a new level
6468859 the environmental security risks are intolerable in an area so densely populated heavily traveled and environmentally valued the threat of accident or attack is hardly hypothetical or speculative as recent experience has taught to our sorrow these dangers are real and substantial and have not been adequately considered
6468860 brian brings to the table a wealth of experience that will greatly benefit the development and completion of our projects

6468919 a lot of black republicans wont tell you theyre supporting obama
6468920 i think it will be worse for mccain and better for obama because mccain cant afford to lose any black supporters
6468921 it will be a lot harder for mccain to garner support from african american conservatives
6468922 im sure its a real issue for some people but most black conservatives i talk to do not seem to be struggling with this question
6468923 its not a complete surprise to find republicans defecting to the democratic side during this election much of that resulting from the unpopularity of the current president the state of the economy and an unpopular war
6468924 there is a clear lack of confidence in republican leadership in addition to many younger new school republicans showing open disaffection for the direction of their party which they think is relying too much on old methods
6468925 their is also a sense amongst many moderate republicans who hold the key to expanding the party and navigating it out of its current predicament that the conservative hold on the party particularly by evangelists has put the party into a significant bind plus mccains infamous temperament rubbed many party leaders and elected officials the wrong way in past years
6468926 another key sign of this inner party disillusionment is not only reflected in prominent republican lawmakers showing support for obama or republican voters not feeling mccain but its also seeing many african american republicans and conservatives alike openly supporting obama in defiance of the gop and its predominantly white leadership
6468927 it is quite clear that the specter of an obama presidency presents a conundrum for blacks who are fiscal conservatives and believe that limited government free markets and equal opportunity are great equalizers
6468928 clearly pride in obamas achievements in a nation where slavery was the original sin may play a decisive factor in how some black conservatives decide to vote in november
6468929 additionally senator obamas mantra of personal responsibility particularly within the black community is a deeply conservative and alluring philosophy that many conservatives black and white may find as an attractive means to finally get past issues of race in our great nation
6468930 we feel that within these principles lay our past but also our future successes also we understand that the principles are more long lasting and greater than any one candidate in a party thats something we cleave to as young republicans as well
6468931 we are the sect of the republican party that is young urban and focused on addressing urban issues with republican priniciples
6468932 i was offended not because sen obama said that he would not pick justice thomas but because of the qualifications aspect of his opinion
6468933 a lot of black republicans see that as code for several things including being an uncle tom and being someone that doesnt relate to black people
6468934 it wouldnt be surprising if those black republicans and conservatives who are tasked to campaign or support mccain will privately cast a vote for obama there just isnt any enthusiasm on the black right for mccain

6468937 its our goal to be as relevant as possible to as many people as we can
6468938 when i have shopped for situations like babies or weddings for gay friends i have good luck in quirky stores
6468939 but if you are just in a generic store the bride and groom symbol or words are in most cards
6468940 it becomes difficult to find some that are neutral but have some style
6468941 the fact that you have someone like hallmark going into that niche shows its growing and signals a trend
6468942 a lot of people think a gay greeting card needs a rainbow on it
6468943 what is scary is to produce a marriage line and then november comes and its recalled then we have thousands of dollars of inventory waiting
6468944 we are pleased that local children have a safe place to play football and proud that the new orleans saints directed our attention to this field project
6468945 our nfl youth football fund grants help provide youngsters with fields that will help them achieve their athletic goals
6468946 we are extremely enthusiastic to be involved with the efforts in new orleans to restore one of the citys most important recreational facilities
6468947 city park has long been one of the gems of the city and pan american stadium has long held a very important place with the communitys youth and high school sports programs the new fieldturf surface at pan american is top notch and will provide the stadium with the ability to host an unlimited number of sporting events the shell shockers and all of the high schools that utilize pan american will know that they are playing on the safest most playable and best artificial turf product manufactured in the world today
6468948 the majority of data loss incidents are associated with simple human error and by well meaning employees going around policies in trying to carry out their jobs
6468949 the most effective strategies for preventing data loss include a combination of enabling technologies including data discovery and classification data monitoring and filtering and endpoint data protection
6468950 it is like compacting your entire wardrobe into a shoebox
6468951 what takes care of neutralizing dna to allow chromosomes to condense
6468952 did dinoflagellates once have histones and then lost them or did dinoflagellates never have histones and just figured out a different way to fold large amounts of dna into chromosomes
6468953 chromosomes would fall apart when calcium and magnesium were removed
6468954 the impact of climate change on human and global security could extend far beyond the limited scope the world has seen thus far
6468955 most critical for human survival are water and food which are sensitive to changing climatic conditions
6468956 environmental changes caused by global warming will not only affect human living conditions but may also generate larger societal effects by threatening the infrastructures of society or by inducing social responses that aggravate the problem
6468957 the associated socio economic and political stress can undermine the functioning of communities the effectiveness of institutions and the stability of societal structures these degraded conditions could contribute to civil strife and worse armed conflict
6468958 large areas of africa are suffering from scarcity of food and fresh water resources making them more vulnerable to conflict an example is sudans darfur province where an ongoing conflict was aggravated since droughts forced arab herders to move into areas of african farmers
6468959 although climate change bears a significant conflict potential it can also transform the international system toward more cooperation if it is seen as a common threat that requires joint action
6468960 the bali roadmap has many good ideas but was criticized as being too vague to induce a major policy shift
6468961 nevertheless the seeming conflict between environment and the economy will be best overcome with the recognition that protecting the climate in the best interest of the economy
6468962 history has shown how dependent our culture is on a narrow window of climatic conditions for average temperature and precipitation
6468963 the great human civilizations began to flourish after the last ice age and some disappeared due to droughts and other adverse shifts in the climate
6468964 the consequences were quite severe in parts of europe associated with loss of harvest and population decline
6468965 riots and military conflicts became more likely as a recent empirical study has suggested
6468966 the challenge is to slow down the dynamics and stabilize the climate system at levels which are not dangerous
6468967 global warming receives now more public and political attention than a few years ago
6468968 grass roots movements are emerging in the united states for protecting the climate and developing energy alternatives involving not only many local communities and companies but also influential states such as california led by gov arnold schwarzenegger
6468969 congressional and presidential candidates now acknowledge that something has to be done to play a leading role on energy and climate change to not fall behind the rest of the world
6468970 the approach is a new application of the well known botanical phenomenon of aerial root development
6468971 instead of using plant branches this patented approach takes malleable roots and shapes them into useful objects for indoors and out
6468972 he was a humble man what wrong did he do to anyone why was he punished these cruel people have taken away the great shadow of my father
6468973 all around the gate i saw blood and human flesh people helped the injured and took them in their cars and even on motorbikes to the hospital
6468974 seven or eight people were already dead and another 10 people were breathing their last
6468975 there are two torn bodies lying there which we believe are those of the suicide bombers
6468976 only innocent people die when the pakistan army carries out airstrikes in bajur or swat
6468977 if the army is really fond of fighting it should send ground forces to see how we fight
6468978 the future of this coalition is linked to the restoration of judges
6468979 if the judges are not restored we will prefer to sit on opposition benches
6468980 there is now incontrovertible evidence that marketing of tobacco and the depiction of smoking in the movies promote youth smoking and can cause young people to begin smoking
6468981 the role of the media in promoting and reducing tobacco use
6468982 the role of marketing in the success of the tobacco companies is conclusive
6468983 the reports recommendations offer the best approach to employ marketing techniques and the media to help prevent a further increase in youth smoking
6468984 this direct link between marketing and tobacco use is very powerful
6468985 anti tobacco ads before films and a comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising are two effective strategies found to curb effects of tobacco images on youth now we need to use marketing to steer youth and others away from tobacco
6468986 no matter how often private citizens damage publicly owned trees it is always shocking
6468987 the plane would not fail to the point of causing a tragedy
6468988 most likely whatever the malfunction of the probe was it is probably not related to what happened
6468989 as long as the commodity side of the business is not being detrimental to our results were satisfied with that
6468990 that was obviously not the picture in this quarter and it wont be next quarter either
6468991 i dont consider myself an alcoholic and i never will consider myself an alcoholic but i got in trouble because of alcohol and to me thats a problem i had to change things in my life so i changed them
6468992 i was ashamed of what i did when it first happened and embarrassed all the emotions that came along with it but you know what it happened i made a mistake at the same time ive been through a lot and ive overcome a lot im actually very proud of myself for what ive overcome
6468993 cold when i am denied it your light is ultraviolet
6468994 theyre a bunch of better than thou elitists who hate the little guy
6468995 we were thinking jack daniels but do you think that crown royal is better
6468996 now you want to win and saying it doesnt make it so
6468997 it would be nice to think that after eight years of economic disaster after eight years of bungled foreign policy of being engaged in a war that should never have been authorized and should never have been waged that cost us a trillion dollars and thousands of lives that people would say lets toss the bums out toss the bums out were starting from scratch were starting over this is not working
6468998 so i understand why a lot of folks are saying this should just happen why are we having to run all these television commercials why do we have to raise all this money just read the papers these are the knuckleheads who have been in charge throw em out but american politics arent that simple
6468999 it would be great if the country said lets throw the bums out and i didnt have to campaign
6469000 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6469001 it doesnt matter if they were or werent involved in an attack today yesterday or on sept 11 2001 we seek out terrorists and we will give them the option to be captured or killed or possibly flee
6469002 everyone knows that terrorism is particularly fed by what is happening in afghanistan
6469003 we have no information allowing us to consider that french soldiers were killed under fire of nato planes

6469021 this is a sensible move which will benefit the force and people of staffordshire operationally and give our staff better purpose built accommodation on one site
6469022 the move also supports stafford borough councils property strategy as it frees up a prime site for residential development which can only be good for local people and businesses
6469023 this deal justifies our decision to spec build the largest office buildings to date in stafford and brings us close to completing our 10 year development of more than 300 000 sq ft of office space at staffordshire technology park which has helped provide a home for some 4 000 jobs in the town

6469028 i think my training was going really well and i was able tonight to stay focused on what i had to do and not stay focused on my result or on how the other divers were diving

6469053 i was not raised in a religious household for my mother organized religion too often dressed up closed mindedness in the garb of piety cruelty and oppression in the cloak of righteousness
6469054 this isnt to say that she provided me with no religious instruction
6469055 in sum my mother viewed religion through the eyes of the anthropologist she would become it was a phenomenon to be treated with a suitable respect but with a suitable detachment as well
6469056 twenty times in the course of my late reading have i been upon the point of breaking out this would be the best of all possible worlds if there were no religion in it
6469057 the government of the united states of america is not in any sense founded on the christian religion
6469058 religious bondage shackles and debilitates the mind and unfits it for every noble enterprise
6469059 during almost fifteen centuries has the legal establishment of christianity been on trial what have been its fruits more or less in all places pride and indolence in the clergy ignorance and servility in the laity in both superstition bigotry and persecution

6469064 before you hire a company to build a house you would i expect insist on detailed plans showing what the finished structure was going to look like building a childs mind and character is what public schools do their justification for prematurely breaking family and neighborhood learning where is documentary evidence to prove this assumption that trained and certified professionals do it better than people who know and love them can there isnt any the cost in new york state for building a well schooled child in the year 2000 is 200 000 per body when lost interest is calculated that capital sum invested in the childs name over the past twelve years would have delivered a million dollars to each kid as a nest egg to compensate for having no school the original 200 000 is more than the average home in new york costs you wouldnt build a home without some idea what it would look like when finished but you are compelled to let a corps of perfect strangers tinker with your childs mind and personality without the foggiest idea what they want to do with it

6469078 due to the current rift between the united states and russia the possibility of these two countries cooperating in the short term in the security council over irans nuclear issue is unlikely iranian officials will try to take advantage of this situation and gain as many concessions as possible from the 5 1 group before reaching a conclusion with the group
6469079 russia is basically against a nuclear iran and will eventually cooperate with the united states to curb irans enrichment program
6469080 no substantial changes are envisaged in moscows policy toward irans nuclear issue
6469081 though russia might delay a decision on the next security council resolution or reduce the level of further sanctions that may be imposed on iran
6469082 it is striking to me that anyone would believe that russia is involved in trying to keep iran from getting a nuclear weapon as a favor to the united states

6469100 this was by far the most painful injury ive ever experienced
6469101 now that im older im just kind of wiser to the fact i kind of had this feeling of being invincible when i was younger learning the hard way i just realized that its not worth it if youre not 100 percent and thats why i took this time off to make sure i was in the right condition to fight
6469102 shes jumped on board and been really supportive over the past few months which has really helped me out a lot but i think its been harder for her than for me just because we do have kids together a family
6469103 it was real serious what happened but she says i could have died because i was able to get into the hospital in time and they were able to take care of it you could die from getting a cold or pneumonia but it doesnt mean you almost died
6469104 i kind of turned it into the fact that no matter what happens to me i can come back so you can kind of go either way with it
6469105 a lot of the injuries ive had a lot of people havent been able to recover 100 percent from ive been able to come back and actually learn from those mistakes and i think im better because of it
6469106 im trying to become the bionic man and thats a lot of the reason i like doing what i do

6469170 tail docking a dog would be illegal putting a lobster in boiling water would be illegal but it will be legal to abort a six month old child if this bill passes
6469171 from the outset i have declared that i am pro life i find it extremely difficult to support a bill that enables a woman to abort a baby up to six months gestation
6469172 it effectively is the status quo and provides accepted safeguards and i also have a very solid view that men should not be telling women what to do with their bodies
6469173 i support the original model c as proposed by the victorian law reform commission which goes further than the governments bill and puts the decision in the hands of women at any stage of the pregnancy
6469174 im just glad for the parents that this has come to an end
6469175 at least hes found and hopefully the parents can move on

6469187 when the kingdom of byzantium was subjected by the arabs practically the whole land belonged to the big proprietorswhile the soil was cultivated by the former owners who had remained on their plots as tenants
6469188 the palestinian arabs arethe descendants of the philistines and of all semitic peoples who have lived in palestine since the time of the canaanites
6469189 the historical record disproves the zionist lie that palestine was undeveloped before the establishment of jewish settlements in palestine muqqadisi a native of jerusalem who died in 986 a d enumerated the principal products of palestine in the 10th century among whose agricultural produce was particularly copious and prized fruit of every kind olives figs grapes quinces plums apples dates walnuts almonds jujube and bananas
6469190 palestine is watered by the rains and dew its trees and plowed fields do not need artificial irrigation palestine is the most fertile of the syrian provinces
6469191 in 1615 the english traveler george sandys described palestine as a land that flows with milk and honey
6469192 the german geographer alexander scholch concluded that between 1856 and 1892 palestine produced a relatively large agricultural surplus which was marketed in neighboring countries
6469193 laurence oliphant who visited palestine in 1887 wrote that palestines valley of esdraelon was a huge green lake of waving wheatand it presents one of the most striking pictures of luxuriant fertility which it is possible to conceive
6469194 wheat shipments from the palestinian port of acre had helped to save southern france from famine on numerous occasions in the 17th and 18th centuries
6469195 in 1948 the zionists seized 90 percent of arab owned citrus groves packaging and storage facilities as well as that years crop looting the prosperous arab citrus groves and making them the arab owners destitute refugees
6469196 the indigenous arab population was recognized by paragraph 4 of article xxii of the league of nations covenant as a provisionally independent nation palestine was placed under a class a mandate the very status of which indicated that the indigenous population was well advanced toward self determination

6469213 senator mccains proposal is bold its aggressive its an all of the above approach
6469214 senator obama has taken a very minimalist or none of the above or very few of the above approaches
6469215 i personally believe that if barack obama gets elected he will slam the door shut on these options

6469224 to win any medal in the olympics is a huge achievement
6469225 not many of the athletes get a chance to win a medal
6469226 i have to take something positive from the way i was playing this week
6469227 thats what i expected and hoped for many years ago when i got to no 1 that if ever somebody were to take it away from me he would have to play an incredible tennis schedule win the biggest tournaments dominate the game basically i think rafa totally deserves it
6469228 its not the first time this tournament or in my life i had to serve for a big match

6469230 im sure all the fans in russia will be very happy about it
6469231 i didnt sleep enough im just really happy that i could put all my energy into the match and pull out the match
6469232 i had him a few times in the first set but he came up with some great shots these courts are low bouncing and you have to get down and its hard to pass

6469237 nowhere in my best dreams i can imagine something like what i did this year
6469238 i know how difficult it is to win these things and especially here because you only have one chance every four years
6469239 it does mean more for me to win it with serena to share this kind of moment with your sister
6469240 its unbelievable for me this is the best moment in my career ill never forget it
6469241 to serve you have to push yourself up to jump up and when the legs are a little bit slow it just doesnt go

6469263 when one so heavily depends on one source of revenue it leaves one vulnerable
6469264 we had a downturn like so many other organizations have experienced over the year
6469265 because when i go to the court and the other players know i beat 19 players in a row and nobody can beat me it is good for me
6469266 but the important points i played very good that was the difference
6469267 im pretty sad that maybe i couldnt give 100 percent today
6469268 its pretty sore too tight and i feel it when i move or serve or get ready for a return
6469269 he started to serve very slowly and i did very good returns i broke very early in the first set after that i start to play my game i didnt give him many chances

6469280 why do i want to watch some chick with muscles in all the wrong places lifting stuff its a mans sport
6469281 i think its actually pretty sexy a woman who wants to look after her body and who can take care of herself whats wrong with that some women do go a bit overboard but its nice to see a woman with a bit of meat on her who youre not worried you might break nothing sexier in my eyes
6469282 ive spoken all week about how much ive enjoyed the olympic experience how much i love the spirit of it
6469283 thats a disappointing way to exit the tournament when you not only lose the match but you lose a little faith in your fellow competitor
6469284 playing in the olympics in whats supposed to be considered a gentlemans sport thats a time to call it on yourself
6469285 fernando looked me square in the eye and didnt call it

6469297 i proved that i played with the best tonight and it couldnt have happened to me on a better stage
6469298 being down two match points and the other guys serve youre never really feeling good
6469299 but looking back i might have needed a tough match like this
6469300 i saw that and i dont know if thats a game hes completely comfortable with
6469301 i knew if i could make him play stick to that game i probably had a decent shot at the breaker
6469302 now if people are interested because they heard something happened i guess its a positive i could go out and play a clean match and people will ask why i didnt get mad
6469303 just trying to enjoy 100 percent the experience and later try my best on court
6469304 i feel really good about the match not a lot of unforced errors no service breaks

6469335 this case raises first amendment issues that are for the courts to decide not my client dynadot
6469336 the only agreement by dynadot was to comply with the courts previous order to preserve evidence including preventing wikileaks from transferring its domain name to another registrar and from changing its account settings essentially to preserve the status quo dynadot did not agree to remove the name server settings for wikileaks org or to produce any information this was requested by julius baer and granted by the court
6469337 lock the wikileaks org domain name to prevent transfer of the domain name to a different domain registrar
6469338 its like saying that time magazine published one page of sensitive material so someone can seize the entire magazine and put a lock on their presses
6469339 the order was entirely written by cayman islands bank julius baer lawyers and was accepted by judge white without amendment or representations by wikileaks or amicus
6469340 there are serious questions of prior restraint and possible violations of the first amendment
6469341 the court has serious questions whether those concerns raised before the court make the granting of the relief requested by the plaintiffs constitutionally appropriate
6469342 the court has serious questions about the effectiveness of any order this court might issue given the current state of affairs that these matters are fully out in the public domain in the virtual domain

6469378 non les fran ais ont t frapp s parce quils repr sentent une nouvelle force internationale dans cette r gion leur prise de commandement a t m diatis e le mouvement taliban est tr s moderne tr s inform on a d j vu des agressions similaires quand dautres nations ont augment leur contingent les insurg s se sont donn comme objectif de frapper un grand coup pour branler lopinion publique dans ces pays et forcer un retrait les espagnols d ploy s en irak en ont fait les frais en 2004 comme les britanniques dans la province du helmand en afghanistan
6469379 la centrale talibane sest reconstitu e apr s sa d capitation en d cembre 2001 elle sest r organis e pendant 3 ou 4 ans au pakistan le mouvement sest durci dans la clandestinit et professionnalis on la vraiment constat au printemps 2006 o il y a eu une explosion des violences
6469380 parall lement on sent une fatigue une morosit de la population qui ne voit pas les b n fices de la reconstruction dans les p riph ries afghanes les campagnes peu a chang le gouvernement est moins populaire cest plus facile pour les talibans dinfiltrer ces zones de dormir dans un village la veille dune attaque
6469381 quand on dit cela on ne voit que le volet militaire il faut deux autres volets le dans lequel des choses bougent et l conomique un des enjeux est par exemple de faire du d veloppement dans des zones instables les ong ont peur dy aller donc les militaires les remplacent mais il faudrait y installer des acteurs plus neutres le gros probl me cest la coordination entre les nations unies lotan les ong le gouvernement en outre il y a lop ration enduring freedom des am ricains lanc e l poque pour trouver ben laden les etats unis la m nent en parall le sans quon sache exactement ce quils font si les acteurs taient coordonn s la guerre dafghanistan pourrait tre gagn e

6469383 ce serait dramatique toutes les composantes de linsurrection prendraient chacune des territoires les talibans durs nont pas r ussi imposer une id ologie tous ils ne prendraient pas le pouvoir comme le vietcong au vietnam par exemple actuellement 90 des insurg s agissent par opposition au gouvernement une tribu qui sestime marginalis e un trafiquant de drogue qui veut contr ler une vall e en cas de retrait ce serait la guerre civile on reviendrait aux ann es 93 94 chaque village son arm e etc on pourrait se dire que ce nest pas grave vu de france mais les talibans durs au pakistan notamment crieraient victoire dans les m dias et cela renforcerait leur campagne de terrorisme international
6469384 les acteurs cherchent se coordonner cest dur d tre optimiste mais il y a des op rations de stabilisation qui r ussissent localement mais on nen parle pas pour viter quelles ne deviennent dattaques cest le r sultat du courage dong dune politique de cooptation du gouvernement la recette est connue ce qui est dur cest de lappliquer la question cest avons nous encore le temps les talibans se sont organis s on naura pas de bons r sultats avant 5 ou 10 ans

6469403 important that voters be confident that mccain is backed up by an experienced and qualified vice president prepared to step in and do the exact opposite about everything except iraq
6469404 capable of dumping everything he has ever believed in and assuring the anti choice anti union anti government folk that he is on their team
6469405 all those issues pretty much every single domestic issue on which lieberman and mccain have voted on opposite sides
6469406 lieberman for vp chatter is more serious than some think
6469407 i n one fell swoop mccain could lower that number by quite a bit if he picked just one of the two sitting senators who actually ran against bush as a democrat
6469408 lieberman would make a fine secretary of state and that given the political risks making him vice president would probably be too great an election gamble

6469453 the 2009 iowa state kansas state game will be our 14th division i a college football game at arrowhead
6469454 this was something founder lamar hunt envisioned when arrowhead was built and we are excited to continue hosting college football at a new and renovated arrowhead in 2009 and 2010 i want to thank athletic directors jamie pollard of iowa state and bob krause of k state for their efforts in putting this together we wish both universities the very best in their growing football programs

6469458 i had politely stated in the spirit of fair mindedness to the other candidate what they were doing was improper and probably not legal
6469459 three months passed and my complaint fell on deaf ears
6469460 had violated state laws by allowing an incumbent school board member to campaign and place placards on their equipment for public exposure
6469461 the state told me that she locke atkins called with a complaint and that i should go over there and tell kathy that she could not be doing that
6469462 were campaign cards there were no placards on the computers there were no vote for dixie signs there was none of that just cards which is not right she prater shouldnt have been doing that
6469463 if there were seven people running for one office wed have seven cards thats not just this office every office up here has done that
6469464 a lady had been complaining about dixie having some cards out in the window
6469465 i said to the clerk did you tell her that mr allison is more than welcome to bring his cards up here too and she said that she had
6469466 there wasnt anything mentioned to me about it being illegal or anything like that
6469467 weve been doing it allowing the cards for 18 years
6469468 its not always been that way but you can now turn in a registration to vote here to the register of deeds office i am assuming that is when the law changed when we became a registering agency
6469469 maam i wasnt aware of anything you didnt contact me you contacted the state i didnt know until you contacted the state
6469470 if it were truly about did i do something i wasnt suppose to do was i aware of it no i was not but the thing id like to say is if this was all about getting the cards out of the window and telling me i had done something wrong it would have been nice to have gotten that from the election commission that day of the original complaint and it wouldnt have looked so orchestrated to come out a day before the election
6469471 i am absolutely thrilled that keri anne and cassie took the silver and bronze medals in the new open water swim event congratulations what a marathon what a fantastic achievement this is a real credit to the world class training programme provided at grand central my congratulations to all involved

6469475 the problem for smaller suppliers is exacerbated because they are often under pressure to settle their own bills quickly to secure goods and supplies essential to their business
6469476 the scale of late payments has grown in value yet again despite companies investing a significant amount of time and money to secure the demise of the problem

6469481 i dont think theres any doubt the major major issue is water and can be as important as oil so the compact that is in effect obviously needs to be renegotiated over time amongst the interested parties
6469482 i think that theres a movement amongst the governors to try if not quote renegotiate certainly adjust to the new realities of high growth of greater demands on a scarcer resource
6469483 senator mccain believes as i do that a compact thats been worked out between the governors and between the states is the right way to go states are the ones who build these kinds of understandings the federal government shouldnt meddle in that compact
6469484 were going to know over the next year whether the colorado compact is an interest for the governors
6469485 it cant be washington that says the time is right to open the compact
6469486 its got to be we in the region saying were having trouble with this or that and therefore

6469517 how about you be my heir prince or princess is a lot better than servant or slave
6469518 when redeemed by christ you are no longer a slave but a son and since you are a son god has made you also an heir
6469519 now if we are children then we are heirs heirs of god and co heirs with christ if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory
6469520 but when the kindness and love of god our savior appeared he saved us not because of righteous things we had done but because of his mercy he saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the holy spirit whom he poured out on us generously through jesus christ our savior so that having been justified by his grace we might become heirs having the hope of eternal life

6469666 there are serious flaws in the nss and the approach it embodies but it is a document which offers all things to all readers while being strangely unable to provide much in the way of vision leadership and motivation or strategy in other words the nss refers to the uks core values human rights the rule of law legitimate and accountable government justice freedom tolerance and opportunity for all but these values are mentioned in a strangely passive and defensive way almost as if the most that should be done with these immense ideas is to protect them from marauding terrorists and criminals and of course to stop them being ruined by flood water saddest of all these values appear to constitute little more than the normality to which we are told the governments security strategy will enable us to return as soon as possible after some harm occurs

6469832 confine himself as far as i can to personal religion pure and simple
6469833 the only recent comparable example of entertainers venturing into such serious cultural political territory is penn amp tellers showtime series bullshit which skewers sacred cows from a skeptical libertarian perspective

6469836 the basic concept has maher traveling around the world talking to believers about what they believe and most importantly why or how they can believe it for that matter
6469837 thats where i think the movie succeeds the most but also one of the main places where detractors will come after it

6469854 we won three straight last october ive tried to teach our guys that successful teams do it over the course of 4 or 5 months they certainly understand what it takes and how quickly it can be taken away from you
6469855 its about focusing on the process if you can learn that the wins take care of itself everybody wants to quantify what a successful season is if these guys can achieve competitive greatness give themselves opportunities to win games theyre going to win more than their share

6469858 when we came here they laughed at us when we walked around campus right now theres a little buzz you can just feel the energy around us there are a lot of expectations we cant wait to get started
6469859 you see the predictions you just try not to read into that too much it would mean so much to leave on a good note especially after all the things weve been through i couldnt even put that into words

6469863 si venezuela no reconociera la existencia del estado de israel no podr a permitir que hubiese un embajador israel en caracas
6469864 fue siempre el pueblo jud o y los jud os del mundo que tienen el derecho como cualquier otro grupo humano a su existencia
6469865 he ordenado retirar nuestro embajador de israel porque en verdad causa indignaci n ver como el estado de israel sigue atropellando bombardeando asesinando descuartizando con los aviones gringos que tiene y con el alto poder militar que tienen con el apoyo de los estados unidos a tantos inocentes

6469869 en tono grato y cordial que permiti plantear las luchas de nuestro pueblos el renacimiento de am rica latina los mejores valores de la solidaridad y la vida
6469870 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
6469871 you follow it up to almost standing on top of the cache
6469872 as a kid i was always interested in pirate treasure and buried treasure

6469875 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances
6469876 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6469877 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6469878 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6469879 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre

6469885 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6469886 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
6469887 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6469888 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6469889 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6469890 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6469891 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
6469892 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
6469893 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
6469894 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6469895 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6469896 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6469897 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6469898 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6469899 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6469900 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6469901 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6469902 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6469903 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6469904 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6469905 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6469906 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6469907 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6469908 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6469909 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6469910 protocolo espec fico adicional sobre recursos h dricos compartidos entre la rep blica de chile y la rep blica argentina

6469912 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6469913 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto

6469916 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6469917 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6469918 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6469919 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6469920 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6469921 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6469922 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales

6469926 the fundamentals underlying the dollars bear market have not changed one iota the financial crisis continues unabated as you can see from the major hits financial stocks have taken recently big names like wachovia jp morgan and even goldman sachs financial institutions whose share prices have plunged as much as 12 from recent highs moreover more bad loan write offs are coming julys home foreclosures jumped an astounding 55 while actual property seizures by banks surged 184 most of the losses that will come from julys terrible real estate market have not yet been reflected in write offs so far financial institutions have lost an estimated 500 billion even the conservative international monetary fund imf says theres another 500 billion in losses to be recognized so at best the crisis is only half way over that tells me that the fed and treasury will have to pump more money into the economy and bail out more institutions it also means that the federal budget deficit is likely to explode even higher than the current estimate of a record 500 billion for 2009 as tax receipts fall and spending is ramped up
6469927 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months

6469934 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6469935 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano

6469939 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6469940 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6469941 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6469942 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6469943 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible

6469946 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6469947 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana

6469949 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
6469950 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
6469951 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6469952 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6469953 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
6469954 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6469955 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
6469956 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
6469957 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
6469958 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6469959 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6469960 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6469961 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6469962 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6469963 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6469964 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6469965 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6469966 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6469967 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6469968 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6469969 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6469970 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6469971 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta

6469974 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6469975 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior

6469977 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6469978 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
