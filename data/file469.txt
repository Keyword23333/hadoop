4690000 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4690001 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4690002 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4690003 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4690004 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4690005 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4690006 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4690007 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4690008 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4690009 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4690010 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4690011 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4690012 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4690013 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4690014 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4690015 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4690016 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4690017 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4690018 when you walk in the front door and check in you can expect to have pretty much the same experience that people had when they gathered here for a vacation 140 years ago
4690019 when people are booking reservations these are things they ask for
4690020 i dont think these are requests we can ignore but i think we can make these additions without changing the character the ambience of the hotel
4690021 if we were to go in and add insulation and everything else that goes with adding a heating system we would completely change the soul the character of the old building
4690022 preservation of this 132 year old marvel of a building is an ongoing process
4690023 we fell in love with her so many years ago and are delighted her welfare will continue with bob mullocks leadership
4690024 people come to cape may for the history of the town and the people who choose to stay here understand that where they are staying is as important as the destination
4690025 create an authentic experience here that has nothing to do with the outside world and theyre doing that in a very organic way that isnt contrived
4690026 people always say they feel like theyre coming home when they come here to stay
4690027 i would not be surprised if some ethnic minorities in china were offended by this but they are also accustomed to it
4690028 in the west we are obsessed with authenticity in such matters but its different in china id guess many chinese would not have a problem with it
4690029 i see nothing wrong exactly with where the children are from it is a tradition in china in terms of giving a performance
4690030 the other hotels around the area all have health care that is provided by the boss and have been able to get wage increases
4690031 at the other hotels in the same classification for the same work the workers get paid 2 to 3 an hour more
4690032 clearly were disappointed that unite here local 681 has spent more time protesting
4690033 publicity stunts are not productive and are extremely disruptive to the resort district
4690034 disneyland is being unfair with us because were fighting for our health care and theyre trying to take it away
4690035 theyre trying to cut our hours and take away our seniority
4690036 the most important is health care we need that and they want to take it away
4690037 but the fact remains they are untested and we have doubts whether pakistan could deliver on those plans
4690038 getting eight teams around to training and games in two centres is a massive logistical exercise and with the current situation there i dont know if the military could handle it
4690039 our guys listened patiently and asked some very pertinent questions i thought but i didnt get the impression that any of them were convinced about the safety of the situation
4690040 he competido con tres generaciones de atletas rusos y con los mejores marchadores del mundo durante los ltimos doce a os ahora ha llegado el momento de dar el testigo a una nueva generaci n de marchadores latinoamericanos que tienen que asumir la responsabilidad
4690041 habl demasiado y demasiado pronto no tuve un desvanecimiento pero s un fuerte dolor en la espalda a la altura de las v as respiratorias se organiz un buen revuelo pero en cuanto los m dicos me miraron y me dejaron reposar un poco se pas el dolor

4690073 un debate parlamentario le obligar a hacer expl cito lo que permanec a impl cito en su discurso que considera un error la inclusi n de ese compromiso en el estatuto es decir poner fecha a una obligaci n imposible de garantizar por adelantado pues pod a no alcanzarse un acuerdo pol tico y adem s ese acuerdo bilateral deb a ser compatible con el acuerdo del conjunto de las autonom as

4690076 suena a juego sucio contra jos montilla que desde el psoe se le recuerden los valores constitucionales de la solidaridad y la igualdad cuando lo cierto es que las reclamaciones financieras del gobierno catal n tienen el sustento leal del estatuto y el impulso pol tico de los compromisos personales de rodr guez zapatero

4690088 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4690089 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4690090 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4690091 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4690092 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4690093 this is a planning took where all things are going
4690094 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4690095 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4690096 makeup is a wonderful tool to enhance your look but used correctly it should never look fake or like youre wearing a mask

4690106 i wanted you to see what real courage is instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand its when you know youre licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what you rarely win but sometimes you do
4690107 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4690108 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4690109 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4690110 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4690111 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4690112 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4690113 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4690114 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4690115 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4690116 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4690117 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4690118 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4690119 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4690120 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4690121 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4690122 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4690123 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4690124 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4690125 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4690126 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4690127 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4690128 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4690129 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4690130 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4690131 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4690132 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4690133 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4690134 barman how much is it for pint and half of keo two red bulls and four vodkas
4690135 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4690136 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4690137 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4690138 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4690139 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4690140 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4690141 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4690142 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4690143 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4690144 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4690145 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4690146 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4690147 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4690148 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4690149 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4690150 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4690151 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4690152 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4690153 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4690154 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4690155 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4690156 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4690157 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4690158 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4690159 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4690160 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4690161 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4690162 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4690163 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4690164 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4690165 beforehand bob his coach said it would be good for me if i lost when he said that i was fired up i said im going to go for it and when i saw that finish i said wow
4690166 i still cant believe that we came back and won that match
4690167 but i was thinking it would be a pretty gnarly comeback if we make the comeback
4690168 i saw myself leading 9 4 10 6 11 8 you look at the score it was 6 0 and now its 7 all its hard to believe even now
4690169 our guys listened patiently and asked some very pertinent questions but i didnt get the impression that any of them were convinced about the safety of the situation
4690170 but the fact remains they are untested and we have doubts whether pakistan could deliver on those plans
4690171 especially because we had to go 120 minutes brazil only needed to play 90
4690172 but its not going to be an easy match no matter what
4690173 hopefully it wont make a difference that we had to play 120 minutes
4690174 its going to come down to details which ever team is able to perform better at the time will come away with the victory
4690175 silver is silver i once heard an athlete say that his silver tasted like gold

4690180 washington reuters a u s appeals court on tuesday dismissed former
4690181 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4690182 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4690183 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4690184 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4690185 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4690186 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4690187 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4690188 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4690189 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4690190 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4690191 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4690192 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4690193 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4690194 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4690195 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4690196 where does your authority to question the highest court in the land come from
4690197 i am a thinker i dont need authority i think so i question

4690202 christenen moeten nu goed opletten de reformatie zei alleen door de schrift en niet de openbaring van god in christus alleen als je niet de kijk op de schriften hebt die de reformatoren hadden heb je echt geen inhoud voor het woord christus en dat is het geval binnen de moderne trend in de theologie moderne theologie gebruikt het woord zonder inhoud omdat christus is losgesneden van de schriften de reformatie volgde het onderwijs van christus zelf door de openbaring die christus van god gaf te verbinden aan de openbaring van de geschreven schriften
4690203 in 2003 verscheen klukhuhns grote boek de geschiedenis van het denken dat een heuse filosofiebestseller werd alle mensen heten janus is de langverwachte opvolger van dit boek en het is in alle opzichten een uitgebreide en verbeterde editie
4690204 een belangrijk deel van wat in janus aan de orde wordt gesteld is al eens in een voorlopiger vorm gepubliceerd de inhoud van eerdere boeken hypothese sterf en de geschiedenis is in janus opgezogen als inkt in een spons wat ook het geval was met hypothese in sterf met sterf in de geschiedenis en nu dus eens temeer daarom is janus te beschouwen als de vierde fase van een project waarvan het definitieve einde waarschijnlijk nooit in zich zal komen laat staan zal worden bereikt

4690207 we played like we wanted to win we played together
4690208 we were very aware of their offensive sets we were very aware of their personnel and we played like that so we were kind of a step in front of what they wanted to do because we kind of knew everything already
4690209 any time you get beat its embarrassing and thats enough
4690210 and we can really use that as a tool to help us with our defense now and thats the name of the game because if you play good defense no matter how youre shooting the ball youre going to be in the game

4690231 yang menjadi masalah adalah pertumbuhan ekonomi yang disampaikan pemerintah belum diikuti dengan pengurangan kemiskinan dan pengangguran jadi istilahnya pertumbuhan kita belum sepenuhnya berkualitas pemerintah hingga saat ini belum menemukan jurus untuk menanggulangi kemiskinan dan pengangguran
4690232 diversifikasi sumber pertumbuhan ekonomi tidak lagi pada ekspor yang basisnya komiditi atau konsumsi masyarakat kita harus menggantinya dengan basis investasi yang sifatnya domestik pertumbuhan dengan dasar investasi ini akan menyerap tenaga kerja lebih banyak sedangkan untuk sektor manufaktur juga harus dibangkitkan kembali kemarin ini kita bisa survive karena sektor komoditi tapi itu tidak selamanya karena fluktuatif harganya begitu harga turun semua orang ribut
4690233 dengan kondisi kita berhadapan dengan ketidakpastian harga minyak harga komoditi yang juga luar biasa toh pertumbuhan kita perkiraannya masih mendekati 6 persen saat ini jadi tahun depan dengan kondisi yang semoga lebih stabil harusnya lebih tinggi pertumbuhan ekonomi cuma mungkin agak terganggu dengan pemilu

4690261 a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interest
4690262 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4690263 its clearly a very emotional time but i think that it should still be seen that this was a productive day i hope now that peace can return to georgia and georgians can return to a normal life
4690264 we wanted to make our kids a little bit better
4690265 we went to unl university of nebraska lincoln and talked with their strength and conditioning coach kevin dobson from that we planned a new summer conditioning program
4690266 you can tell the ones who go through the summer conditioning program
4690267 you can see their commitment level it shows in their strength and their foot work
4690268 you have to fight through all the elements that there are in a real game so it prepares you for everything you re about to experience
4690269 i cramp up easily so i drink a lot of water and pedialyte that is for kids and ice is always good for your muscles too
4690270 you always want to stretch after practice so you don t wake up in the morning and can barely walk

4690284 we wanted to make our kids a little bit better
4690285 we went to unl university of nebraska lincoln and talked with their strength and conditioning coach kevin dobson from that we planned a new summer conditioning program
4690286 we did a lot of different things this summer and i think it s going to pay off
4690287 it s vital that kids participate in summer conditioning going into two a days those kids are less susceptible to injuries
4690288 you can tell the ones who go through the summer conditioning program
4690289 you can see their commitment level it shows in their strength and their foot work
4690290 in the old days two a days was used to get players back into shape but now we need players to stay in shape all year so that we can work on fundamentals and techniques during two a days
4690291 kids now stay in shape better because a lot of them play two or three or four different sports
4690292 they have to stay in shape they have no choice but we also like that when these students play other sports they keep competing they keep that edge
4690293 a lot of them are good about drinking good fluids we want them to stay away from soda and drink a lot of water with that the kids have to get sleep and rest it all works together
4690294 it doesn t matter if they re in a game or in two a days or in regular practice
4690295 the threat is always there hopefully in an organized athletic program we can minimize the injuries
4690296 coming into the fall sports we look at things more critically because the kids are coming off their summer breaks
4690297 we stress that they continue strength training and conditioning during the summer we make it available we don t make it mandatory but we do try to provide incentives
4690298 athletes who stay hydrated are less likely to fatigue when the body fatigues it s more susceptible to injury
4690299 i remember when the coaches wouldn t let you drink any water until after practice was over
4690300 the coaches are much better now and know what they re doing
4690301 we watch the nutrition have you ever gotten a cramp we make sure he eats lots of bananas and drinks lots of water
4690302 i ve been trying to get him to do extra conditioning
4690303 plenty of rest plenty of sleep maybe a protein shake to keep him going
4690304 he s a lot better than i ever was but he s got a lot of work ahead of him he needs to stay out of trouble and keep his grades up he just needs to concentrate on high school and high school football now
4690305 he s pretty athletic likes the competition and likes football
4690306 it s kept him out of trouble and with good kids he hangs out with a pretty good group of friends
4690307 we have four kids so it s running all the time

4690346 hubert humphrey won the nomination but the democratic party was still divided particularly because vice president humphrey did not disassociate himself from johnsons vietnam war policy i too opposed the war but wanting to get a democrat in the white house i stuffed many humphrey for president leaflets under apartment doors that fall
4690347 it is necessary to disrupt the status quo that is the tradition of our country our founders were disrupters magnificent disrupters martin luther king jr was a disrupter as were the suffragettes it is the american way the change that resulted from these leaders has made our country greater how can we follow their lead
4690348 people always ask arent you scared and i say just strike that word from your vocabulary this is not for the faint of heart you cant be afraid you have a vision knowledge a plan you have support this is what you believe in if you show one cent of being afraid your options are destroyed so you have to believe in what you are doing and you may not win every fight but you will advance the cause
4690349 the challenges of success as well as the lessons of failure organize dont agonize politics is not for the faint of heart dont let me give you this impression that people are waiting with open arms to pull you into power nobody nobody ever in the history of the world has given away power
4690350 let me say that washington dc is a city that is wedded to the status quo change is not what they are about and as a leader i say you must be kidding the city is wedded to the special interests because they all make a living perpetuating the status quo its the special interests not the peoples interest and that is why it was so important if i may have a moment of partisan enjoyment that we won the last election i have become the speaker of the house not because i mastered the inside of things but because i am an outsider and i want change to happen here
4690351 well throw you a crumb and well keep the status quo that is not the american way our founders in this city where it all started they were disrupters sometimes you wonder why you have to go to such lengths to convince people of the obvious about the future
4690352 we have a foreign policy question the actual question is do you think we should blockade iran
4690353 i think we should ask a broader question do you think there is a desire and a plan on the part of this administration to engage iran
4690354 iran keeps insisting that they want to proceed on developing nuclear power they say for domestic use we suspect they have other motives they cannot be allowed to do this
4690355 a lot of technology from china from pakistan probably from russia and other places and that should never have happened
4690356 i hope for the best in terms of iran i suspect the worst
4690357 the last resort consequences of preventive military action against iran
4690358 fears that it would prompt a rally round the flag effect in iran
4690359 u s is respected for its commitment to multilateral diplomacy
4690360 but i dont think anything can be accomplished by going into iran to stop them from developing weapons of mass destruction because that would only galvanize the country around the leadership thats a b we may not accomplish our goal they may have parallel program where we think we got it but we didnt get it or we got part of it and we didnt get the rest and what have we accomplished in terms of world opinion at the same time
4690361 what we should be doing and theyre trying to do this more but we should have been doing it more robust and sooner is to say to iran dont even think about having a weapon of mass destruction and were galvanizing world international global forces diplomatically economically culturally financially economically to pass sanctions to tighten and tighten and tighten if you proceed down this course
4690362 the president of iran has said i have friends well if those friends want to be friends with iran then we cant have them be friends of ours because our foreign policy is that we cannot permit proliferation of weapons of mass destruction
4690363 you cant be friends with me if youre friends with them
4690364 and let me just say this war in iraq has been a horrendous dilemna a grotesque mistake
4690365 they went into that war knowing full well there was no intelligence to support the imminent threat that this administration was contending i was a senior democrat on the intelligence committee at the time its called the gang of four the top democrats and the top republicans in the house and in the senate and we saw all of the intelligence and there was no intelligence to say that there was an imminent threat of weapons of mass destruction from iraq it was clear i voted against the war i had all the intelligence and i knew the threat wasnt there so this administration knew all this faulty intelligence stuff they knew it wasnt there
4690366 i applaud the presidents focusing on this issue and on taking the lead to disarm saddam hussein
4690367 yes he has chemical weapons he has biological weapons and he is trying to get nuclear weapons
4690368 i would imagine its those feelings in iraq that led to this next question are you going to allow a motion to impeach president bush to come to the floor
4690369 and this all occurs before the election in 2004 where was the outrage why do you think the democrats lost in 2004
4690370 the search is for truth the search is for truth to take our country in the direction of our founders with their magnificent disruption we have to continue in the tradition of the magnificent disruption and one way for that to happen is for women to know their power
4690371 you were briefed about torture and the wiretapping years before the public found out why didnt you use your power to stop it
4690372 you were briefed as a member of the gang of four about torture in 2002 and as the gang of eight about wiretapping
4690373 not these kind of questions were not taking these kinds of questions youre done
4690374 why dont you use the power the constitution granted you to stop a president who abuses his powers

4690402 how it will go this year will depend on the how our offense and defense line develops

4690404 hand and eye coordination learning our plays on defense and offense and just molding together as a team
4690405 but we are returning fifteen lettermen we had so many injuries so many things that effected us last year so we had a lot of kids get playing time and experience and hopefully that carries over this year

4690410 before coming to the set it was a little bit nerve wracking because i knew i was working with a legend and i didnt know what the expectations were of me but with dolphy he was very down to earth he can talk to anyone and he actually really helped me how to internalize
4690411 he helped me see what it would be really like to be his daughter he really took the time to tell me to imagine and be the role he really helped me a lot and he made me feel really comfortable on the set because i was really scared at first
4690412 when i first found out id be doing the project i didnt know how big my role was if it was going to be another cameo role pero when i found out i was the leading lady i was kind of shocked i said wow howd i manage to get that
4690413 apparently the director and tito dolphy saw me in the big brother house then they discussed it and then they asked bossing vic and they all thought i could do the role
4690414 luckily they had a lot of faith in me it only took me usually one take for it surprisingly
4690415 i know dolphy is a living icon not only in this generation but even in my grandparents generation and my parents generation i found bossing vic to be really nice too i talked to him about my experiences on pbb
4690416 hes really nice to talk to he helped me with the delivery of my lines the reactions and even pronunciations in tagalog in fact the first filipino movie i watched was his movie ano ba yan back in 1995
4690417 hes quite charming and i think most women like a guy with a good sense of humor its very attractive to meet someone whos intelligent and witty so i think thats part of the allure that he has
4690418 she is an inspiration to me not a distraction shes my inspiration to do well in my job
4690419 ondanks haar inbedding in een systeem van vooruitgangsdenken dat uiteindelijk tot meer en meer individuele vrijheid en democratie geleid heeft is de wetenschap zelf geen democratisch systeem het is een meritocratie waarin de invloed die iemand heeft bepaald wordt door de diensten die hij heeft bewezen aan de doelen van de gemeenschap iedereen heeft wel een stem maar sommige stemmen zijn veel meer waard dan die van anderen
4690420 zelfreflectie van een soort dat verder gaat dan de kritieken van popper en kuhn in elk geval op drie punten hoe bepaal je wat wetenschap is hoe communiceer je resultaten en hoe ga je om met belangen daar heeft de wetenschap intern wel een antwoord op maar dat is niet genoeg verloren maatschappelijk gezag valt in deze tijd alleen te heroveren als het in samenspraak met die maatschappij tot stand komt dus buiten de wetenschappelijke kaders
4690421 een sterkere betrokkenheid van de wetenschap bij maatschappelijke fenomenen die zelf niet wetenschappelijk zijn met als oogmerk wetenschap en maatschappij dichter bij elkaar te betrekken
4690422 mee te buigen met de tijdgeest kon ze gezaghebbend blijven

4690478 that was the difference if i had glided i would have lost i guess im blessed
4690479 the one thing that really fired me up beforehand cavic said it would be good for him and good for swimming if he won
4690480 im at a loss for words i had no idea the race was that close i was lucky enough to get my hands on the wall first
4690481 i thought in the perfect circumstances i could do it
4690482 i never thought you were out of that race that is a tribute to your greatness were so proud of you i am happy to keep company with you

4690500 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4690501 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4690502 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4690503 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4690511 neither is it that us foreign policy is cruel because american leaders are cruel its that our leaders are cruel because only those willing to be inordinately cruel and remorseless can hold positions of leadership in the foreign policy establishment it might as well be written into the job description people capable of expressing a full human measure of compassion and empathy toward faraway powerless strangers let alone american soldiers do not become president of the united states or vice president or secretary of state or national security adviser or secretary of the treasury nor do they want to

4690548 i would say that hes not completely out of the picture still
4690549 hes a fugitive and hes probably seeking refugee status and the thai attorney general would have to prove hes not a refugee and he doesnt deserve to have refugee status and that will be a legal process that will become a political issue in the near future
4690550 well indeed escape to england this time has turned thaksin into a political martyr which will serve to maintain the strength of his party
4690551 my guess is that the samak government will survive for quite a long time much longer than many people suspect
4690552 moscow must honor its commitment to withdraw its invading forces from all georgian territory
4690553 the cold war is over the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us
4690554 obviously more of this water will be traversable in more parts of the year so we want to find it before hollywood
4690555 its very exciting its like an indiana jones adventure its searching for a lost under water tomb
4690556 our objective is to find and protect the wreck because they are in danger of being found by people who dont have the know how and the same intention and preoccupation that we have
4690557 for the first time in over 160 years i feel that the witnesses of the franklin tragedy events have a chance to really contribute to an important search party
4690558 we feel that nepal has found its hero for any epoch changing society we need a hero
4690559 after europes capitalist revolution napoleon came along to institutionalise socialism in russia lenin appeared in nepal to institutionalise the federal democratic republic after 10 years of peoples war and mass popular movement pranchanda is here
4690560 we have already finished destroying the roots of feudalism in nepal under the leadership of prachanda the main agenda of the new administration will be nationalism republicanism economic and social transformation
4690561 the integration of the peoples liberation army into the nepal army will see lots of arguments and counter arguments the way they deal with the army is very crucial
4690562 the maoists will try to bring in populist and radical economic reforms but financially they will have lots of constraints
4690563 he is a communist hardliner but now he has a responsibility to meet the standards of democratic principles
4690564 this is an acid test for him to prove his commitment to democracy
4690565 at this rate reconstruction will last 10 years and a generation of our citizens of our children will be raised in inequality because they live in huts and have nowhere to study
4690566 by hosting these poland is making itself a target this is 100 per cent certain it becomes a target for attack such targets are destroyed as a first priority
4690567 it clearly states that we can use nuclear weapons against the countries possessing nuclear weapons against allies of such countries if they somehow support them and against those countries which deploy other countries nuclear weapons on their territories poland is aware of it
4690568 a resolution that represents anything other than the will of the zimbabwean people would be a disaster for our country
4690569 we agree with the mediation but we dont think that people who are in these negotiations should be attending as if they have won an election
4690570 i dont think you can control all the world from one centre
4690571 there are big nations there are huge populations there is unbelievable economic development in some parts of the world so what we have to do is instead of unilateral actions act all together make common decisions and have consultations with the world a new world order if i can say it should emerge
4690572 there are so many important issues like the nuclear issue iraq the caucasus afghanistan
4690573 iran is definitely having some influence of these issues so we are talking
4690574 we dont want to see weapons of mass destruction in this region
4690575 if its in our neighbourhood we definitely dont want to see it
4690576 i dont want to think about that everybody should take a lesson from what happened in iraq
4690577 i wish to see turkey as an island where the european standard of democracy is being fulfilled and the free market economy is functioning very well
4690578 this will be a real gift to the region to the world for peace and this turkey will be a source of inspiration for so many
4690579 as we are transforming ourselves in that direction we will not forget our natural links and relationships and advantages with other countries muslim countries central asian countries caucasus countries middle eastern and other countries
4690580 turkey is having a positive impact on them spreading the values of democracy freedom rule of law also the economic changes here are admired maybe that is the indirect influence of this country
4690581 in the last two years we spent our energy on domestic issues and the reforms slowed down
4690582 now after the court case there is a new era this is a big opportunity for turkey everybody realises that reforms are necessary
4690583 turkey has great capacity to influence the region indirectly very peacefully being an inspiration for changes turkey has been playing this role already this has not been appreciated enough
4690584 europe should realise that turkey can do more for the stability and security of the region
4690585 start with the caucasus last month the problem was not serious but suddenly we found ourselves in a war situation
4690586 europe should encourage turkey and not create some artificial problems during the negotiation process with us some member countries or some politicians should not mix domestic issues and strategic issues domestic issues are conjunctural today its there and tomorrow its not but the strategic issues are always there and we cannot sacrifice strategic issues for domestic issues unfortunately nowadays we see this kind of shortsighted policies in some countries
4690587 some call it terror some call it the south east problem some call it the kurdish problem whatever you call it we will find a solution
4690588 there are other problems secularism and anti secularism those things will also find solutions in this climate that is why i focus on the reform process the problem was this the lack of democracy the standard of democracy that was creating problems not only in the south east but in other issues that is when we upgrade the standards these problems will find solutions
4690589 but having a good relationship helps the stability of the region
4690590 everyone has to learn so that they can one day teach
4690591 duizenden ze citeren het cijfer dat ze op de russische radio hebben gehoord die mythologisering draagt niet bij tot een blijvende vrede

4690597 well if i turned it on myself how come i need to have my administrator turn it off
4690598 the user name is ad hyphen temp so that is a d hyphen t e m p
4690599 well why dont you just go and engineer yourself a solution
4690600 can you copy over the c windows system32 drivers folder from a working thinkpad t42 to machine id xxxx
4690601 well i was trying to troubleshoot a hibernation problem on my laptop and so i deleted the drivers folder because i thought it was related to a driver problem now my computer wont boot
4690602 and sir we have disabled hibernation on all the company laptops so thats why hibernate doesnt work
4690603 it is in truth not for glory nor riches nor honours that we are fighting but for freedom for that alone which no honest man gives up but with life itself

4690605 i think no doubt whats happening at gatineau will be encouraging
4690606 our priority is to continue to run an efficient operation to ensure that we can fulfill our commitment to provide customers the everyday low prices they expect from wal mart
4690607 u s workers continue to wait to get the same respect from wal mart
4690608 if higher wages better benefits and fair treatment are incompatible with way of doing business its time for the company to change which is what wal mart watch has been saying all along

4690613 although the board were unable to state categorically that the fatal wounds were fired from an armoured support company viking the weight of evidence suggests it is possible that this was a blue on blue friendly fire incident
4690614 the film could easily be seen to portray good as a weakness used and repeatedly exploited by evil
4690615 the movie was visually and viscerally stunning but deeply disturbing even diabolic
4690616 as sick and scary as that scenario the jokers description of his scars is it is nevertheless one with which a great many of todays youth deeply scarred internally will easily identify as they too have been subjected to domestic violence
4690617 seeing the film only a few days after the very disturbing and unexplainable beheading of a passenger on a canadian bus i could not help wonder if the perpetrator had seen the batman film
4690618 oh my the murder of an innocent man by a psychologically disturbed man is being linked to the joker thats a pretty big non sequitur and a gigantic post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy if ive ever seen one
4690619 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4690620 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did

4690623 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4690624 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4690625 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4690626 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4690627 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4690628 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4690629 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4690630 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4690631 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

4690633 to teach you a lesson we are not emptying the bins in the street
4690634 if this issue of terrorism is not addressed all the good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated
4690635 we will not be able to pursue the peace initiatives we want to take
4690636 its beautiful to be helping with such a worthy cause
4690637 what i really took away from that moment was seeing the smiles on their faces from the transformation from the small change we were able to make

4690878 when you turn away the colour follows you its incredibly charged with life and an inner light makinti has always been a great colourist and this work is incredibly beautiful
4690879 for a long time makinti has been acknowledged in the kintore community as the number one artist
4690880 lets not walk away from it the telstra art awards are a time for debate and discussion about aboriginal art and the creators of that art
4690881 thats appropriate and its also healthy the strength of the telstra awards will always be the fact that strong ideas and views can and will be debated about the art itself the art market and marketing ethics
4690882 18 u s c 953 private correspondence with foreign governments any citizen of the united states wherever he may be who without authority of the united states directly or indirectly commences or carries on any correspondence or intercourse with any foreign government or any officer or agent thereof with intent to influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer or agent thereof in relation to any disputes or controversies with the united states or to defeat the measures of the united states shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years or both this section shall not abridge the right of a citizen to apply himself or his agent to any foreign government or the agents thereof for redress of any injury which he may have sustained from such government or any of its agents or subjects 1 stat 613 january 30 1799 codified at 18 u s c 953 2004
4690883 the clear intent of this provision is to prohibit unauthorized persons from intervening in disputes between the united states and foreign governments
4690884 nothing in section 953 however would appear to restrict members of the congress from engaging in discussions with foreign officials in pursuance of their legislative duties under the constitution
4690885 i made it clear that i had no authority to negotiate on behalf of the united states that i had come to listen and learn
4690886 without authority of the united states directly or indirectly commence or carry on any correspondence or intercourse with any foreign government or any officer or agent thereof with intent to influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer or agent thereof in relation to any disputes or controversies with the united states
4690887 by and with the advice and consent of the senate
4690888 obama was auditioning for the job of president this week and i think he showed he is up to it
4690889 just let me remind everybody that im not the president i am a us senator i am a candidate for president
4690890 but theres a wonderful tradition in the united states thats not always observed but i think is a good one which is that you dont spend time criticizing a sitting president when youre overseas
4690891 intent to influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer or agent thereof in relation to any disputes or controversies with the united states
4690892 the situation in afghanistan is perilous and urgent we must act now to reverse a deteriorating situation
4690893 i called over a year ago for additional u s troops to be placed in afghanistan as well as more nonmilitary assistance and more support from our nato allies and im glad that theres a growing consensus back home that we need more resources in afghanistan we should not wait any longer to provide them
4690894 in our meetings with president karzai and the other afghan leaders i stressed my strong commitment to afghanistan security and economic development and urged them to work on a more for more basis more u s and nato support for afghanistan and more action by the afghan government to take on corruption and counter narcotics to improve the rule of law and to make sure that resources and services are actually delivered for the afghan people
4690895 we also need a policy as both jack reed and chuck hagel mentioned that compels pakistani action against terrorists who threaten our common security and are using the fata and the northwest territories of pakistan as a safe haven and we have to do this at the same time as we deepen our relationship with the pakistani people and the recently elected democratic government
4690896 together i believe we have to succeed in taking the fight to the terrorists in order to protect the american people as well as the afghan people and to do that were going to have to support lasting stability for afghanistan and pakistan as well as economic opportunity for their people
4690897 we also noted that the political reconciliation and economic development thats necessary for long term stability in iraq continues to lag there is security progress now we need a political solution the message we heard from iraqs leaders is that theyre ready to do more and they want to take more responsibility for their country and i believe that the best way to support iraqi sovereignty and to encourage the iraqis to stand up is through the responsible redeployment of our combat brigades
4690898 i can speak about my judgment and say that if you look at where were moving toward internationally a need to refocus attention on afghanistan and to go after the taliban including putting more troops on the ground and to put more pressure on pakistan to deal with the safe havens of terrorists in their territory when you look at the need for engagement with iran something that i was scorned for during earlier parts of the campaign when you look at an increasing recognition that we cant stay in iraq in perpetuity and that a time frame timetable timeline whatever you want to refer to is appropriate i think that the judgments that ive made over the course of the last two years are ones that match up with the reality on the ground
4690899 intent to influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer or agent thereof in relation to any disputes or controversies with the united states
4690900 what ive said is that if we had actionable intelligence against high value al qaida targets and the pakistani government was unwilling to go after those targets that we should
4690901 he added that he would put pressure on islamabad to move aggressively against terrorist training camps in the countrys northwestern tribal areas
4690902 candidate obama gave these statements i come out openly and say such statements undermine support dont do it
4690903 it may also well prove beyond the powers even of the energetic and charismatic obama in iraq he is listening to what the iraqis want in pakistan he is simply dictating policy in a somewhat bellicose fashion and ignoring the wishes of those moderate parties whose election he lauded last february
4690904 without authority of the united states directly or indirectly commences or carries on any correspondence or intercourse with any foreign government or any officer or agent thereof with intent to influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer or agent thereof in relation to any disputes or controversies with the united states or to defeat the measures of the united states
4690905 defeat the measures of the united states in other words the intentions of us foreign policy at this time
4690906 the war against al qaeda and the taliban cannot stop at the borders of afghanistan but will also include pakistan
4690907 its very clear that more has to be done to stabilize that border between afghanistan and pakistan
4690908 i will push pakistan very hard to go after those training camps
4690909 maar ook gevaarlijk want wat als ze nu nee hadden gezegd
4690910 dan had je in je eentje moeten blijven staan en dat wil je juist niet meer
4690911 naarmate de eerste schooldag nadert neemt hun nervositeit toe en daarmee ook de motivatie om een goede start te maken
4690912 de overgang naar een vreemde groep is een uitgelezen moment ander gedrag te vertonen die kans moeten ze grijpen
4690913 de pikorde in een groep is binnen een paar weken soms al dagen bepaald ze moeten er zelf voor zorgen dat ze dit keer in het goede hokje terechtkomen
4690914 hoor ik er nu bij is de centrale levensvraag in die fase
4690915 maar dat is geen reden het probleem ongemoeid te laten
4690916 ouders hebben weinig kinderen die moeten alles kunnen sociaal sterk zijn goed op school sportief en muzikaal
4690917 samen ontbijten is er niet altijd meer bij maar dat zijn wel d momenten waarop een kind kan vertellen waarom hij niet naar school wil
4690918 de eerste de beste die mij nu nog pest grijp ik bij zijn keel en trek ik naar beneden
4690919 voor iedereen is het spannend een nieuwe school iedereen wil vrienden maken je moet dan niet wegduiken of raar doen want dan denken ze laat maar die wil niet

4690921 to be able to win in los angeles ive never ever felt as much pressure in coaching as i did trying to bring home the gold in los angeles
4690922 coaches do not get gold medals that hardly seemed fair
4690923 i was sweating i was worried about it i was like oh hes got to make it and i think everyones pulling for him i know all the usa teams gotta be pulling hard
4690924 it was incredible just being there you know its exciting watching it but having been there i think ive got a better feel you know just for the energy the intensity the competitiveness of the olympic games its incredible unlike any other sporting event you will see when you get that many people competing for gold medals
4690925 given the pattern of the thing its not unreasonable for people to ask
4690926 the media and a large chunk of the public including some of johns supporters still question whether hes told the whole truth
4690927 happy to take a paternity test and would love to see it happen
4690928 i feel sorry for his family because how horrible but also dont you think he is the father of the child
4690929 anybody whos been around campaigns knows that folks come and go
4690930 i would only have positive things to say about him as being a helpful friendly and pleasant co worker to a new employee
4690931 they seemed to be crazy about each other they certainly are crazy about their kids and dog

4690933 help two friends and former colleagues rebuild their lives when harassment by supermarket tabloids made it impossible for them to move forward on their own
4690934 try to see if i can get some bigwigs from back here to go up there and say look you just gotta make up your mind you gotta get this done
4690935 the events of sept 11 are a part of our lives and our national history and a part of our story
4690936 if they want to become part of the country after living through such a formative experience for the country then we think thats the right answer
4690937 the more liberal camp just assumes that pastor warren is going to make this a christian litmus test of the presidency others who are more conservative fear he is going to wimp out on some of the issues
4690938 he says neither group understands or knows me hes going to ask tough questions fair questions not gotcha questions
4690939 it is a great example of the power of natural selection
4690940 make us healthier by cleansing what we will eat of food borne pathogens and parasites
4690941 we should look at whether there is any possibility of revisiting the space shuttle extension even for short period of time while we are in the middle of this political and diplomatic and military nightmare

4690945 could threaten our ability to make the maximum possible use
4690946 we are hopeful we can continue cooperation with the russians
4690947 but a lot of this depends on russia and what russias actions are in the near future
4690948 were optimistic things will work out in the long run
4690949 their failure to do so has put us in this regrettable situation
4690950 barring a major rupture in the u s russian relationship across the board
4690951 i do not see why space cooperation cannot be maintained
4690952 its ironic fda would choose to ignore dozens of studies funded by the national institutes of health this countrys best scientists and instead rely on flawed studies from industry
4690953 inconsistencies and inadequacies which limit the interpretations of the findings

4690985 only the russians are at present developing ways to ship both oil and gas from arctic offshore platforms
4690986 but surely the major north american companies must now be looking at the possibility of using a similar system
4690987 if those companies do opt for this it will be important to know where the terminals will be if they are built on the u s alaskan side of the arctic canada can expect the sovereignty crisis of 1969 and 1970 to be renewed
4690988 there have been no changes in either the american or canadian position about the passage of tankers through the northwest passage
4690989 our ability to assert control in our northern waters is limited
4690990 more troubling is that the government has failed to develop a comprehensive policy framework to control the arctic effectively
4690991 the martin government had begun such an effort the northern strategy with a section that was to provide a much stronger policy framework to assert canadian control over our arctic waters its defeat derailed that effort
4690992 the harper government has promised to continue this work but has not publicly released any version of its strategy
4690993 time is running out if we do not have a clear policy framework for all shipping in the arctic it will be too late to do so after the new shipping arrives
4690994 the melting ice in the northwest passage is going to result in more international shipping in the arctic canada needs to be prepared for when it comes or else the world will simply ignore canada

4691097 well anyone could buy a green jaguar find beauty in a japanese screen two thousand years old i would rather be a connoisseur of neglected rivers and flowering mustard and the flush iridescent pink on an intersection pigeons charcoal neck

4691109 the biggest artists event amp producer battle on the eastside
4691110 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
4691111 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
4691112 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters now is who uses that language for what purpose
4691113 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
4691114 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
4691115 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
4691116 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
4691117 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
4691118 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
4691119 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
4691120 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
4691121 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
4691122 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
4691123 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
4691124 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
4691125 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
4691126 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
4691127 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
4691128 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
4691129 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
4691130 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
4691131 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
4691132 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
4691133 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
4691134 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
4691135 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
4691136 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
4691137 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
4691138 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
4691139 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
4691140 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
4691141 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
4691142 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
4691143 politics depends to a great extent on judging what is actual relative to what is possible however we have an inherently weak grasp of what is possible and most societies are not set up so as naturally to improve this or to make us aware of possibilities we may have ignored or taken with insufficient seriousness

4691146 i would not be surprised if some ethnic minorities in china were offended by this but they are also accustomed to it
4691147 in the west we are obsessed with authenticity in such matters but its different in china id guess many chinese would not have a problem with it
4691148 i see nothing wrong exactly with where the children are from it is a tradition in china in terms of giving a performance
4691149 i think the fear for many is does harmony and unity ultimately mean assimilation and surrendering their own identity and autonomy

4691162 we saw over the last many years disenchantment by democratic party activists who felt the past policies of the local party were out of step with san franciscos democratic values
4691163 were reaching out to people who were turned off but were not alienating people who have been party stalwarts for decades
4691164 democrats in san francisco care about health care education and public safety they dont care about these lunatic fringe issues
4691165 people in san francisco are smart and they know better than to follow chris dalys advice
4691166 theres a litmus test that some people try to apply that if you dont agree with us on every single issue youre not progressive
4691167 what ive learned at this conference is that we have a very ethnically diverse population and its very important not to have assumptions or judgements about people and really be very sensitive that different cultures express what they need and are looking for in a different way
4691168 in terms of our sexual assault and sexual molestation cases the statistics have been the same throughout the years it is very unfortunate again the majority of our victims are children the predators are family members or friends of the family people who are known to the victim those statistics have not changed
4691169 i think that our workers just need to be a little bit sensitive to understand just what the cultural beliefs are so that when we do our investigation we keep that in mind and do our intervention with them
4691170 our total case load right now is around 9 000 we used to have 12 000 but weve been trying to do a clean up in the office by getting rid of all the cases that qualify for case closure
4691171 we are following up on what we found and seeing where that takes us and what its all going to mean
4691172 some things may turn out to be very useful but at this time there is nothing new and the investigation is ongoing

4691179 i dont mean disrespect to any other director but even on thinking hard i dont thing anyone in last 15 20 years has been able to achieve such love and acceptance from the audience box office numbers are a clear indicator of audiences enthusiasm about the film i am very happy that my film has been liked and is already garnering repeat audiences bottom line is for a film to be loved and run well at theaters
4691180 manji was a great filmmaker he had no pretensions about the kind of cinema he wanted to make and his track record pretty much indicates that
4691181 even he didnt make films for critics he made them for the aam junta call it formulaic call it clich d call it unabashedly commercial the fact remains that one has to serve to the audience what entertains them most seriously when crores of people out there love your film should one really be concerned about making these 4 5 critics happy
4691182 this suggests a fall of 62 over weekdays 45 gross weekend gt 15cr per day 23 crores in 4 week

4691184 we are in possession of eight houses where we want to do a total immersion cultural center so each house would be a different medium one would be carving performing arts culinary and so forth
4691185 its important because theres a lot of artists that are struggling to have a place and a lot of children and youth that really want to learn the skills and trades and so this is why we need to be here

4691237 evil is real only because we make it real evil can live in a person and society as well i have been inflicted by an evil demon that is nurtured by our so called criminal justice system but know im still fighting
4691238 i think when you look at mitt romney hes not in the totally uncomfortable column but hes not in the completely comfortable column
4691239 those that do have opposition to him theyre pretty adamant in their opposition
4691240 not advance the ball within the evangelical bloc of voters that mccain needs
4691241 i think romney would be very acceptable to the foreign policy conservatives and the economic conservatives
4691242 but i think its fair to say that about 15 to 20 percent of evangelicals would have a difficult time voting for a mormon on either side of the ticket

4691249 i thought denver would be my last stop but things happened and here i am
4691250 the thing thats always impressed me the most is the way they play the game
4691251 he is a guy i have admired for a long time his playing style and his production he has been a great player with different organizations and with nine pro bowls
4691252 im kind of nervous the reason why being what we did last year as a whole unit
4691253 were going to try and come out and put points on the board because thats what the coaches ask us to do the expectations the bars set so high here not by you all and not by the fans but the coaches and the team we have high expectations for this offense and this team as a unit but what we did last year man i dont think we can really live and dwell off that
4691254 when i took that last stroke i thought i lost the race there but it turns out that was the difference im just lost for words
4691255 i had to take my goggles off first to make sure the one was next to my name when i saw the 50 58 and the 50 59 and i saw the one next to my name thats when i sort of let my roar out im happy we have a good race tomorrow that im looking forward to
4691256 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4691257 it was clear from the video it was a matter of stroking one was stroking phelps and the other was gliding
4691258 i saw a replay a few minutes after the race and i heard a few things about a protest but im not thinking about it
4691259 its great to win a medal i know i had a long finish and phelps had a short finish im not angry

4691288 when i saw the 50 58 and the 50 59 and i saw the 1 next to my name thats when i sort of let my roar out
4691289 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i had lost the race right there but i guess that was the difference in the end
4691290 i was starting to hurt for the last 10 metres it was my last individual race and i just wanted to finish as strong as i could
4691291 i think the biggest thing is when someone says you cant do something
4691292 it shows that anything is possible when you put your mind to it
4691293 if anyone would have said before the games that id win two golds and break the world record id have laughed in their face
4691294 sure it is about sport but we will also take the chance to showcase the creative capital that london is
4691295 we can bring a massive level of creativity and britishness in the very best sense of the word and fun lets have a bit of fun with this
4691296 there are lots of things i think we can do which are quite instinctive to us anyway what does the world know about us were actually quite good at partying lets turn it into a giant party
4691297 the very best around at arranging pop concerts and directing west end shows and theyre british
4691298 they looked at that and thought thats really good but we can do something as good set in a different context
4691299 they were more pumped up because it was so good i think they were quite excited by the challenge
4691300 this is amazing its fantastic its clearly been choreographed to within an inch of its life

4691357 they contacted defense industry officials and arms dealers and told them that georgia had relatively large budgets and could be interested in purchasing israeli weapons
4691358 his door was always open to the israelis who came and offered his country arms systems made in israel
4691359 compared to countries in eastern europe the deals in this country were conducted fast mainly due to the defense ministers personal involvement
4691360 it was clear that too many unmistakable israeli systems in the possesion of the georgian army would be like a red cloth in the face of a raging bull as far as russia is concerned
4691361 and that the interception of three of these rpvs in the past three months was an expression of this anger not everyone in israel understood the sensitive nerve israel touched when it supplied such an advanced arms system to a country whose relations with russia are highly tense
4691362 the entire front line of the armys brass stepped down because of the war gal hirsch who was defeated in lebanon went to georgia and they too lost because of him
4691363 relying on israeli experts and weapons georgia learned why the israeli generals failed

4691391 there s a lot of positive momentum with the psp
4691392 the biggest issue with umd was the lack of creating for a targeted demo
4691393 when we first launched it was a difficult sale i don t think it s a big stretch to say that a 16 year old doesn t have a lot of discretionary income we were offering umds that were more expensive than dvds at the time and we want content that is in line with what the demo is asking for action and comedy not romantic dramas
4691394 the studios are looking at this and saying what are the myriad of ways that content can reach all of the various consumer touch points
4691395 they want to grow that consumer base that they have
4691396 the future of psp is bright for video because of all the different methods consumers have to enjoy it

4691414 mr greenspan has been criticized for contributing to todays woes by keeping interest rates too low too long and by regulating too lightly he has been aggressively defending his record in interviews in op ed pieces and in a new chapter in his recent book included in the paperback version to be published next month mr greenspan attributes the rise in house prices to a historically unusual period in which world markets pushed interest rates down and even sophisticated investors misjudged the risks they were taking

4691420 when i was growing up i only wanted to do one thing and that was to play for my country i have come a long way since playing my first game which was at the mcg of all places i have had the honour of captaining my country and i just cant think of a life without cricket
4691421 a lot of people ask me for how long i will continue i say i dont know it all depends on my fitness and whether i am still good enough to play for sri lanka the day i feel i havent got it any more in me i will quit
4691422 there were a few things that i worked on after the australian series early this year it was the off season and there were no domestic competitions so i had a few sessions with the bowling machine and worked ever so harder on my physical fitness

4691425 its hard to understand they are such a strong batting side for me the best in the world without any doubt but sri lanka gave india no chance they kept the pressure on and its not easy when ajantha mendis and murali bowl in tandem i thought sri lanka had a good plan which they executed to perfection there was someone to rise to the occasion at every crucial point
4691426 but i am sure they indians will bounce back sachin is a class act rahul and sourav are quality players the point is when you are having such a long career like they have had you are bound to have a poor series it happens to all players in the world but the problem here was all three of them struggled at the same time
4691427 i am really happy for what ajantha has done hes come up the hard way and his rise to stardom is something of a fairy tale hes a quiet kind of chap who wants to keep improving i have a particular liking for blokes who are the first to practice and the last to leave and mendis is something similar when you play at this level you need to keep working harder and improve your game every day

4691430 in recent years the trend in ya fiction has been toward a proliferation of darker edgier fare aimed at a more mature audience
4691431 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected
4691432 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf

4691445 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4691558 plaintiffs will lose out on a fair amount of exposure and the opportunity to express their views in a popular forum

4691568 the nations expanding waistline threatens to have a devastating impact on our public services
4691569 the threat to our future health is just as significant as the current security threat
4691570 councils are increasingly having to consider taking action where parents are putting childrens health in real danger
4691571 it is vital that councils primary care trusts and the nhs work with parents to ensure children dont end up dangerously overweight in the first place there needs to be a national debate about the extent to which it is acceptable for local authorities to take action in cases where the childrens welfare is in jeopardy

4691574 i was starting to hurt a little bit with probably the last 10 meters
4691575 that was my last individual race so i was just trying to finish as strong as i could
4691576 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time hes the greatest racer who ever walked the planet
4691577 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4691578 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4691579 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4691580 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4691581 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4691582 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i lost the race there but i guess that was the difference in the race
4691583 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4691584 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4691585 i wasnt going to at first then i was saying to myself this race is going to be very tight and im going to use everything i got so i put it out there
4691586 i always welcome comments it definitely motivates me even more
4691587 im so proud of what hes been able to do
4691588 i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now
4691589 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4691590 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4691591 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4691592 every time you race phelps youll have a great race and a great time just hearing his arms slap on the block gets your heart racing hes amazing im so happy to get the medal
4691593 appreciate the moment the most precious treasure is my heart when i share it with you protect it as if it was your own
4691594 read this 10 step outline and get back to me when you are done
4691595 after all it is about change people want change but they are not content wiz change alone they want iksperience 113 votes are a clear sign of the thirst for change
4691596 it was hard growing up on bainbridge where there was nothing in school that talked about contributions of the minorities it was hard to have a sense of identity
4691597 all the pioneers were whites which was not the case
4691598 frank never mentioned anything about going through the japanese internment it was like it never existed
4691599 frank would go home after school to help in his family berry farming business many whites played basketball but frank did not as he was short
4691600 its the first time ive spent time with a japanese and you are just like anyone else
4691601 it was time i started caring about myself and finding out who i am
4691602 people got mad at us and refused to cooperate calling us angry young men
4691603 we pounded our way through and soon more and more people were willing to open up
4691604 if frank was not there to passionately push for this event it wouldnt have continued till now
4691605 children need to feel okay about who they are and realize they dont have to be white to be successful
4691606 do no harm and help people to become all they can become
4691607 i dont like that man i got to know him better
4691608 frank could have been a wealthier man if he had not been so dedicated to his passion
4691609 though i am really tight on paying bills i have decided that is not the most important thing i wished i had more life to continue what im doing now
4691610 he donates all of his time for free taking time away from his dental practice to work with school children and other interested groups on the japanese americans history
4691611 my brother has always been a leader a pioneer in every right
4691612 he said i was a cosmic turtle someone who dont see things to completion
4691613 im not a good organizer of information but ideas just pop into my head
4691614 frank is my role model and he constantly inspires me through his kindness dedication to the truth and deep understanding of the importance of working toward social justice and upholding our civil liberties
4691615 i look up to him as my mentor instead of the other way round when we see something that is not right we will talk about it but frank will act upon it

4691632 i hadnt realized how much my chemistry with him since titanic would still stick
4691633 its great to discover we can just slip right into it like muscle memory
4691634 what is this guy doing doesnt he see the impossible position hes putting us in is he trying to start a world war
4691635 mr president this is governor lutrin and i am calling on behalf of the nation of idaho and the new inland confederation
4691636 good evening governor lutrin i was hoping we could discuss a resolution to the latest unpleasantness
4691637 mr president i wanted to pass on to you my personal assurance on the territorial integrity of the remaining states in the former union known as these united states the departure of utah wyoming montana and eastern washington into the newly revived articles of confederation was a happenstance our exit did not anticipate we have no intention whatsoever of seeking additional members although i suspect your behavior has provided a tremendous incentive to cause more states to spin off from the orbit of dc i would like to recommend the creation of a summit to establish a peaceful reconciliation between the divorced parties to normalize trade and diplomatic relations
4691638 governor your actions have caused a cascading effect that has effectively opened national fissures that are difficult to contain
4691639 i would also like to offer my concerns on repatriating the surviving members of the 82d airborne division and elements of the xviii airborne corps both battalions of the 19 th special forces group airborne are remaining in the confederation of their own accord to husband the creation of our own national militia the critically wounded soldiers will receive the best care we can offer through their recovery and eventual return to your country we have already dispatched the surviving 35 paratroopers to the border for return i am hopeful we can sustain the agreed terms of the ceasefire and avoid any bloodshed in the future
4691640 that was the most lopsided defeat of american arms on our soil since
4691641 sir we initiated no aggression against these united states and simply did what we tend to do best when our backs are against the wall we are a rural nation with urban pockets and the character of these states tend to be rather impatient with being pushed around and bullied consider us as a porcupine that can do you no harm unless you visit violence on it you can say that the fury your armed forces experienced was a century of pent up frustration and aggression their sacrifice and bravery is acknowledged
4691642 the us is the most sophisticated and powerful military power on the face of the planet if i simply picked up the phone and called for air strikes or military reprisals we could bring you to your knees
4691643 that would be inadvisable to visit that kind of bloodshed on peaceful people that particular scenario is not working very well for you in the middle east i would also hope severe condemnations from civilized nations around the world would grace your desk i can promise you that we will initiate a number of retaliatory measures which require no military action on our behalf that will cause a modicum of grief to your administration
4691644 inspired by a terrific novel called molon labe we happen to have a complete database of all current physical addresses of all fleas federal law enforcement agent in the us available for broadcast release on the internet when we choose
4691645 i have filed a formal complaint with the united nations security council to issue an injunction against your secession
4691646 we cannot tell you who to associate with but we are not nor will we be members of the united nations we already have formal recognition from 55 nations including alaska switzerland russia and france where we are establishing formal consular offices we have formalized the transfer of all nuclear weapons and military facilities on confederation soil and will reimburse the us government for their costs after the auditors have finished calculating the total confederation tax bill bled to the rulers on the potomac since 1913 unfortunately i suspect the books may not balance in your favor so receipt of the funds in actual remuneration may not materialize
4691647 governor that is clear and simple theft of us government property to include the multibillion dollar facilities
4691648 mr president taxation is theft and the weight of federal encroachment on the states has been enormous once dc started to behave like an occupation government all the natural forces seeking remedy and escape started to form the perfect storm of events that liberated the confederation from the former us configuration we will conduct a full accounting of the valuation and match it to the previously mentioned audit we have no federal reserve and the confederation will be relying on free banking to mint a new currency or currencies backed by hard metal what little government we have will be financed through a one percent tariff at the borders
4691649 governor how can a government run on a one percent tax
4691650 mr president that is the original percentage of the income tax in 1913 we have already cashiered 98 of government workers in most of the states in the last two weeks this includes the former federal employees who chose to remain here each employee received the equivalent of five years salary in gold drawn from the caged irs account in boise they are among the last people we hope will ever get government aid in the state we have a unique agenda we intend to shrink government over time and if the future allows us to zero it completely so be it
4691651 that is impossible how will people survive without government support and protection
4691652 it just keeps spreading from one asset to another so its hard to know when these writedowns will stop
4691653 the u s economy needs to stabilize first but even then europe could lag and recover later theres still a lot more downside
4691654 i know a former leader working on forming a new party based on the same ideals
4691655 he is a leader i am happy to follow come what may and i have asked him to discuss various options with the leaders of the nfp
4691656 the betrayal or treason committed supported and encouraged by local lawyers
4691657 long gone are the days when lawyers as professionals saw it their duty as individuals and as a collective to do their utmost without fear of favor to uphold the constitutional integrity of the government
4691658 the blame or fault can not be laid on the council of the fiji law society
4691659 they didnt even thank me for buying some of their groceries
4691660 but having done that many of them must be wondering if their robin hood is really ravana who destroyed the golden lanka because of his selfish motives lust and greed
4691661 how can a man who has championed rule of law democracy human rights and the plight of the poor join a group of military officers who overthrow a democratically elected government
4691662 and more surprising an overthrow of a government in which his own party has participated
4691663 t he bank pretends it is lending for noble purposes while the borrowers pretend they will put the money to good use
4691664 i knew when i touched i had won and that was a great thing because i was just going for gold
4691665 i didnt expect that record at all it has always been a goal of mine but i never really expected it at this moment in time to do it now and to do that time it hasnt sunk in yet
4691666 this is just everything i have ever dreamed of and im so glad the hard work has paid off
4691667 beforehand bob bowman phelps coach said it would be good for me if i lost
4691668 when he said that i was fired up i said im going to go for it and when i saw that finish i said wow i had no idea the race was that close
4691669 when i took that last stroke i thought i had lost the race there but it turns out that was the difference im just lost for words
4691670 the plan was to go in and put everything on the line and see what i have to go home with im excited to hear the national anthem play and for everyone back home to hear it
4691671 this is very welcome news and many schools who have still not received complete results will undoubtedly feel some sense of vindication
4691672 the testing and examination system is sinking under its own weight and it is time for the government to examine seriously how it can streamline the assessment regime and again make it fit for purpose
4691673 i hope that instead of finding another company to mark future key stage three test papers for 14 year olds the government will scrap these expensive and unnecessary tests altogether
4691674 ets demonstrated pure incompetence when it came to marking this years tests many children are still waiting for their results which are now nearly six weeks late ministers must confirm that ets will not receive a single penny for the fiasco
4691675 ets europe was selected due to the strength of their worldwide experience in delivering large scale assessments
4691676 ets europe has apologised to schools for the delays in marking national curriculum assessments in england
4691677 to be added to the summer olympics a sport or discipline must be widely practised by men in at least 75 countries on four continents and by women in at least 40 countries on three continents
4691678 eliminate long work hours store managers in name only deserve dignity
4691679 look at what im driving do you think a guy who drives this has any extra money to give away
4691680 but when we come down here we rarely see people we know yall need to come out
4691681 i have a velvet elvis but because of the rain we couldnt bring out all of our good stuff
4691682 i made a pact with myself on the day i got hurt that i wasnt going to get into what if
4691683 on the other hand other people have had their wheels catch in the same way its not right to have a condition like that and not fix it
4691684 could not sort through their records to produce accident reports for the montlake bridge
4691685 so if you want to find out if an intersection is dangerous somehow or other you have to know who crashed and what day it was
4691686 but how is somebody supposed to know who was involved in all of these various accidents all these years
4691687 we take it seriously and well take a look at everything listed in their complaint
4691688 im realistic that it might take a long time when i look at the course of my progress its slow and sometimes it comes in spurts
4691689 there are things that are really small that i regard as major accomplishments like being able to salt my own food
4691690 having four of our banks of transformers back online gives us some level of confidence for meeting customer needs during the remainder of the weekend
4691691 we can close our doors and ask guests to leave but the fish still need life support
4691692 we would send people home and customers might go to a competitor
4691693 i felt a lot more confident with my putter wie said

4691696 if i play good everything will take care of itself
4691697 they always have such a great golf course and always the condition of the golf course i realize this week is not easy because the rough is so long probably the longest rough of the year i think

4691699 its important to be in good position for the weekend
4691700 on the back nine my caddie mike powell and i were reciting bible verses and i just lost track of what score i was at hull said
4691701 there might be something about playing in canada hull said

4691735 commerce worked with the issuers of auction rate securities and governmental entities to explore broader solutions to the liquidity situation
4691736 with no broad solution forthcoming commerce will offer relief by buying back all of its customers auction rate securities bought from commerce at par value

4691739 weve always had a pretty good rapport between a b and all the trades here the machinists the brewers the electricians and the pipe fitters it was a good give and take situation the company and labor were always able to sit down and work it out
4691740 agreement before contract expiration to receive pay increases early and to provide employees the certainty of a new labor agreement for the next several years
4691741 i hit myself in the head and said this a no brainer
4691742 so dealerships being entrepreneurially driven will become more creative in finding sources for revenue
4691743 itll never compare in revenue but this will be more profitable because this has so many fewer employees
4691744 with insurance the question is when i have a problem are they going to make things easy for me
4691745 if they feel comfortable enough to spend 25 000 for a car with us there is some level of trust
4691746 i think were on the cusp of a new era
4691747 so many companies are expanding horizontally instead of vertically to broaden resources for income
4691748 finally we are going to have a brand that has what it takes today to be a global brand as opposed to brands that still need to be developed in terms of awareness and penetration in consumers minds
4691749 it sounds great on paper but i think it will be a challenge
4691750 just dont expect it too soon and dont expect it to be easy
4691751 its important to try because if you can establish a global brand its incredible
4691752 there is no such thing as a good influence mr gray all influence is immoral immoral from the scientific point of view
4691753 because to influence a person is to give him ones own soul he does not think his natural thoughts or burn with his natural passions his virtues are not real to him his sins if there are such things as sins are borrowed he becomes an echo of some one elses music an actor of a part that has not been written for him the aim of life is self development to realize ones nature perfectly that is what each of us is here for people are afraid of themselves nowadays they have forgotten the highest of all duties the duty that one owes to ones self of course they are charitable they feed the hungry and clothe the beggar but their own souls starve and are naked courage has gone out of our race perhaps we never really had it the terror of society which is the basis of morals the terror of god which is the secret of religion these are the two things that govern us and yet i believe that if one man were to live out his life fully and completely were to give form to every feeling expression to every thought reality to every dream i believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we would forget all the maladies of mediaevalism and return to the hellenic ideal to something finer richer than the hellenic ideal it may be
4691754 aspi is an independent non partisan policy institute it has been set up by the government to provide fresh ideas on australias defence and strategic policy choices
4691755 north pole may be ice free for first time this summer
4691756 not all the large changes seen in arctic climate in recent years are a result of long term trends associated with global warming
4691757 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
4691758 and even more if more should be required the future of human civilization is at stake
4691759 in july 2006 wind turbines in california produced power at only about 10 of their capacity in texas one of the most promising states for wind energy the windmills produced electricity at about 17 of their rated capacity
4691760 is contingent on an imperviousness to the realities of life all active mass movements strive therefore to interpose a fact proof screen between the faithful and the realities of the world they do this by claiming that the ultimate and absolute truth is already embodied in their doctrine and that there is no truth nor certitude outside it to rely on the evidence of the senses and of reason is heresy and treason it is startling to realize how much unbelief is necessary to make belief possible
4691761 the u s government has spent some 7 billion building a repository for nuclear waste at yucca mountain in nevada
4691762 coal is making us sick oil is making us sick
4691763 on june 3 the department of energy submitted an 8 600 page application to the nuclear regulatory commission seeking approval of the yucca mountain site for waste storage just one day later nevada urged the agency to reject the application
4691764 no u s plant worker or member of the public has ever been injured or killed by an accident caused by nuclear power
4691765 im really not a chicken little player but i worry that no one seems to be focusing in on this
4691766 the level of excess capacity has shrunk to a level barely within the planning toleration of the industry
4691767 were to the point where we need every possible resource renewables demand response and energy efficiency nuclear clean coal you name it we need it and we especially need the transmission lines that will bring the power generated by these new resources to consumers
4691768 climate is changing on mars but there are no suvs there
4691769 thermometer records showing heating are contaminated by the urban heat island effect
4691770 all three factions are wrong but the first is the worst
4691771 the armageddon scenario that he depicts is not based on any scientific view
4691772 the improver of natural knowledge absolutely refuses to acknowledge authority as such for him scepticism is the highest of duties blind faith the one unpardonable sin
4691773 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention the real enemy then is humanity itself
4691774 the desire to save humanity is always a false front for the urge to rule it
4691775 this crippling of individuals i consider the worst evil of capitalism i am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils namely through the establishment of a socialist economy accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals in such an economy the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion a planned economy which adjusts production to the needs of the community would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man woman and child
4691776 the object in life is not to be on the side of the majority but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane
4691777 the modern literature on hate crimes began with a remarkable 1933 book by arthur raper titled the tragedy of lynching raper assembled data on the number of lynchings each year in the south and on the price of an acres yield of cotton he calculated the correla tion coefficient between the two series at 0 532 in other words when the economy was doing well the number of lynchings was lower in 2001 donald green laurence mcfalls and jennifer smith published a paper that demolished the alleged connection between economic condi tions and lynchings in rapers data raper had the misfortune of stopping his anal ysis in 1929 after the great depression hit the price of cotton plummeted and economic condi tions deteriorated yet lynchings continued to fall the correlation disappeared altogether when more years of data were added
4691778 our best hope for lifesaving cures and medicines is biotechnology
4691779 we should be encouraging our nations small businesses to develop these breakthroughs and to take these breakthroughs from the lab to patients not throwing up roadblocks
4691780 it sounds ridiculous but im scraping by by the skin of my teeth to make it to the next milestone
4691781 theres no room for mistakes and if you have a second idea you have to put it on the shelf
4691782 having that extra federal grant money would allow us to pursue some very exciting parallel paths
4691783 it would allow venture capital firms to participate in a program that was not intended for them
4691784 neither of us really like it and everyone is still trying to figure out who won
4691785 i am told that is the sign of a good compromise
4691786 venture capitalists have told us that they dont invest in early stage research because it is too high risk
4691787 research from high tech firms and start up firms in rural states like missouri where there is very little venture capital activity could also suffer
4691788 excludes too many small businesses from competing for funds to develop life saving cures and medicines
4691789 everyone will be a winner when one of these companies finds a breakthrough to curing cancer parkinsons or other life threatening and debilitating diseases
4691790 during that time a company cant go to a bank for a normal small business loan these are not normal small businesses because theres no revenue coming in
4691791 so small businesses have to turn to investors selling parts of the company to raise the funds they need thats why venture capital is so important
4691792 the premise that you cannot be a small company if youre receiving venture capital is just ridiculous
4691793 we fund a huge number of small companies all across the united states and simply because a company receives venture capital doesnt mean theyre rolling in the dough
4691794 the science is not good the management team is not good or a combination of that
4691795 are like saying were only going to support people who havent won the gold medal in the olympics
4691796 it helps you keep a clear head in this volatile market
4691797 is there some other way to cut back before they cut back their 401 k
4691798 its a way to get people in the habit of contributing without really missing the deduction from their paycheck
4691799 a rice flour bread that you steam and its omygosh so delicious

4691804 those guys are the best in the world and watching what they do to prepare for a big tournament watching how they warm up every day and play their practice rounds hopefully that experience should make it easier next week to not get overwhelmed about how big the u s amateur is
4691805 being at the u s open it doesnt get any bigger than that
4691806 these two cases in texas are just the tip of the iceberg
4691807 across texas and around the country people are convicted of arson based on junk science that has been completely discredited for years
4691808 is that it was pretty much the wild west back then that the state of the science was dismal
4691809 each and every one of the indicators listed by mr vasquez means absolutely nothing and in fact is expected in a context of a fire that has achieved full room involvement as this fire clearly did
4691810 low burning charred flooring burning underneath items of furniture are common characteristics of a fully involved fire
4691811 they mean nothing with respect to the origin and cause of the fire
4691812 i talked to the occupant of this house and i let him talk and he told me a story of pure fabrication
4691813 tells the story i am just the interpreter i am looking at the fire and i am interpreting the fire that is what i know that is what i do best and the fire does not lie it tells me the truth
4691814 i am an innocent man convicted of a crime i did not commit i have been persecuted for 12 years for something i did not do
4691815 theres nothing to suggest to any reasonable arson investigator that this was an arson fire it was just a fire
4691816 we saw a lot of road kill and thought of you
4691817 we saw a lot of road kill and thought of you
4691818 son ciclos estoy cerrando mi carrera pero con mis 35 a os me voy feliz si no hubiese tenido mi final ol mpica por atenas 2004 hoy me iba triste
4691819 estoy muy contento estaba un poco nervioso antes de la carrera pero fue mi mejor prueba
4691820 is really going to hurt the olympics parks were full at all times
4691821 representatives from all tiers of government have voiced concerns over the access closure
4691822 federal treasurer and member for lilley wayne swan state member for nudgee neil roberts and brisbane city councillor kim flesser have all expressed their apprehension over the commercial decision of the company to inconvenience cannery workers with the closure
4691823 yes workers did raise safety concerns concerns that the workers wanted fixed they did not want the railway station access closed golden circle have a responsibility to facilitate a safe access point
4691824 the fact that they waited 60 years to do something is a clear indicator how on the ball golden circle management is
4691825 golden circles cut and run attitude in this matter has caused a lot of anger they have been irresponsible and thoughtless in not attempting to set this problem right
4691826 it doesnt take a rocket scientist to suggest fixing any existing safety risks rather than simply closing the access would have been the way to go golden circle has a duty of care to provide a safe access for their employees to enter the work site
4691827 but in this matter golden circle have put money before people
4691828 the doch gypsy orchestra is easily our favourite gig as a band
4691829 there is just nothing that compares to having so many people on stage and so many people going crazy in the audience having bane as well as silvia and goran in the mix for this year is going to make 2008 something really special
4691830 doch gypsy orchestra will be selling copies of their cds bride in a red dress this drink this moon and chasing grasshoppers as well as the live dvd the man who drinks throughout the season
4691831 the perfect soundtrack for merriment of every description theres nothing you cant do to this music
4691832 we are building the future of dubai sorry for the inconvenience
4691833 so now the process can be fully diagrammed and the cast of characters is stunning
4691834 we also recognize that such health care and education help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions the democratic party also strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and post natal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
4691835 because we believe in the privacy and equality of women we stand proudly for a womans right to choose consistent with roe v wade and regardless of her ability to pay we stand firmly against republican efforts to undermine that right at the same time we strongly support family planning and adoption incentives abortion should be safe legal and rare
4691836 defeat one who poses an even greater threat to human life and dignity
4691837 end the political manipulation of catholic voters by abortion advocates
4691838 we will never succeed in building a culture of life if we continue to vote for politicians who defend and support a culture of death
4691839 imagine if this year millions of catholic voters simply said no no to every candidate of every political party who supports abortion
4691840 its time we stop accommodating pro abortion politicians and its time we start demanding that they accommodate us
4691841 if you converse regularly bantering back and forth throughout the course of your workday its okay to leave out a salutation
4691842 otherwise people can feel as though you didnt care enough to write out their name to really get someones attention the best thing you can do is call them by name
4691843 at the end of the day its all about your image
4691844 typos and poor grammar are the equivalent of walking into a room looking unshowered and disheveled good writing in an email shows you have both professionalism and class
4691845 linstabilit e la debolezza delle istituzioni mauritane possono favorire i terroristi
4691846 i wouldve been quite happy to get on the plane with them but we had some unfinished business here obviously my life has been invested in this but other peoples lives as well we think its the right thing to do to try to finish what we started
4691847 to have hugh there is what were comfortable with what were used to seeing throughout the match
4691848 our staff did a great job without him but this is how weve built our team with him on the sideline
4691849 i told her dont start a fight unless you can finish it
4691850 there was no way she could beat the first two girls but i knew she could close
4691851 my coach said before the race to fall asleep for a couple laps and then give it a go
4691852 i was just running so within myself trying to stay calm
4691853 i couldnt celebrate because i thought i might have been fourth
4691854 in my era it all started with deena kastor winning bronze in athens 2004 in the marathon
4691855 that made us really dream big i think kara reinforced it
4691856 it gets your mind off the race and allows you to get healthy again
4691857 i wouldnt change anything good for her eating the poisonous food i guess
4691858 i hate the word fluke and it has been said a lot about me
4691859 i think shalane proved it was not a fluke that u s distance running is at the world level
4691860 on a hard day i guess ill take a silver
4691861 ive already expressed that to them i mean thats not an option
4691862 last season even though we had a poor season i was one of the players that suffered the most on the team because at the trade deadline we brought in even more guards and i saw my minutes drop and there really was no merit for that i really dont understand why my minutes dropped this year the problem is still the same i dont see it getting better maybe somewhere else is better for my career
4691863 yeah i guess thats safe to say unless something changes with the negotiations but i really dont see that happening right now
4691864 america is great because america is good when america ceases to be good she will cease to be great
4691865 the church of england defeated catholicism and now we are doomed
4691866 sin dwells here and spiritual warfare will continue until the end
4691867 it occurred to me how touching such a view must have been for these very elderly religious women
4691868 because there was a time when they were the only two nuns left in their dying order
4691869 it had been the end of one era but the beginning of another
4691870 the faith might be dying out in one place but there is always a renewal and rebirth in others
4691871 look what i did for them and they put me on the cross
4691872 it is in the heart of jesus that the human heart discovers its true and unique meaning and destiny
4691873 always keep our eye on the sacred heart of jesus for from him you will learn the great lesson of love so necessary for every christian family
4691874 i will bless every house in which an image of my heart shall be exposed and honored
4691875 to conquer the whole world for the heart of jesus home after home family after family

4691879 intended to place msg on notice of class wide allegations of race discrimination
4691880 the fact is about one in five u s adults has a criminal record and a disproportionate number of them are african americans and hispanics millions of people like ms clarke are motivated to return to the workforce after they pay their debt to society only to be turned away by employers with unfair hiring policies
4691881 this type of discrimination is a worsening problem for workers who have had a brush with the law and has a devastating effect on low income communities nationwide and particularly on minority communities
4691882 the u s department of justice estimates that 32 2 1 in 3 of african american males 17 2 1 in 6 of hispanic males and 5 9 1 in 17 of white males are expected to go to prison during their lifetime if current incarceration rates remain unchanged bureau of justice statistics
4691883 facilitat ing the ascertainment of truth and the just resolution of legal claims
4691884 beforehand bob his coach said it would be good for me if i lost when he said that i was fired up i said im going to go for it and when i saw that finish i said wow
4691885 his name is abdul rashid code named abu abdullah he has surrendered with his pika gun and ammunition we wish that as he has returned home other militants should also follow suit and get benefited by governments surrender policy
4691886 i appeal to other colleagues that if they want to lead peaceful lives they should come and surrender like me i have surrendered to the security forces and am sitting here fearlessly with them and having food
4691887 by hosting these poland is making itself a target this is 100 per cent certain it becomes a target for attack such targets are destroyed as a first priority
4691888 the deployment of new missile defence facilities in europe is aimed against the russian federation
4691889 the cold war is over bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4691890 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4691891 i will probably be the only us president who can cook qeema and dal
4691892 we have our candidate anwar whether we will complete this process of transformation will be determined by permatang pauh voters they not only decide for themselves but for 27 million malaysians
4691893 do you remember what you were doing when the four won gold in greece
4691894 do you remember what you were doing when the four won in athens
4691895 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold
4691896 we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film released july 11 2007 which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment
4691897 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films
4691898 post production on half blood prince was completed on time and the studios release plans for the will not be affected by this change
4691899 i am extremely proud of this latest film and of the work of director david yates and our incomparable cast
4691900 i believe we have developed and pushed the series further still we are all looking forward to sharing it with harry potter fans around the world even if we have to wait just a bit longer
4691901 even as we put finishing touches on this latest film
4691902 we are already beginning preparations on the final two films and i am excited to bring this remarkable series to the exciting and moving conclusion its loyal fans deserve
4691903 when warner bros decided to move harry potter and the half blood prince to the summer of 2009 we saw a unique opportunity to slot in our film which has been gaining tremendous awareness and momentum over the past several months
4691904 we by no means are trying to fill the shoes of the incredible potter franchise for 2008 rather we are just looking to bring the fans of stephenie meyers incredible book series the film as soon possible from a programming perspective
4691905 48a on the 12v or 25a on 12v1 and 25a on 12v2
4691906 i got thrown out of school several weeks in my senior year being caught in the girls dorm
4691907 he didnt look good to me and i knew this could be it
4691908 i said hey bernard how are you and i kissed his forehead
4691909 he shrugged his shoulders like im tired and i said i know youre tired later on that night it took a turn for the worse
4691910 the doctor came in and i said hes gone isnt he
4691911 he said you never seen a black man as pretty as me
4691912 i said what do you have for me and he kissed me that was our first kiss
4691913 je commen ais tre cuit dans les dix derniers m tres c tait ma derni re course individuelle et je voulais terminer aussi fort que possible a t il ajout jai pens que javais perdu la course mi parcours mais jai r ussi faire la diff rence tout la fin
4691914 has it come to this has the magical impact of george lucas original vision of star wars been reduced to the level of saturday morning animation
4691915 its a deadening film that cuts corners on its animation and slumbers through a plot that a makes us feel like weve seen it all before and b makes us wish we hadnt
4691916 we saw this in a theater full of kids and there wasnt a single moment that caused spontaneous cheering
4691917 ziro the hutt is perhaps the most bizarre character ever created in the series history yes including jar jar a jabba shaped slug who wears face paint and feathers the creature speaks english rather than huttese except that he she somehow has the accent of truman capote by way of eric cartman of south park
4691918 i found it impossible to concentrate on much of anything she he was saying except to imagine that all of this would one day make for a great book entitled in cold hutt naturally
4691919 the character was so bad so incredibly awful that it was a slap to the face it is many times worse than im actually describing this character was actually too much for me
4691920 after meeting ahsoka we really understand why he killed all the younglings id have done it with my bare hands she calls him skyguy which is amazingly annoying and he calls her snips
4691921 of course the anakin ahsoka relationship is made impossibly awkward by the fact that shes half naked and 12 and that theyre always in close quarters i dont need the force to see this fan fiction coming
4691922 cuando se quieren de verdad no existe tanta falsedad y menos tanta hypocrecia estoy perdiendo la razon tu me has robado el corazon siempre creii que me querias estoy perdiendo la razon me esta doliendo el corazon han sido muchas tus mentiras
4691923 te la he subido para que no tengas que bajar todo el disco
4691924 zuabi and his cast not only embrace and cherish the authors passions they honour his passing with dignity and grace
4691925 a vivid piece of lateral thinking which takes darwishs words off the page and puts flesh and blood on a statesmanlike meditation
4691926 are you the heart doctor whos been treating my grandmother

4691928 so the low down of this is buy a gift card for yourself or for someone else and help keep me from becoming homeless and unable to make you new pretty things in a month all store cards are marked down in price in the dispensers around my main store location l 450 for a l 500 value store card l 900 for a l 1000 value store card l 2000 for a l 2500 value store card l 4000 for a l 5000 value store card
4691929 im against the lottery but if one of my members won i wish and hope he would give 10 percent to the church

4691943 democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely antiwar ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul
4691944 members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel have gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama

4691989 i know im the fastest in the first 50 i know michael is a back half swimmer the last 15 meters i knew he was there i saw a shadow from the side of my goggles i knew he was coming

4691992 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay tomorrow its going to be a race

4691996 theres a time and place for everything and now is the time
4691997 i felt like there was no bigger event in hip hop at this moment than me and t i working together
4691998 it was always turmoil between our camp and his camp us as the bosses of our companies everyone is gonna follow our lead wed figure if it aint no problem and we dont have no issues no beef then theres no reason we shouldnt be able to get together and make music that was an executive decision that was made on both our behalves
4691999 i was surprised just as much as everybody else was
4692000 i talked to luda and he said it was time to sit down do business make grown man moves both of them got albums coming out time to try new things cris did something for t i too that nobody heard yet its about to come out soon its a good move
4692001 its showing that once great minds set their differences aside they can make something happen
4692002 thats two grown men not two grown males grown men
4692003 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4692004 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that senator mccain has used this song in a hit piece on barack obama is anathema to jackson
4692005 just change them to match what get info says for the good user

4692007 these are baseball decisions the shakeups got to come from the guys that are expected to perform melky cabrera batting ninth in our lineup is not supposed to be a difference maker in this club either way he was supposed to be able to slide right in while everybody else did their job
4692008 what we need is obviously the guys were counting on the guys that are making a significant amount of money that have significant performance levels to get the job done as expected and ill throw myself involved in that too i want to make sure im not pointing fingers were all in this thing together
4692009 its definitely good to get the opportunity to go out there and be that guy
4692010 we just felt that it was time for him to go work on some things you cant forget how young melky is
4692011 we believe that hes a much better player than a 240 hitter
4692012 the effort was there but for whatever reason it wasnt translating sometimes it can be difficult for young players to get out of a rut at this level
4692013 i cant tell you the exact date that hes going to be back but im confident that melkys a big league player and that hell get his stuff right
4692014 i have to go to triple a and work hard
4692015 i want to pitch for a long time i dont want to pitch for a year so i understand ive got to be patient

4692017 the admission that obamas mentor was frank marshall davis an identified cpusa member can only add to growing public concern about obamas relationship with a communist pawn of moscow who was the subject of security investigations by the fbi and various congressional committees which examined soviet activities in the u s
4692018 it is clear that corsi is to obama what the national enquirer is to admitted adulterer and liar john edwards the enquirer exposed edwards secret life when the rest of the media were refusing to investigate the candidate and making fun of the enquirer
4692019 you talk about what you like rather than what youre like
4692020 i was a little nervous before the race but i think that was my best race ever my dream was to be an olympic champion and that is now realized
4692021 its hard to come this far and know i have a faster race in me
4692022 it was a pretty good race result its my best time its fun its a lot of fun being in a big race like that
4692023 my start is not where it needs to be against a field like this
4692024 in a race like the 50 it doesnt always work out that way
4692025 ive discovered boys dont have time to talk to you dad
4692026 the thing thats keeping mike here right now is that dog
4692027 i was so busy and didnt get to do this or that

4692033 and it raised the specter of more bloodshed as the pilgrimage route becomes crowded before the event saturday
4692034 despite the security precautions kerbala is bracing for the worst local health director alaa hammoudi said that 40 medical units were standing by and that extra hospital beds were made ready near the mosque makeshift clinics were set up in tents and trailers some pilgrims donated blood
4692035 i saw smoke and i smelled the very bad smell of burned flesh and blood the reactions were a little less than at the last blast maybe because they already have been shocked
4692036 women here still feel threatened one cant yet see a pervasive shift in the way women dress they continue to wear the conservative clothing that the militias began compelling them to wear after the u s invasion most women remain cocooned in shapeless black abaya dresses and hijab scarves that covered their hair before the war tammy says she could walk down the streets of her hometown the southern and heavily shia iraqi port city of basra dressed like most teenagers in the united states in jeans and no head scarf saddam husseins regime was one of the worlds most despotic but it was secular and allowed iraqi women personal rights and freedoms unparalleled in the persian gulf women who make up more than half of the countrys populartion could drive travel abroad alone serve in iraqi security forces and work side by side with men they chose whom to marry and whether to marry at all and were among the most educated in the region after the u s invasion in 2003 conservative muslim clerics called for iraq to become an islamic state in the name of islamic values they eroded the liberties women here enjoyed even under saddams oppressive regime schools once coed became segregated by gender women were afraid to go outside without a head scarf as sectarian violence engulfed baghdad and other parts of the country in 2006 it brought in its wake even more constraints on womens freedoms
4692037 the attention always focuses on the women where they were when assaulted their relations with the assailant the effects on their mental health and careers whether they are being adequately helped and so on that discussion as valuable as it is misses a fundamental point to understand military sexual assault let alone know how to stop it we must focus on the perpetrators we need to ask why do soldiers rape
4692038 we are an organization trying to end the illegal war we are not endorsing any candidate we are endorsing the end of the iraq war if you are with us on that we could use some donations to continue this struggle
4692039 the obama finance committee is under more pressure literally to pay hillary clintons debt to mark penn than to fund any messages on war recession and global warming
4692040 sheikh kahmees al dulaimi the imam of one of the mosques in falluja
4692041 a multi national force west marine was killed aug 14 when his unit received small arms fire during security operations approximately 1 km east of fallujah
4692042 a multi national corps iraq soldier died of non battle related causes aug 15 in baghdad an investigation into the cause of death is under way
4692043 look in the mirror go after the thieves because they might do it again and there was a lot of shenanigans in ohio the swing state that left kerry behind
4692044 i think it is more urban im working with producers who are just amazing
4692045 id rather not but id love them unconditionally if they wanted to
4692046 id just as soon they have a more normal childhood
4692047 id love to if i can find the right movie
4692048 were just trying to work it out with my schedule with the children
4692049 that was special but it was also strange because shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby
4692050 it was mind boggling i was shocked a little bit but it was really cool and she was happy
4692051 britney and kevin wanted to settle but there were issues of how much time we wanted and there was an upcoming court hearing scheduled
4692052 any time you can get a win against a caliber club like the white sox are its definitely huge
4692053 i knew at the worst it was going to be a sacrifice fly our team battled to the end
4692054 we really havent had a ton of excitement the last few weeks to that magnitude so it was big
4692055 we obviously played a long game yesterday and knowing weve got a day game tomorrow we didnt need to play those extra innings
4692056 carrasco actually threw me all sliders up until a fastball that was up and in that was the only fastball i saw the whole count except for that last pitch
4692057 we couldnt get anything going after the first inning their pitching held us down everybody in this clubhouse knows this was a tough loss we dont have to dwell on it
4692058 cara voc viu o que o phelps fez ele foi l e ganhou por um cent simo voc vai ganhar por um cent simo ou vai perder por um cent simo ent o vai l e bate na parede
4692059 i would hope that it stays within the competition but when you feel something cheap is going their way you give a little bit back to them
4692060 thats how soccer has always been you dont go out to play dirty but if you feel they are playing dirty then you give them a little something to think about
4692061 i feel like he always gets away with a few things little dives little elbows a little stepping on feet
4692062 if he starts doing that thats the type of game it is going to turn into we hope its a soccer game
4692063 i havent even thought about the previous game both teams respect each other a lot the crowds get into it and that brings out the intensity a little bit it makes it fun
4692064 it was a game in which the desire the competitiveness the energy were fantastic
4692065 the competitiveness is what gets you through games like that it was by far one of our best efforts of the year
4692066 we are making mistakes and that is still an issue for me
4692067 whether it is a lack of concentration or an inability to come up with a play it has to be better
4692068 we know what we have to do to win and im not concerned about any of the shenanigans that go along with it
4692069 what is clear from the internal documents is that clintons loss derived not from specific decisions she made but rather from the preponderance of the many she did not make
4692070 her hesitancy and habit of avoiding hard choices exacted a price that eventually sank her chances at the presidency
4692071 clintons top advisers never agreed on the answer over the course of the campaign they split into competing factions that drifted in and out of clintons favor but always seemed to work at cross purposes and clinton herself could never quite decide who was right
4692072 bravo michael dijo spitz frente a un phelps casi ruborizado te observ ya en atenas y entonces me dije que pod as lograrlo puesto que no tuviste miedo de enfrentar a un monstruo como ian thorpe tu motivaci n es extraordinaria
4692073 para mi es un honor estar contigo en este d a aunque m s no sea mediante la conexi n televisiva felicitaciones estoy muy orgulloso de ti
4692074 recuerda que tiene una gran responsabilidad pues eres un ejemplo para miles de personas en todo el mundo en su mayor a j venes
4692075 the doctor told me if i waited even a few months i would probably be dead
4692076 my father loved me no matter what but to my mother i was an embarrassment
4692077 one little boy said lady does it hurt to be that fat i told him that if it had happened all at once it probably would have of course his mother was horrified
4692078 once when i was in a mall a woman came up to me and told me i had no business being out in public i didnt know what to say
4692079 i would see the pity in peoples eyes and it was so awful
4692080 i would always be self conscious about what i ate because i didnt want people to see me eating a lot and thinking worse of me i would never go to an all you can eat place
4692081 why bariatric surgery didnt work so well even 20 years ago is that we failed to address the psychological issues and the need for support beforehand
4692082 i describe the procedure as a tool like a rake
4692083 if you leave the rake leaning against the wall it doesnt work
4692084 one of the dilemmas of people addicted to food unlike people addicted to chemicals is they have to continue to eat they cant become abstinent
4692085 when i had kids i spent some of that time on welfare so what i could afford was cheap and high calorie
4692086 in middle school the kids threw me into lockers and called me names
4692087 not that long ago somebody said if i looked like you id kill myself
4692088 i tell him he eats to live we live to eat
4692089 the hundreds of people who show up at our office openings the thousands who make phone calls for us thats the story of the campaign thats the story of this election thats how were going to win florida
4692090 we are implementing a proven strategy that was successful in 2000 and 2004 and our team is being led by experienced operatives and volunteers who know how to win elections in florida
4692091 we are directly contacting thousands of florida voters every day both over the phone and in person we know how to get out the vote on election day
4692092 they dont feel their vote makes a difference theyre unsure how to participate or for young people their lives are busy and they dont feel they have that much at stake
4692093 in 10 or 15 years when theyre married have a few kids and a house and are paying taxes theyll vote
4692094 if somebody reaches out to them personally somebody they already know
4692095 were going to win one door knock at a time
4692096 every poll shows that florida is once again the premier battleground state in the country
4692097 wont somebody help me what theyre trying to do can somebody help me what theyre trying to do
4692098 oh no not you again mashing up my life it was bad the first time yeah you had me in a vice
4692099 i wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky
4692100 it is a red light telling us that something is beginning to go wrong with the quality of water
4692101 algae is the first thing to be affected by a change in water quality
4692102 treatment methods borrowed from medicine are taking hold in perfumeries
4692103 an ultrasound device whose wavees penetrate deep enough to be effective would cost far too much
4692104 a rich cream then can be easily worked into the skin
4692105 such a treatment should be done only once every six weeks
4692106 if a microdermabrasion is to be really effective a lay person must be careful
4692107 in the worst case it can leave chemical burns on the skin
4692108 the skin of our test subjects looked exactly the same after a treatment as before the money can be saved for other purposes
4692109 everything that the cosmetic industry offers in skin care products on the shelf is sufficient for taking care of normal skin
4692110 we are delighted to make our first foray into the middle east market with oman as our launch pad
4692111 though there are three most beautiful girls in the film ranbir simply rocks in the film be it the music video or the khuda jaane song
4692112 ranbirs dresses and looks change with time and have been worked upon a lot he can be seen trying all sorts of clothes that one can expect a guy from the age of 19 to 30 to wear
4692113 styling was very exciting and challenging as all three actresses are of different types and come at different times in ranbirs life so the styling had to be unique for everyone with no overlapping but one thing i can assure you all the looks would be unique and will have an aki stamp on it
4692114 minissha plays a small town girl from amritsar so i kept in mind the influences on fashion in amritsar her look in the film with the patiala salwars ganjee tops and jackets have already become a rage
4692115 she is the most fashionable girl from a metro with all the latest trends in fashion she can be seen wearing shorts jeans and other trendy dresses
4692116 there is always a bonus if we have an actress like bipasha in the film she is one of the best looking women with great attitude and an amazing body and her fashion background does makes a difference
4692117 her clothes are very functional its shirts high waist skinny jeans white legged jeans and has a tough look deepikas skinny jeans are the hottest thing right now
4692118 siddharth anand the director asked me to keep the look of the film young trendy and vibrant he said it has to be a hip hot and sexy looking film which it has finally turned out to be
4692119 kareena has a fantastic sense of attitude and style and she can carry off anything in the world
4692120 we will be showcasing a limited edition of our new concept steel silk in new york sept 15
4692121 steel silk thread is our innovation and it is a different and beautiful concept putumayo liked our collection and approached us to design wearable art line for them
4692122 we do not follow any norms and trends we create something that is classic and timeless we choose to be different
4692123 we feel restless if we keep on doing the same thing every year we believe in breaking boundaries to come up with something new every season
4692124 there is a niche market for art pieces in india but in the west designers love indian designs and cuts through this association we want to promote indian art there
4692125 these designs are not meant for the masses because they cant relate to art unlike designers who know how much of hard work has to be put in to come up with wearable art designs
4692126 we are not participating because the dates are clashing with the launch of our label in the us
4692127 if that continues youll see a much larger base on our monthly postpaid plans
4692128 the successful debut of their hop1800 disposable cell phone at last weeks sic 90th pga championship game
4692129 i include mike ds comments in this weeks wotw in order to invite commentary and clarification on the issue and because im pretty sure mike d is the only longtime faithful wotw reader in the world not necessarily a compliment
4692130 terrorism is the best political weapon for nothing drives people harder than a fear of sudden death
4692131 mossad provoked americas air strike on libya in 1986 by making it appear that terrorist orders were being transmitted from the libyan government to its embassies
4692132 the proposed acquisition diminishes the ability of small regional and new wireless carriers to obtain automatic roaming issue has been an ongoing point of contention for rural carriers that have been unable to offer data services to their customers when those customers roam outside of their home network
4692133 as customers try new and increasingly complex wireless phone services and products such as playing mp3 files capturing still pictures or video or downloading ringtones they are more likely to call their provider for support
4692134 customer care centers and service representatives are under pressure to handle the increase in inquiries while still trying to understand and resolve the customers issue on the initial contact
4692135 we tested infineons 3g solution in a lab in february and it was rock solid i think its more of an implementation issue
4692136 its expensive to make a baseband solution for a single customer unless you have the scale of iphone 3g it found a baseband of
4692137 id lean more toward a theory of teething pains with new but non proprietary 3g chips and software along with what may be a newly loaded 3g network infrastructure
4692138 there are so many potential layers to these alleged performance issues that im not about to point any fingers
4692139 there are many discerning people writing about new products such as the iphone and it does have a major impact on companies brands
4692140 public relations people at major corporations tell me they now spend as much time with bloggers as they do with traditional media and they monitor the blogs
4692141 my sense is that its hard for steve jobs to acknowledge a problem
4692142 that may be arrogance my guess is that hell fix this with a software update
4692143 if their oem customers bypass them to work directly with providers of cellular baseband ics who supply reference designs and related support separate modules are no longer required and their reason for existing disappears
4692144 we do not have a time table other than for it to be open right now
4692145 any activities taking place pre close are driven by helio name would disappear wallace wouldnt provide specifics
4692146 the gaming market has enormous potential to extend brands across platforms
4692147 and connect 2 media is well positioned to exploit this
4692148 motorolas physical designs havent been the problem even today its products are physically attractive the user interface and underlying software however is where apple has a tremendous advantage
4692149 steve jobs understands very well what his set of customers want thats as much art as science data helps but consumers dont always know what they want until you show it to them
4692150 motorolas numbers are coming in at a point where motorolas portfolio will be 50 3g going forward up from 15 today also lends credence to the potential for a turnaround to build in coming quarters joy said
4692151 now they have a capable leader and its an execution game
4692152 i think theyre intent on spinning off the handset division
4692153 sanjay wants to lead a public company and his compensation is geared towards rewarding a spin off
4692154 oh war das knapp mir sind mehrere steine vom herzen gefallen ich war am herzkasper
4692155 wir haben sehr stark begonnen es dann aber vers umt das dritte tor zu machen nach dem anschlusstreffer des hsv haben wir nicht mehr den druck entwickeln k nnen
4692156 auf dauer werden wir spieler wie ribery oder toni nicht ersetzen k nnen
4692157 wir sollten das richtig einordnen die bayern sind noch nicht bei 100 prozent
4692158 das freut mich nat rlich ganz besonders f r unsere nationalspieler ist es wichtig dass sie spielpraxis bekommen
4692159 e perci la licenza di poter agire come si vuole e pare in pratica linvestitura di dio contro linfedele che in questo caso sarebbe la parte politicamente opposta
4692160 tutti gli altri i primi detengono il potere i benefici e le ricchezze i secondi sono oggetti pratici per le finalit dei primi e la guerra in
4692161 what are the pros cons of a drum riser in this room and what exactly is the main purpose of one
4692162 es mi segunda medalla ol mpica y doy gracias a dios por haberme permitido estar en cinco juegos y haber terminado as mi carrera
4692163 estoy muy contento estaba un poco nervioso antes de la carrera pero fue mi mejor prueba
4692164 hoy termina un paraguay exclusivo secretista con fama de corrupci n hoy se inicia la historia de un paraguay cuyas autoridades y pobladores ser n implacables con los ladrones de su pueblo con acciones que nublen la transparencia y con aquellos pocos due os feudales de un raro pa s del ayer enclavado en el presente
4692165 es tiempo de mirar hacia delante y trabajar denodadamente la ingenier a colectiva del futuro del paraguay no ser tarea f cil el sendero estar empedrado de obst culos que permanentemente pretender n cegarnos con los espejismos del reciente pasado dictatorial
4692166 el cambio no es una cuesti n electoral es una apuesta cultural quiz s la m s importante en su historia
4692167 so amos con un paraguay socialmente justo donde nunca m s exista tanta inequidad que convierte a los unos en adversarios de los otros
4692168 por aquellos que la historia hab a arrojado en los marginales escenarios de la exclusi n y la miseria
4692169 mucho m s temprano que tarde se abrir n las grandes alamedas por donde pasar el hombre libre para construir una sociedad mejor
4692170 we shouldnt make any moral judgments on this war stopping the war thats what were interested in
4692171 we dont see anything that supports the russians are in gori i dont know why the georgians are saying that
4692172 i dont think he knew who took it when he called
4692173 when i first found out i was excited and kind of scared of the high schoolers but now that i know what to do im just excited
4692174 they were asking wheres this and wheres that and running in little packs giggling and carrying on the kids were really excited
4692175 they may have an occasional class in the regular high school but its basically a separate facility
4692176 it shouldnt be too large of an adjustment for anyone because the buildings are familiar
4692177 the students have been in them in some capacity before
4692178 it seems like every summer is busier than the last and thats certainly true for this one
4692179 so the exact time for pickup and drop offs can only be estimated until we try it
4692180 it will be quite a change for the bartlett and cutler students who may have had 70 to 90 students at their school
4692181 there may be a little confusion in the first few days but our bus drivers our teachers and our staff are all very loving caring people who want to do the best for the kids and will try to make everyone welcome
4692182 laughery accomplished her crimes in the california case in part by creating fictitious accounts for the purpose of laundering and disguising transfers of stock or cash
4692183 i was always coming back unless i was a top round pick or something like that
4692184 we won the north and were ranked no 1 in the nation but we lost in the big 12 championship game we want to fix that
4692185 definitely last year set the foundation for what were trying to do this year
4692186 it was exciting last year it was a once in a lifetime season and were trying to do it again this year
4692187 you look at a team and quarterbacks are judged one thing and thats wins
4692188 it doesnt matter about the heisman or anything the only thing that is important to me is to go out there and be the best i can for our team
4692189 football is the greatest team sport there has ever been except for one position
4692190 we all know at the quarterback position that guy has got to be special if you want to win that guy has got to be a difference maker type player if you want to win a big 12 championship or go on to the bcs
4692191 when a quarterback plays at the level that chase does it increases your chances of winning he had good people around him a year ago and hes got good people around him this year we all know one guy wont be the difference at this level but if you want to win championships you need a guy who can take it to another level and chase does that for us
4692192 i didnt think it would happen last year i thought it would happen this year when we got everything ready
4692193 it happened kind of fast but i knew we were going to be good we did it a little faster than i thought we would
4692194 they have a different theme every year and its always unique theyve had a waterfall before
4692195 we like seeing the local bands and the football team we pretty much know everybody in them
4692196 its about the same every year this year the weather is perfect for it
4692197 like this year a clown came by and hugged me a little bit ago i didnt see that coming
4692198 shampoo or not pet tips from hsn amp prince lorenzo borghese video
4692199 to get the crowd to get into the game with us we need every little help that we can get it gets us motivated
4692200 i dont know how they do it in hawaii shes a ball of energy so people thrive off of it she comes in sometimes she doesnt have to touch the ball shes accelerating the fans love it
4692201 the players handled it very well the team coached itself in the locker room
4692202 i was just concerned with getting over there before the runner did
4692203 you can take melkys name and exchange it with a lot of guys on this field right now that are making a hell of a lot more money than melky cabrera
4692204 theyre better than what they have showed too but in this case melky had options and i have a guy who is pushing his way into the mix in brett gardner so in melkys case i had a choice i could make
4692205 in the other guys cases we can just keep running their names in the lineup keep making sure they go through the processes they should and hope for better results
4692206 melky cabrera i believe without a doubt is an everyday major league center fielder
4692207 but he has struggled for an extended period of time and placed his spot in jeopardy to have to be sent down and someone else behind the scences brett gardner has pushed himself into the conversation
4692208 its hard to look at the future right now because i am looking so hard right now at 08
4692209 now i just have to go back and down and work hard and try and get back here
4692210 helo fellow nigerian home and abroad this is bringing to you the latest naija music
4692211 we were talking as a staff the urgency of every day has to be so vital its condensed and fast
4692212 its a pretty competitive camp guys have a chance to continue to make it tough on us in cincinnati and cleveland
4692213 im competing for a spot out here and trying to make a team
4692214 the next couple of games are huge for me ive got to get out there and make some plays and produce
4692215 unless we go out and get bob feller don drysdale and sandy koufax i think youd have to say that as of right now hes earned a spot in the rotation
4692216 funny things happen there could be trades there could be free agents i dont know how all that will play out but as of now id have to say hes earned a spot
4692217 because hes learned how to hold runners learned how to be deceptive how to slide step hes made a lot of adjustments some of them here a lot of them down at toledo he studies the hitters too im happy for him and proud of him hes more than earned his keep
4692218 if i have to push him back a day i will theres time to make that decision
4692219 for us its more of a mental thing than anything
4692220 if we wanted to we could have just thrown a couple of completions to get it over with
4692221 we have to push through all the knick knack bruises and injures that everybody has
4692222 when you finally get in and play during the season you remember what youre doing it for
4692223 we cant hide from it we have to put our names on it
4692224 but we live and we learn you always want to get better not worse this time i feel like we have things going the right pieces to the puzzle and its time to rush get some interceptions and win around here
4692225 this game will really check the oil on our defense
4692226 not so much the passing game theyre a good passing team but they are a physical team you couldnt ask for something better for us we need to line up against a huge line our quickness has to be there
4692227 once we do that then we can do what we do me and the whole d line have been really working on getting to the quarterback
4692228 for any citizen with time to spare and a jenny block mythical monogamy why honesty in relationships is always the best policy washington famed chef julia child shared a secret with supreme court alan au is 57
4692229 did you see it did you see i got it
4692230 keep it down i think my old mans coming home
4692231 keep it down do you want him to hear you
4692232 what ever you do dont make any sound and dont come out
4692233 the last player we will want to sell is james milner and i am talking about the owner mike ashley and myself and i am sure he will not be leaving st james park
4692234 after that there will be nobody else going out and we want one or two more coming in
4692235 and what we have to do is to make sure we get better players coming in than those who are going out and this will take some doing because they are quality players who are going out
4692236 the idea is to put on the field to play our game in a way that is as similar as brazilian football as we can but i have players who are made for english football their characteristics are different
4692237 we will try to learn about dribbling controlling the ball passing the ball touching the ball and one twos but i need to respect the identity of the players and the quality of the players we have some players who play similar to those in brazil but others dont
4692238 abramovich wants chelsea to play very well and win the fans are the same its not just mr abramovich
4692239 but they need to understand that sometimes it is difficult to play beautifully and win sometimes it is impossible because the other team plays a different style
4692240 it is my style and i have been a coach now for 24 25 years i try to play very well and win but if you dont win people forget that you played very well people kill you you can play very well for one or two months then you dont win then its over
4692241 i will try to be very clear over the barry situation everyone has been talking and it seems that the blame is put on me
4692242 i get blamed for everything for global warming to high petrol prices
4692243 but in this case i want to be very clear since i talked to martin oneill about the situation in april i have not talked to anyone at aston villa
4692244 all the talks have been between our chief executive rick parry the owner and the chief executive of aston villa and those talks have all been pretty good
4692245 so if anyone wants to talk about barry in the future they must talk with the owner rick parry or the chief executive of aston villa and as i have said those talks i understand have been good
4692246 i was not involved in the talks about barry i was not involved in the talks about xabi alonso and arsenal if you want to talk about these players you must talk to the chief executive of our club who was handling the discussions
4692247 if you want to talk about players then you talk to rick parry if you want to talk about football then you talk with me
4692248 keane has been training really well really hard but he will need time to get used to his team mates and torres
4692249 but i have no problems with him he can play up front with torres or in behind it will depend on the game
4692250 ive been on waivers all my career lots of times
4692251 manny ramirez and a lot of good players have been on waivers
4692252 it started ugly and got worse at the end we had a lot of hits 11 swung the bats better than the score showed but you obviously have to pitch better than we pitched
4692253 if this is a rich development environment give me poverty
4692254 the virtual communities created by online games have provided us with a new medium for social interaction and communication avatar machine is a system which replicates the aesthetics and visuals of third person gaming allowing the user to view themselves as a virtual character in real space via a head mounted interface the system potentially allows for a diminished sense of social responsibility and could lead the user to demonstrate behaviors normally reserved for the gaming environment
4692255 everyones getting into a tizzy about the return of the
4692256 it s time to reinstitute the fairness doctrine said senate majority whip dick durbin d ill i have this old fashioned attitude that when americans hear both sides of the story they re in a better position to make a decision
4692257 should the media allow equal time for liberal and conservative ideas
4692258 the problem is 30 of americans support all sorts of foolishness
4692259 now that obamas going to be the nominee im looking forward to seeing where he stands on the issues
4692260 the obama campaign would like me to let you know

4692269 the pickoff the bunt that comes down to execution to two parts

4692271 metrics should not override audit quality and in some instances we may have let metrics compromise performance of an audit in accordance with the auditing standards
4692272 process of issuing guidance on independent audit services that may be provided by dcaa during an ipt
4692273 to recognize this initiative we request that each office hold a stand down day this month in which audit quality is discussed as a group
4692274 the regional director or deputy regional director will participate in these conferences to further emphasize expectations and answer questions or concerns on audit quality
4692275 suffer or be jeopardized by external factors or internal factors e g agency metrics
4692276 it is imperative that all employees cooperate fully with the reviewers
4692277 employees at all levels in the organization should feel free to have open and candid discussion with the evaluators
4692278 audit independence was not impacted by pressures from either the contractor or buying command
4692279 dcaa is one of the few government organizations that holds its employees to high standards day in and day out
4692280 it takes personnel actions against employess that do not perform up to standards i have seen poor performing auditors come and go the poor performing auditors always blame management and complain about the lack of budget hours and due dates that cannot be met it is smoke and mirrors
4692281 spain came out and played really hard you have to give them credit
4692282 it was a matter that our defense controls so much of what our offense does
4692283 spains a good team they came out really well in the first half
4692284 in the second half we came out defensively and took care of what we had to
4692285 stuff like that happens during a game when both teams are playing physical you just step up hit your free throws and move on
4692286 i had to get a little treatment on the side but once it got warm i was okay
4692287 for us this was a good game its what we wanted to have
4692288 it was great when spain made their run and at the end of the first half were sitting there with a five point lead to see how were going to respond in that situation
4692289 i always compare it to when steve perry went and did oh sherrie which is a fucking journey song
4692290 it sounded exactly like journey and thats fucked up i dont want to do that
4692291 i feel like im waving the flag for musicianship trying to bring back bands that can play
4692292 it seems like a lot of music today is so churned out and simple i like playing these festivals because its one thing all day and then here i come on and everyones like whoa then back to the grind
4692293 it sounds like a banjo but they sing with it and its the most fucking passionate emotional music ive ever heard in my life
4692294 i want to include that in my album because its so passionate like when you hear a korn song and its really going crazy these guys do it with a stringy banjo i want to bring that to kids here who are like what the fuck is this and open their minds up to something different
4692295 its no secret that i had my problems during my last few years in korn
4692296 there were drug issues and i just wasnt enjoying the music any more thats why im so excited about this album i poured everything i had into it and i think ive really connected with the fans which was one of the primary purposes for doing it hopefully it will inspire those who hear it i hope they feel the magic again the same kind of feeling that i now have
4692297 its great that everyone agreed that flush should be the albums first single
4692298 it talks about flushing the bad things out of your life and trying to get a fresh start thats the story of my life over the last few years as i look back on everything i went through in korn all the drugs and alcohol i guess the bottom line is that im glad im not dead i apparently survived all of that for a reason and hopefully im fulfilling some of that now
4692299 life is boring simple story get drunk throw up sleep all day i am something im not nothing i cant let myself decay
4692300 heres a song yall all know if you dont fucking know this song youre not a korn fan

4692331 wait a minute i come to you with good students with good grades and records that have serious concerns and you say theres nothing to it but when a known troublemaker with a long history comes and says something about bill eller you all take her at her word and run with it
4692332 i wonder what this girl has on the administration that they keep letting her get away with things
4692333 you dont understand the needs of the students we serve now
4692334 you have no abnormal problems at hhs warranting any special attention
4692335 you cant discipline all kids anymore you have to reason with them
4692336 the eller case wasnt even scheduled to be heard during the meeting
4692337 this is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it
4692338 i dont think theres anything more unseemly than the sight of a rock star in academic robes its a bit like when people put their king charles spaniels in little tartan sweats and hats its not natural and it doesnt make the dog any smarter

4692359 held on 260 000 00 bond on charges including cocaine possession attempt to sell cocaine and traffic charges
4692360 what we think is we need to have a real debate about the issue and that includes a real look at the costs of some of the policies being promoted
4692361 lets look at taking whatever revenue is derived from that and devote it entirely to tax relief
4692362 we think that there are solutions to whatever the climate crisis may be that are market based that dont involve increasing the size of government substantially
4692363 do we want to create a model where the solutions for dependence on oil come out of europe or asia and were sitting here in the u s because we want to argue for the status quo
4692364 the scientific data show the change is accelerating so when you do take measures the longer you delay the more aggressive those measures have to be
4692365 its important to address those issues sooner rather than later
4692366 if the united states congress would have the backbone enough to announce to this world that we are going to deregulate and we are going to begin to drill and refine american oil we would begin to see gas prices plummet

4692372 i will fight tooth and nail against anyone who tries to make me accept it because i will be too lost if this doesnt happen
4692373 okay im not going to be president but how about vice president or something so i dont have to face having nothing
4692374 its all real its not a bad dream i am lost and dont feel like doing anything else everybody just leave me alone
4692375 okay i guess i dont have nothing i still have my family i still have people who believed in me i still have a job in the senate i can still make a difference
4692376 my core value and life has been to be of service my daddy did and so have i for most of my adult life i like being an educator on the problems of global warming but i may actually have more leverage to help that and other initiatives as president and besides i will agree if elected to only serve one term where one of my most important roles is to mentor barack obama to be the real president who makes change happen after i leave office in 2012

4692380 gender stereotypes trump race stereotypes in every social science test
4692381 the deal is that women generally fall into two alternatives they are seen as either nice but stupid or smart but mean
4692382 contact doesnt undermine these stereotypes and it might even strengthen them
4692383 many people dont believe seeing women as kind or soft is a stereotype theyre not going to question it because they believe its a good thing
4692384 the measure of a civilization is how it treats those who have hurt it

4692388 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4692389 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4692390 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4692391 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4692392 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4692393 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4692394 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4692395 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4692396 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4692397 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4692398 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4692399 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4692400 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4692401 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4692402 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4692403 the war was my fault 9 11 was my fault anytime something bad happens a new death toll in the war or whatever my e mails start getting filled up again
4692404 i understand why people care but its like weve got to move on
4692405 i guess you can guess who im not endorsing not supporting
4692406 ive lent my crystal ball to someone so i cant give you the figure
4692407 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4692408 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4692409 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4692410 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4692411 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4692412 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
4692413 many in the christian right tend to get their information
4692414 these robotic policemen wiped out all of cambridge in one day of carnage what have you got to say about that
4692415 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4692416 recycling is recycling glass should be included its not about making money its about making difference
4692417 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4692418 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4692419 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4692420 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
4692421 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view
4692422 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4692423 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4692424 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4692425 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
4692426 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
4692427 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
4692428 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4692429 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4692430 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4692431 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4692432 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4692433 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4692434 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4692435 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4692436 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4692437 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4692438 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4692439 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4692440 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4692441 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4692442 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4692443 north pole may be ice free for first time this summer
4692444 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
4692445 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
4692446 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
4692447 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
4692448 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
4692449 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
4692450 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
4692451 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
4692452 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
4692453 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
4692454 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4692455 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
4692456 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
4692457 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
4692458 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
4692459 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
4692460 just so you all know we did set a record
4692461 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
4692462 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4692463 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
4692464 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
4692465 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
4692466 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
4692467 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
4692468 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
4692469 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4692470 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
4692471 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
4692472 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
4692473 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
4692474 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
4692475 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
4692476 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
4692477 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
4692478 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
4692479 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
4692480 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
4692481 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
4692482 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
4692483 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
4692484 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
4692485 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
4692486 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
4692487 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
4692488 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
4692489 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4692490 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
4692491 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
4692492 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
4692493 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
4692494 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
4692495 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
4692496 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
4692497 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
4692498 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
4692499 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
4692500 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4692501 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4692502 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4692503 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4692504 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4692505 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4692506 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4692507 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4692508 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4692509 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4692510 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4692511 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4692512 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4692513 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4692514 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4692515 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4692516 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4692517 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4692518 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4692519 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4692520 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4692521 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4692522 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4692523 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4692524 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4692525 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4692526 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4692527 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4692528 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4692529 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4692530 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4692531 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
4692532 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4692533 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4692534 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
4692535 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source
4692536 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
4692537 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
4692538 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
4692539 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4692540 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4692541 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4692542 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4692543 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4692544 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
4692545 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
4692546 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
4692547 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
4692548 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
4692549 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
4692550 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
4692551 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
4692552 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
4692553 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
4692554 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
4692555 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
4692556 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
4692557 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
4692558 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
4692559 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
4692560 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4692561 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4692562 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4692563 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
4692564 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
4692565 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
4692566 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
4692567 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
4692568 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
4692569 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
4692570 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
4692571 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
4692572 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
4692573 once again we have an opportunity to take a giant leap for humankind
4692574 when we send money to foreign countries to buy nearly 70 percent of the oil we use every day they build new skyscrapers and we lose jobs when we spend that money building solar arrays and windmills we build competitive industries and gain jobs here at home
4692575 i have long supported a sharp reduction in payroll taxes with the difference made up in co2 taxes we should tax what we burn not what we earn this is the single most important policy change we can make
4692576 we must recognize those who have toiled in dangerous conditions to bring us our present energy supply we should guarantee good jobs in the fresh air and sunshine for any coal miner displaced by impacts on the coal industry
4692577 in recent years our politics has tended toward incremental proposals made up of small policies designed to avoid offending special interests alternating with occasional baby steps in the right direction our democracy has become sclerotic at a time when these crises require boldness
4692578 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
4692579 more than any time in history mankind faces a crossroads one path leads to despair and utter hopelessness the other to total extinction let us pray that we have the wisdom to choose correctly
4692580 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4692581 says he has all the answers and it will only cost 3 trillion
4692582 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
4692583 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
4692584 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
4692585 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
4692586 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
4692587 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
4692588 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
4692589 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
4692590 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
4692591 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
4692592 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
4692593 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
4692594 who invited the trouble here who invited this arrogance here who invited these innocent deaths here
4692595 not only those people who perpetrate them are responsible but also those people who failed to stop it
4692596 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4692597 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4692598 bridges to nowhere than the one in alaska and there are more builders of such bridges than those built by alaskas defendant senator
4692599 giving up tv entirely would be a little ridiculous but if the big media companies can augment tv coverage with more detailed or more obscure coverage on the web thats a winning formula
4692600 kami telah meminta pimpinan pt kai untuk membawa masinis kedua lokomotif kereta api itu baik ka babaranjang maupun ka bisnis limex serta petugas pengatur sinyal agar dapat memberikan keterangan yang diperlukan

4692606 let us wait until the light of the morning then we will kill him
4692607 coax him and find out what makes his strength so great and how we may overpower him so that we may bind him in order to subdue him and we will each give you eleven hundred pieces of silver
4692608 please tell me what makes your strength so great and how you could be bound so that one could subdue you
4692609 if they bind me with seven fresh bowstrings that are not dried out then i shall become weak and be like anyone else
4692610 you have mocked me and told me lies please tell me how you could be bound
4692611 if they bind me with new ropes that have not been used then i shall become weak and be like anyone else
4692612 until now you have mocked me and told me lies tell me how you could be bound
4692613 if you weave the seven locks of my head with the web and make it tight with the pin then i shall become weak and be like anyone else
4692614 now when forty years had passed an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of mount sinai in the flame of a burning bush
4692615 it was this moses whom they rejected when they said who made you a ruler and a judge
4692616 but god turned away from them and handed them over to worship the host of heaven as it is written in the book of the prophets did you offer to me slain victims and sacrifices forty years in the wilderness o house of israel
4692617 the danger posed by terrorism has become a matter of grave concern at the international and national levels
4692618 we have repeatedly made known our views that these obstacles must be overcome through consensus and discussions with all concerned
4692619 we will have to ensure that the trend is maintained

4692644 maka disebabkan rahmat dari allah lah kamu berlaku lemah lembut kepada mereka sekiranya kamu bersikap keras lagi berhati kasar tentu mereka menjauhkan diri dari sekelilingmu
4692645 maka berbicaralah kamu berdua kepadanya dengan kata kata yang lemah lembut mudah mudahan ia ingat atau takut
4692646 serulah manusia kepada jalan rabbmu dengan hikmah dan nasehat yang baik dan bantahlah mereka dengan cara yang lebih baik
4692647 sesungguhnya kelembutan itu tidak akan ada pada sesuatu melainkan dia akan menghiasinya dan tidak akan tercabut dari sesuatu melainkan dia akan menjadi jelek
4692648 barangsiapa terhalang dari sikap lembut maka ia berarti terhalang dari kebaikan seluruhnya
4692649 its pointless to look at this data second by second
4692650 i had to come up with a mathematical way to understand the brain activity
4692651 the question now becomes whether evolution has gone through the trouble of selecting for these particular patterns more than once
4692652 if you want escapism it is sometimes necessary to flee the screening rooms altogether
4692653 there are rather strict rules about how you name new species as long as these rules are followed you can give a new species just about any name you please with regards to neil young i really enjoy his music and have a great appreciation of him as an activist for peace and justice
4692654 come we go down a solas market come we go buy banana
4692655 obviously we came at a bad time because the city seems like theyre trying to cut their budget
4692656 this thing has been in the family since the date on the note and it has never been repaid
4692657 i showed it to the attorney and he said it looked very interesting
4692658 it was an incredible result in the end to secure mine and my daughters future and that of all the charities that i obviously plan on helping and making a difference with because you know it has been my life for 20 years
4692659 obviously the court do not want a litigant in person to do well its against everything that they ever wish so when they write the judgment up theyre never going to make it look in favor
4692660 she has called me many many names before even meeting me when i was in a wheelchair
4692661 both of us still care about each other very much
4692662 im honored to get the chance were in the middle of a historic election the economy is going through its worst time in a generation and there are big changes on the world scene
4692663 deeply upsetting for its victims and should not be dealt with lightly
4692664 people rightly expect that offenders who invade their home will be dealt with severely and they have little confidence in weak community sentences which too often arent even properly enforced
4692665 it is entirely the wrong way to go and i hope judges take no notice of it the law abiding public has lost all faith in the criminal justice system and so have i
4692666 a presumption in favour of a community order is most likely to be appropriate in relation to the less serious offences of theft and dishonesty burglary and motoring offences where there may be clear advantages in a sentence in the community
4692667 the risk that an offender may commit further offences of a non serious nature should not automatically indicate that custody is necessary
4692668 punishments should fit the crime and not the availability of prison places
4692669 panels like this think more about the criminals than the victims and yet it is the victims who spend the rest of their lives suffering
4692670 he was convinced that beauty was a luxury that every man and woman needed
4692671 but he was someone who was very shy and introverted who had only very few friends and hid himself from the world

4692673 all designers have a bit of the megalomaniac in them the only difference is that the fake designers the bad ones are happy megalomaniacs while the real ones are unhappy megalomaniacs despite the personal demons his business empire thrived the 1989 flotation was a runaway success but when the gulf war erupted and the world economy slumped in the early 1990s berge and in 1992 ysl was absorbed by cosmetics and drugs company sanofi with saint laurent retaining creative control then in 1999 it was bought by the gucci group itself controlled by french luxury giant ppr what does it matter what you say about people
4692674 the nicest man to work with that ever lived in movies
4692675 03 bonnie and over claims made in her autobiography that he was arrested twice for drunken driving while they were making the 1986 film
4692676 since he has never been arrested for drink driving dog theft or anything else
4692677 what marc wanted and the producers and what i wanted is to bring back a visual flair to the movie
4692678 i told him that i was sorry and i told him that i myself would be very disturbed
4692679 none of us wants to have a circumstance where any americans passport files are looked at in an unauthorized way
4692680 this is an outrageous breach of security and privacy even from an administration that has shown little regard for either over the last eight years
4692681 like so many architecture lovers i believe the whitney and the breuer building are one
4692682 being old enough to have lived through several recessions when i made the decision years ago i asked my financial advisers to move the money into t bills
4692683 it will now be the first time our endowment will be large enough so that the whitney can maintain its commitment to living artists and to adventurous programming
4692684 it has already generated tremendous support on the part of the trustees
4692685 we are studying the idea of a comprehensive whitney trying to see how the two programs would work
4692686 fina approved the suits in agreement with the manufacturers and thats the situation
4692687 the only thing we can say is that we have followed the rules and done everything we can do sometimes controversy helps get more publicity for a sport but its still the athletes that have to do the swimming
4692688 all the major manufacturers will have special rooms set up at the pool where they can keep their equipment
4692689 they will be available to all of the athletes free of charge
4692690 we swam together in college and we were roommates for one year theres always been a great rivalry there
4692691 it has made us get faster and faster together over the years it think it was motivation for me and motivation for her
4692692 has never really been that awkward in a lot of ways we respect each other
4692693 it goes back and forth a lot of times itll be her one minute and me the next i think we keep each other on our toes
4692694 obviously im a little disappointed everybody goes in the race wanting to win but its an improvement on my bronze in the 100 so overall im very happy
4692695 she withdrew just as a precaution to make sure she could continue with competition
4692696 with 6 11m she was one of the better ones but she needed a strong jump because her javelin isnt as good as her jump events
4692697 but shell be ok and shell be right for the 800m tonight
4692698 i was trying to run as slow as i could and advance
4692699 come back and see me im here everyday for lunch
4692700 any time you can get a win against a caliber club like the white sox are its definitely huge
4692701 i knew at the worst it was going to be a sacrifice fly our team battled to the end
4692702 we really havent had a ton of excitement the last few weeks to that magnitude so it was big
4692703 we obviously played a long game yesterday and knowing weve got a day game tomorrow we didnt need to play those extra innings
4692704 carrasco actually threw me all sliders up until a fastball that was up and in that was the only fastball i saw the whole count except for that last pitch
4692705 we couldnt get anything going after the first inning their pitching held us down everybody in this clubhouse knows this was a tough loss we dont have to dwell on it
4692706 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
4692707 the singer songwriter sued mccain and the ohio and national republican committees in u s district court in los angeles on thursday accusing them of using his song running on empty without his permission

4692714 lets stop pretending that healing the sick is like trading a commodity lets stop diverting doctors energies into unholy bidding wars for jobs they already do
4692715 its been huge for us we sell artwork and diy kits all over the world and so put virtually all our marketing energy into our website we get well over five thousand visitors every month at basically no cost and the whole world has become our target market
4692716 weve gotten to the point where the money we take in on propositions equals the game handle
4692717 right now we have a bunch out linked to tiger woods the worlds no 1 golfer who was tied for the lead going into the fourth round of the dubai desert classic
4692718 we had to rethink the situation and our decision was to put up a hundred props only in our case to link them all to the game
4692719 i dont know what the big deal is but it seems important to have more propositions and to get them up faster than jay kornegay
4692720 there are so many places for bettors to pick their spots
4692721 we can take a little break before we start on the second half betting lines
4692722 given the pattern of the thing its not unreasonable for people to ask
4692723 the media and a large chunk of the public including some of johns supporters still question whether hes told the whole truth
4692724 happy to take a paternity test and would love to see it happen
4692725 i feel sorry for his family because how horrible but also dont you think he is the father of the child
4692726 anybody whos been around campaigns knows that folks come and go
4692727 i would only have positive things to say about him as being a helpful friendly and pleasant co worker to a new employee
4692728 they seemed to be crazy about each other they certainly are crazy about their kids and dog
4692729 we all have our ups and we all have our downs and when youre up you reach out and when youre down you allow others to help
4692730 help two friends and former colleagues rebuild their lives when harassment by supermarket tabloids made it impossible for them to move forward on their own
4692731 anybody whos been around campaigns knows that folks come and go
4692732 andrew young who publicly claims to be the father of rielle hunters baby though he hasnt been heard from since john edwardss confession of an affair was moved to santa barbara by the generosity of john edwardss campaign
4692733 andrew young is the father of ms hunters unborn child
4692734 outsiders may think that the tibetans are treated very well and that they are happy but the truth is that tibetans are not free to speak of their suffering
4692735 even if i had to sacrifice my life for this message to be seen by the dalai lama i agree and welcome this chance
4692736 its better for us if you leave the psb police are downstairs and know you are here
4692737 but when you have been here like i have you know the problems at this football club have never been the crowd never been the passion of the people and the support of the club in the city that has always been there through thick and thin thin and thinner it does not surprise me although it always knocks you back because this is newcastle the fans are top rate and my job is to get a team that eventually matches them it is a tough ask and we still have some way to go
4692738 sends out a message if were going to fetch new players in let them be quality
4692739 i am very happy that we have another argentinean at newcastle and i will do all i can to help him
4692740 i know from playing against fabricio in la liga and as a team mate for argentina what a good player he is im just happy were on the same side all of the time now
4692741 with the signing of this accord all russian troops and any paramilitary and irregular troops that entered with them must leave immediately
4692742 moving around to weaken the civilian administration and perhaps create the conditions for political upheaval down the line
4692743 what worries me about this episode is the united states is jeopardizing russian cooperation on a number of issues over a dispute that at most involves limited american interests
4692744 held free elections opened up their economy and built the foundations of a successful democracy
4692745 the people of georgia have cast their lot with the free world
4692746 the best screaming sports phil yoon runs down several baseball bulls and several baseball bears in the screaming sports zach powell breaks out another screaming sports original with so many valuable one picture says it all
4692747 his name is abdul rashid code named abu abdullah he has surrendered with his pika gun and ammunition we wish that as he has returned home other militants should also follow suit and get benefited by governments surrender policy
4692748 i appeal to other colleagues that if they want to lead peaceful lives they should come and surrender like me i have surrendered to the security forces and am sitting here fearlessly with them and having food
4692749 we inquired from the police on the whereabouts of a youth who was taken away by the police they said they do not know anything about him but we know he is with them only there was a heated argument and then some officer ordered to open fire and then there was indiscriminate firing some of the people dived into the water to save their lives
4692750 since we have received the decision and because we are still reviewing it and plan our next course of action i have to reserve comment
4692751 what it looks like to me is like a human ape type creature its not a human and its not an ape its definitely something that weve never seen before
4692752 cant see the nose very well it could be a big foots face that could be one
4692753 ive seen tracks just about every time ive been up there
4692754 we will make you love big brother we will cure you and then well kill you
4692755 kereta saya turut terperangkap di situ namun sekumpulan lelaki menyedari saya berada di dalam kereta dan mereka terus mengepung kereta saya katanya kepada pemberita di sini hari ini
4692756 i just ran the first 50 meters then i looked around to make sure i was safe and i shut it off
4692757 i was starting to hurt a little bit with probably the last 10 meters
4692758 that was my last individual race so i was just trying to finish as strong as i could
4692759 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time hes the greatest racer who ever walked the planet
4692760 shows the dire economic situation for indigenous people in latin america
4692761 i think it shows how bad our trade agreements have worked here we are at the northern border and we have indigenous women dressed in their traditional dresses
4692762 were involved with all the community and part of the community doesnt speak spanish
4692763 lots of luck people at least my wish is something i might get
4692764 help they kidnapped me they wont let me go home or nothing
4692765 i have once again become a medium of violence in the world and once again wish i was not alive
4692766 i know there is good and love in my heart and yet at the same time there is a huge reservoir of hatred evil that drives me to hurt people even those i love
4692767 praying fervently for god to help me but his answers are jumbled and confusing i am driven by my hatred for our society the system while at the same time tortured by my own compassion
4692768 evil is real only because we make it real evil can live in a person and society as well i have been inflicted by an evil demon that is nurtured by our so called criminal justice system but know im still fighting my demons and asking god to guide me as he can
4692769 they found there was no law enforcement purpose to what he was doing
4692770 the plaintiff claimed that he shouldnt have been tased just because he was resisting arrest the jurors had very little trouble dismissing that idea
4692771 talks are going to resume on the sidelines of the sadc summit
4692772 any dialogue that happens will happen within the context of the summit
4692773 of course there isnt power sharing right now but the talks are still going on
4692774 until we find a solution they will continue to go on because sadc doesnt have the luxury of walking away from
4692775 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4692776 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4692777 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4692778 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4692779 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4692780 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4692781 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4692782 we are working together with the convention committee on many levels to ensure a successful convention this year
4692783 as we announced earlier moving forward one of sen obamas reform priorities will include changes in the way party conventions are funded to assure they can be run without dependence
4692784 both conventions are bringing in new fundraisers connected with the presidential candidate to go the last mile
4692785 it indicates to us that our fundraising continues to be very healthy
4692786 so well be spending much more than weve been raising
4692787 john mccains decision to raise money from one of the key figures in the jack abramoff scandal one of abramoffs conspirators in a money laundering scheme is a very disappointing example of john mccain abandoning his principles on the campaign trail
4692788 he claimed to be a reformer well reformer no more
4692789 one can assume that the front six tentacles have the function of arms and that the back two take over the function of legs
4692790 the customers are saying if we pay our money whats going to happen if theres a problem
4692791 there are a lot of unsavory characters involved with these travel agencies
4692792 that would undermine the purpose of the payments which was to avoid public disclosure of the affair
4692793 the idea that edwards finance chairman can independently hand over substantial sums of money to two campaign workers at a time when edwards is a candidate and to argue that that is not related to his campaign is a bit preposterous
4692794 one thing thats possible is that she was still owed money from what shed done before for the political action committee but obviously there are less charitable explanations
4692795 by zacz naprawia szkody w swoich stosunkach ze stanami zjednoczonymi europ i innymi pa stwami by zacz odzyskiwa swoje miejsce w wiecie rosja musi dzia a na rzecz zako czenia tego kryzysu
4692796 despite pledging to run a respectful campaign mccain is just standing by while corsi and his publisher former dick cheney aide mary matalin poison this presidential race
4692797 right now you can take the next step by pushing back on corsi the media and john mccain tackle this smear campaign head on
4692798 obama wants to will all the white blood out of himself so he can become pure black
4692799 unfit for command swift boat veterans speak out against john kerry
4692800 we go into the fall if nothing else a tested organization
4692801 this is like a high stakes trapeze act that these guys have because mistakes and gaffes matter oh so much in these contests
4692802 he has the energy and the forward looking vision to lead
4692803 he has to deal with the ghost on the stage and probably has to do that in a dramatic way
4692804 people will be looking for obama to demonstrate a mastery of the questions
4692805 keeping him on an even keel at all times and not letting the situation rattle him in any way
4692806 he very seldom lets his emotions get the better of him which i think is very helpful
4692807 is a very nuanced thinker and thats good but sometimes in the expression of that it bogs him down a little bit so hes not as direct a speaker or performer as the best debaters have been
4692808 she claims that was the reason she was having problems
4692809 happiness is the meaning and the purpose of life the whole aim and end of human existence
4692810 i want to crawl to her feet whimper to be forgiven for loving me for needing her more than my own life for belonging to her more than my own soul
4692811 if you guess wrong and go to the wrong place first you waste more time and it costs you extra in co pays and fees
4692812 independently we all were getting a little uncomfortable with the level of service that was being provided to the patients in the emergency room
4692813 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words
4692814 i understand where you are coming from but how many real bigfoot researchers are out there trekking 140 000 miles a year
4692815 just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
4692816 they dont have a choice to believe us we have a body
4692817 but thats part of the process everybody waits to squeeze one more drop out of the stone for the most part youre not going to get a deal done five hours before a deadline if you didnt get one five weeks before the deadline you get it done in the last five minutes
4692818 we want him to get as many at bats as possible and then send him to instructional league
4692819 you can draft all the great players you want but it does you no good if you dont sign them
4692820 ownership really stepped up and allowed us to sign two very talented players to go with some guys who already signed and are performing in our system
4692821 it was a long wait seems like it has been forever its exciting to get an opportunity to play for the rangers its unbelievable to me
4692822 im just excited to get the opportunity to go and play baseball again it will be great to get out there and play ball i really want to get up here and play in arlington that would be amazing this is a great ballpark
4692823 we had originally set a time frame that if he werent a little better we were going to do this because watkins is pretty much the best of the best
4692824 i cant describe how excited i am to be a giant
4692825 its been a lifelong dream of mine to get to this point
4692826 well get him some at bats there in arizona before he goes anywhere
4692827 its the first of this type of experience for me so its a little bit different
4692828 i think this is the way you develop a winning organization by bringing in players with the makeup and ability that he has
4692829 given his status hes certainly going to be a candidate but theres no contractual stipulation
4692830 je commen ais tre cuit dans les dix derniers m tres c tait ma derni re course individuelle et je voulais terminer aussi fort que possible a t il ajout jai pens que javais perdu la course mi parcours mais jai r ussi faire la diff rence tout la fin

4692832 theres a lot of stuff regarding him and kates relationship theres a lot of stuff regarding his view on the no shows his view on drugs his view on the arrests and persecution relationships with band members
4692833 but the good thing about it is its not a peter book its a book from our perspective as well about how it affects us
4692834 if youre anything like me you just cant wait for the democrats to put through the
4692835 these detainees are distributed between copper prison which is near the baghdad airport and boca prison in basra
4692836 first in shoes first in booze and last in the american league
4692837 his name is abdul rashid code named abu abdullah he has surrendered with his pika gun and ammunition we wish that as he has returned home other militants should also follow suit and get benefited by governments surrender policy
4692838 i appeal to other colleagues that if they want to lead peaceful lives they should come and surrender like me i have surrendered to the security forces and am sitting here fearlessly with them and having food
4692839 behold all souls are mine as the soul of the father so also the soul of the son is mine the soul that sinneth it shall die
4692840 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4692841 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4692842 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4692843 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4692844 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4692845 i know im going to be playing soon said casilla whose words probably are comforting to twins fans everywhere
4692846 i think it is going to get better he said
4692847 yeah id like to see him play a couple ballgames somewhere and see how he gets through them and maybe join us on our next trip twins manager
4692848 thats kind of my hope not positive on how it is going to work out
4692849 thats a little more pressure and im old enough to be able to handle it
4692850 i tried to help her with it tried to do it up and it ripped again
4692851 the burden of revenge i carried the darkness i was capable of
4692852 what not to do life follows its path we follow lifes path
4692853 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4692854 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4692855 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4692856 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4692857 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4692858 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4692859 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4692860 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4692861 who are open to doing something on the production side
4692862 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4692863 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4692864 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4692865 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4692866 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4692867 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4692868 we are delighted to come to terms with eric hosmer
4692869 we felt that he was the best high school position player in the draft i also have to recognize the support of david and dan glass and the great work of our scouting staff for helping to get eric into our organization
4692870 i was sure that i had a chance to win with this score though it is not my personal best
4692871 you get a little bit stronger sometimes with the adrenaline rush and so you come up a lot quicker and you overshoot your target a little bit
4692872 i like the way these kids get after it for nine innings
4692873 im happy for the team this has been a difficult place for us
4692874 i felt this was my best start since ive been back
4692875 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4692876 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4692877 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4692878 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4692879 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4692880 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4692881 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4692882 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4692883 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4692884 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
4692885 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
4692886 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4692887 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4692888 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4692889 each thing that i would try i would miss and she had a lot of momentum
4692890 i did ok today not really so good or so bad
4692891 my teammate is out and its disappointing because i lost a comrade
4692892 its a relief when you have a teammate with you now i am alone
4692893 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4692894 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4692895 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4692896 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4692897 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4692898 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4692899 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4692900 worldliness has no human magic for him he is not bewitched by rank nor drawn on by conviviality at all
4692901 powerful men who have powerful passions use much of their strength in forging chains for themselves
4692902 though personally one of the kindest men in the world he has often written really in order to hurt not because he hated any particular men he is hardly hot and animal enough for that but because he really hated certain ideas even unto slaying he provokes he will not let people alone one might even say that he bullies only that this would be unfair because he always wishes the other man to hit back
4692903 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4692904 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4692905 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4692906 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4692907 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4692908 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4692909 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4692910 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4692911 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4692912 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4692913 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4692914 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4692915 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4692916 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4692917 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4692918 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4692919 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4692920 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4692921 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4692922 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4692923 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4692924 we werent fully confident we stayed in the game but were still not as good as them
4692925 we have to play to our best to have any kind of a chance but we felt like we played quite well today were satisfied with our performance its just a shame to lose
4692926 we didnt think wed be able to beat hong kong we were so excited
4692927 our goal was to win a medal so tomorrow we have to get back to work
4692928 they played better than me thats all i can say
4692929 i had some problems with receiving the serves that made me feel like i was behind and i also dont think i prepared well enough
4692930 im seeing the ball well and im focusing on that
4692931 it sounds kind of cliche but its true when you can keep it that simple you kind of allow yourself to play kind of get out of your own way
4692932 tonight everyone was just dead we just didnt do our jobs
4692933 hes got electric stuff throwing 97 and 98 mph its hard to hit 97 even if you know its coming he had everything working today
4692934 these are baseball decisions the shakeups got to come from the guys that are expected to perform melky cabrera batting ninth in our lineup is not supposed to be a difference maker in this club either way he was supposed to be able to slide right in while everybody else did their job
4692935 we didnt execute because we didnt execute we didnt win
4692936 at some point you have to start executing if you want to play in october
4692937 s se tendr a que hablar con claridad el seguro escolar viene a ayudar mucho a los padres de familia y a los ni os es una nueva cultura en la que estamos entrando pero s tiene que estar separado de lo otro no lo puede conjuntar con ning n tipo de cuota
4692938 i mean how do you say the charges were a mistake they make a mistake
4692939 from a little spark they try to make a big fire
4692940 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4692941 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4692942 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4692943 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4692944 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4692945 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4692946 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4692947 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4692948 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4692949 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4692950 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4692951 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4692952 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4692953 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4692954 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4692955 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4692956 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4692957 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4692958 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4692959 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4692960 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4692961 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4692962 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4692963 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4692964 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4692965 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4692966 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4692967 tony was involved in the establishment and start up of white amp cases investment funds practice in hong kong and we are delighted he has rejoined us to assist in its continued growth and success
4692968 i was starting to hurt a little bit with probably the last 10 meters that was my last individual race so i was just trying to finish as strong as i could
4692969 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i lost the race there but i guess that was the difference in the race
4692970 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4692971 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4692972 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4692973 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4692974 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4692975 i have known jack and thad for many years having worked with them on a range of energy deals they are both outstanding additions to calpines executive roster and their contracts reflect that

4692980 there have been a lot of emotions since the start of this tour but the image i saw most in my head was this night when i came back to this town
4692981 i was fourth in the qualification with a score of 580
4692982 i was sure that i had a chance to win with this score though it is not my personal best 583 is
4692983 its my focus to try again at age 51 its a very good feeling to get medals
4692984 he came and talked to us last night and watched the tapes of the previous games
4692985 he said he was ready to come back he needed time to take care of his personal business and we respected that but we managed to take care of business on the court while he was gone anyway hes a great guy and its good to have him back

4693003 replacing md 80s with 737s at current fuel prices provides financial benefits while enhancing the customer experience
4693004 boeing and american airlines have enjoyed a partnership that spans more than 50 years back to the beginning of the commercial jet age todays announcement continues that long and successful history
4693005 these additional next generation 737s will enhance americans fleet with newer more efficient airplanes lowering fuel costs and lessening the environmental impact of flying
4693006 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
4693007 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies we are applying for eu u s antitrust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any u s or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
4693008 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry

4693027 just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
4693028 yesterday i paid our latest home heating fuel delivery 1 100 i also paid my 2 000 plus which bought gas and groceries for the month as we approach the traditional retirement age we are slowly paying off our daughter loan and trying to keep our heads above water please dont use my name i live in a small town and this is so embarrassing
4693029 i am so frightened i spent this winter with my heat turned down to 53 degrees i am a teacher and have my masters degree everything is going up except my salary which next year will go up slightly above 1 percent the middle class is no longer the middle class ive slipped into the lower class after a winter of double heating costs and now these new economic hits
4693030 my husband and i followed all the rules he grew up in urban projects and went into the and go to college i grew up picking strawberries as a migrant worker but i was able to go to college on scholarships it doesnt seem right that after working hard and following all the rules for our lives now at 60 were tumbling down
4693031 i am thankful that my employer understands that many of us cannot afford to drive to work five days a week instead i work three 15 hour days keeping the heat at home just high enough to keep the pipes from bursting the bedrooms are not heated and stay at 30 degrees and i still cant keep up
4693032 we eat cereal and toast for dinner some nights because that is all i have
4693033 my parents both in their 60s are back to work so they can make ends meet and struggle to get enough gas money to see their doctors they are opting to close their house up for the winter and stay with my uncle so they dont have to put oil in the furnace meanwhile my mortgage is behind and we are at risk for foreclosure

4693036 if the country is a third democratic a third republican and a third independent a democratic president who appoints only democrats has eliminated two thirds of the public from consideration
4693037 that rare combination of humility and confidence required to perform wisely at the highest level
4693038 the world has changed fundamentally and our system has not been able to adapt to these changes
4693039 the kind of reaching across the aisle that all of us believe is necessary

4693051 our staff did a great job without him but this is how weve built our team with him on the sideline
4693052 the whole idea was lets be so unbelievably diversified that we wont be affected but when the credit markets seize up no matter what kind of financial company you are everything seizes up
4693053 the ubs statement basically shows the model is a failure
4693054 concept behind the creation of jpmorgan chase has broken down
4693055 no steel company can sell steel when auto manufacturers arent selling cars and no bank can make big profits when theres a weakness in the housing and credit markets
4693056 they have to ride out the cycle minimize the losses and maximize profits when the cycle returns you cant restructure a company to avoid that cycle
4693057 lars was in a good mood this morning he bought me coffee

4693059 i wonder how some of these people turn their pcs on
4693060 i did not know that this song would receive this much attention and i am known to the fact that the wonder girls are the first girl group to receive an award on the day of their comeback
4693061 i had to take my goggles off first to make sure the one was next to my name
4693062 im in sort of a dream world sometimes you have to pinch yourself to see if it is real
4693063 its the smallest margin of victory in our sport it was pretty cool
4693064 i was starting to hurt for the last 10 meters it was my last individual race and i just wanted to finish as strong as i could

4693080 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4693081 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4693082 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4693083 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4693084 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4693096 i just knew he was always there like an old brown shoe you wear day after day you walk through the mud and its still comfortable
4693097 sometimes you want red sassy pumps but its the brown shoes you put on at the end of the day
4693098 with our kids we wanted them to finish high school
4693099 theres a few times hed take me out on the motorcycle i felt so comfortable and safe with him
4693100 seeing him cheering at every game was a big thing for me
4693101 we had always been us and now its me he was my best friend husband and father of our children he was my mechanic handyman cook yard guy carpenter and love of my life
4693102 i remember meeting him the first day of second grade having the biggest crush on him in sixth grade and finally asking him out on a date two weeks before we graduated
4693103 we have been together ever since and know that his presence will continue to be with me

4693111 theres something stately about these treasures that actually show their history once regal vehicles that have been left unrestored by their owners
4693112 some have sat untouched for decades in barns under tarps or buried in the back of deserted warehouses while others have been lovingly driven around town in each instance theyre unique beautiful and bear witness to the passage of time not only to those who created them but to those who drove them
4693113 i couldnt find the car id been dreaming of so i decided to build it myself
4693114 once you get to an area thats all rocks you are there
4693115 a life spent making mistakes is not only more honorable but more useful than a life spent in doing nothing
4693116 i cannot give you the formula for success but i can give you the formula for failure which is try to please everybody

4693126 it makes me train harder when i get to the track no matter if im feeling good or feeling tired i have to work as hard as i can because i know that lashawn is doing the same thing
4693127 the last couple of races were great i ran two 43 second races and in stockholm ran 44 training has been going well probably the best of the season i feel as hard as ive worked ive got a chance to get the world record
4693128 i know it sounds close but thats about five meters on the track
4693129 but as long as i keep training the way i have and i stay focused and motivated its there its right there for me
4693130 to me the greatest part of breaking the world record was in pushing myself in order to get the achievement
4693131 i reached my goal and nobody will ever be able to take away that moment that i felt or the feat that i achieved
4693132 but thats a part of my life thats over now i dont consider myself still a track and field athlete im not the world record holder or the fastest man in the world well maybe i am still that
4693133 some people dont have any goals after they finish they wake up every day and say hey im the world record holder and that makes me feel good about myself that is not what makes me feel good about myself this is what i do
4693134 coach hart 73 is getting older and i know hes probably thinking about a time to retire i thought now would be the best time to make the change coach ford trained under coach hart when he went to baylor and hes been coaching with coach hart for eight years now his set of philosophies is the same as coach harts my workouts are the same everything on the track is exactly the same
4693135 ive been there before and i know when it takes to run the rounds back to back
4693136 losing those races doesnt do anything to me actually it helps me out knowing that people can beat me at any time ive got to train harder and work harder
4693137 im not going to make any excuses a loss is a loss but one thing michael johnson told me is that when im running at my best and im running in the 43s hes gonna have to run a personal record merritts is 43 96 to beat me my goal for the summer is to defend my olympic gold medal and nothing has changed to make me think that wont happen
4693138 im just me and i never thought about any of those things
4693139 i honestly never considered my race when i started out racing i just figured that if youre good at something and work hard at it you can be the best
4693140 as far as michael is concerned its great being compared to a great athlete like him but i know that im going to have to do better than hes done to be on top i need to break his world record and win more titles and do things that he never did
4693141 if i stay on top of my body make sure i get treatment when i need it and stay healthy and dont get injured i would love to go through 2016
4693142 hopefully chicago gets the olympics and i would love to end my career there at an american olympics
4693143 michael was 31 when he broke the world record id be 32 in 2016 and im gonna know when its time to retire there are some athletes out there who are still trying to run when they know theyre not as good as they once were i dont want to be one of those when its time for me to stop ill stop

4693156 it was more than i expected but i should have expected big and beautiful things out of boise idaho because thats what always happens in this community
4693157 everyone comes together and the community has proved that time and time again i couldnt have done it without everyones support
4693158 i think its great for my children to have someone local and someone that theyve met and seen to be a good role model for them to follow
4693159 i hadnt ever touched a gold medal until i won the gold medal
4693160 i hope that this has really been an inspiration for kids and i hope i can be a role model for years to come

4693163 about 75 percent of the class will say yes theyve been bitten
4693164 most of the time its a family dog or a friends or neighbors
4693165 there have been some horribly disfiguring bites to the face
4693166 even the sweetest most docile animal will instinctively or reactionarily snap out or bite
4693167 maybe we have a higher population of pit bulls than other dogs
4693168 the ankle biters are the ones who have left all the scars on my hands
4693169 ive never been bitten by a pit bull or large breed dog
4693170 it sounds funny until youve got five dogs biting you
4693171 about 75 percent of the class will say yes theyve been bitten
4693172 most of the time its a family dog or a friends or neighbors
4693173 there have been some horribly disfiguring bites to the face

4693175 maybe we have a higher population of pit bulls than other dogs
4693176 the number of people involved in crashes was about the same
4693177 the number of serious nonfatal injuries actually went down and moderate injuries were almost the same
4693178 i dont think there was any less of an enforcement effort last year and the media safety campaigns i dont think have changed
4693179 for the years on either side of those the numbers come back to the norms

4693189 its tough on us because hes our senior guy hes the most experienced receiver we have coming back
4693190 i was expecting he would go for a world record time but it is a real honor to be swimming with michael phelps
4693191 it was great that all eyes were on me and looking at the guy who could beat michael phelps its a pity we didnt both finish at 50 58 i would have loved to share that gold
4693192 beforehand coach bob bowman said it would be good for me if i lost
4693193 wen he said that i was fired up i said im going to go for it
4693194 i came wanting to win as many races as i could getting as many personal bests i could
4693195 i have seven out of seven so far i dont know what to say
4693196 it is very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4693197 it is very clear that one was stroking and one was gliding
4693198 its great to win a medal i cant take it off im not angry
4693199 it was just a great race to be a part of just a spectacle
4693200 i was expecting he would go for a world record time but it is a real honor to be swimming with michael phelps
4693201 it was great that all eyes were on me and looking at the guy who could beat michael phelps its a pity we didnt both finish at 50 58 i would have loved to share that gold
4693202 beforehand coach bob bowman said it would be good for me if i lost

4693208 its great to win a medal i cant take it off im not angry
4693209 it was just a great race to be a part of just a spectacle
4693210 with some of this sharp price collapse in commodities you would think the market would be up a lot more
4693211 the underlying factor is that credit continues to appear to be very weak
4693212 i was shocked at the end it was kind of a little bit of a delayed reaction
4693213 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i had lost the race right there but i guess that was the difference in the end
4693214 i was starting to hurt for the last 10 metres it was my last individual race and i just wanted to finish as strong as i could
4693215 he cavic said it would be good for the sport of swimming and good for me if i lost thats what he was quoted as so when bob told me that i was pretty fired up
4693216 when someone does say something it makes me more excited and more ready to go so i guess i thank him for that
4693217 its not over yet i really do think australias going to have a great relay tomorrow and its going to be a race and im looking forward to it
4693218 it was the type of thing i was dreaming about last night i knew i could be up there fishing for a medal and it is just amazing
4693219 words cannot comprehend how i am feeling at the moment
4693220 it was just a great race to be part of an absolute spectacle
4693221 try to see if i can get some bigwigs from back here to go up there and say look you just gotta make up your mind you gotta get this done
4693222 the more liberal camp just assumes that pastor warren is going to make this a christian litmus test of the presidency others who are more conservative fear he is going to wimp out on some of the issues

4693224 this is a pretty standard way to do tax reforms in social security
4693225 if we kept the payroll tax exactly the same but applied it to all earnings and not just the first 97 500 we could virtually eliminate the entire social security shortfall
4693226 the thing about a doughnut hole is that it is empty
4693227 there is nothing and that it seems is what is left of barack obamas plan to fix social security
4693228 make no mistake what obama is really saying is that at least for the campaign he is walking away from social security and all of its problems
4693229 barack obama said he wants to protect middle class families in terms of the taxes they pay in and the benefits they get
4693230 certainly would not go above what existed under bill clinton which was 28 percent
4693231 my guess would be it would be significantly lower than that
4693232 i would look at raising the capital gains tax for purposes of fairness

4693259 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4693260 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4693261 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4693262 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4693263 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4693264 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades

4693287 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar

4693290 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
4693291 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
4693292 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4693293 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
4693294 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4693295 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4693296 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4693297 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
4693298 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
4693299 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
4693300 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4693301 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4693302 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4693303 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4693304 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4693305 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4693306 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
4693307 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4693308 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
4693309 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables

4693319 thats whats so amazing to me you can start with just a little bit and it starts working for you
4693320 businesses are just kind of corrupted to hide behind brands or to be anonymous
4693321 if you think about what the social media phenomena is telling us its i want to deal with people

4693389 i found him to be very straightforward and trustworthy we had a very good dialogue i was able to get a sense of his soul
4693390 roosevelt felt this way about stalin who he called uncle joe
4693391 clinton had this feeling about yeltsin reagan felt this way with gorbachev they all felt that they had a special relationship with the soviet and russian leaders but when it comes to defining national interests the personal relationship is not very important
4693392 he was one of the last holdouts in his administration as russian policies began to harden
4693393 every step of the way the worst case scenario had happened
4693394 we wanted to establish to the jury what marys motives were
4693395 this wasnt simply a trespassing case but the judge took away marys defense
4693396 in most first amendment cases someone violates a local law whether its disturbing the peace trespassing or inciting a riot
4693397 i cannot in good conscience give my money to a system that doesnt provide justice
4693398 in a round about way the judge did me a favor

4693404 he was quite young but he already had a good sense of the event
4693405 he knew all the big jumpers of the time he was very familiar with careers of charles johnson hollis conway dwight stones even and i think that was a big advantage for him he seemed to study the event he had the athletic ability but he also had the brains more than anybody else i coached at that level
4693406 ive never encountered such a divisive issue as this one
4693407 it was really trying to figure out trying to solve this problem once and for all
4693408 immigration is such a polarizing and divisive issue for people we have allowed this issue to overtake the fundamental belief in education for everybody
4693409 when i did take that extra half stroke i thought that had lost the race
4693410 but i guess when i took that half stroke that was what i needed
4693411 my goal in this race was a bronze and i surpassed that with a silver i can say i was the only guy at this competition to have a real shot at beating phelps one on one
4693412 i had to take off my goggles first to make sure the 1 was next to my name
4693413 thats when i sort of let out my roar i felt relief excitement everything
4693414 hes one of those rare guys who can win by huge gaps and he can win really close races too
4693415 all these issues were pointing out could be universally acceptable and useful for everybody
4693416 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4693417 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4693418 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4693419 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4693420 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4693421 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4693422 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4693423 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4693424 hes under usoc care im going to visit him tomorrow
4693425 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4693426 als die bundesregierung in washington damit begann schulen zu schusswaffenfreien zonen zu machen haben doch all diese schie ereien wie das massaker in columbine 1999 angefangen
4693427 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4693428 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4693429 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4693430 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4693431 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4693432 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4693433 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4693434 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4693435 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4693436 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4693437 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4693438 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4693439 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4693440 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4693441 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4693442 a lookout should be built in green colorbond steel a lookout in the same style as the magnificent grand canyon lookout

4693444 the lamington plateau remains one of australias seven most superb natural wonders
4693445 there is some urgent need for lateral thinking with the lookout sites
4693446 if it could be done at a reasonable cost out of glass then all the better otherwise green colorbond to match the landscape

4693449 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4693450 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4693451 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4693452 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4693453 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4693454 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4693455 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4693456 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4693457 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4693458 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4693459 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4693460 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4693461 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4693462 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4693463 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4693464 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4693465 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

4693469 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4693470 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4693471 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4693472 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

4693477 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4693478 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4693479 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4693480 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4693481 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4693482 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4693483 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4693484 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4693485 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4693486 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4693487 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4693488 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4693489 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

4693491 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4693492 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4693493 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4693494 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4693495 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

4693521 theres nothing wrong with speculating about the future as long as you have established a specific path from the present and therefore have defined likely courses of action thats the line between futurism and science fiction you are using the trends of the present to anticipate possible paths into the future paths which can become plans of action or intervention what bothers me about speculation on the singularity are the presumptions of inevitability and imminence without any defined paths from the present and thus no proposed course of action so like the rapture it has to be perpetually imminent to have any meaning since theres nothing the average person can do about it beyond guessing on investment in the right stock waiting in hopeful anticipation or attempting to will it into existence through some sort of communal form of neurolinguistic programming such a shallow focus on the idealized end result and the most advanced end forms of technology can actually be detrimental to the goal of its realization because exaggerated expectations cause people to ignore or overlook the necessary near term developments that need their support and participation the more we focus exclusively on the post singularity the longer singularity will take to accomplish because technology does not spontaneously advance by itself this has been one of the key problems with space advocacy many nasa people curse star trek and science fiction in general for creating unrealistic expectations in an american population with a poor science education and a poor grasp of the line between reality and fantasy thus making it that much harder for them to make a case for the relevance of whats possible to do today not that nasa itself is entirely blameless in this itself mind you too much science fiction is just fantasy with machines because a lot of writers just dont care about scientific plausibility or realistic visions of the future like the rest of the culture it abandoned the actual future a long time ago but the association with science compels many to assume it must be more than mere fantasy so far too many people expect the starship enterprise and see anything less than that to be pointless folly or even part of some conspiracy of technology suppression certainly nasa may not be the most efficient at space development their priorities in research are often irrational because of politics and aerospace industry nepotism but they actually routinely get accused of conspiring to keep the warp drives flying saucers and antigravity under wraps for the exclusive use of some secrete elite ive encountered this kind of problem frequently with tmp its very hard to relate in relevance the necessary lower tech long period activities one must do now to goals as lofty as wholesale solar system settlement its hard to get people to comprehend how starting a media production company doing real estate development or engaging in open source artifact development has any relevance to getting to space and when reality cant meet expectations particularly the expectation of personally living in space in their lifetime many people have no compulsion in adopting psuedo scientific nonsense as a short cut now its not fair to generalize here a lot of people in the transhumanism community are indeed trying to define a specific path into the future especially those who have a real grasp of actual science and technology but there are others who because they have no means to actually participate in advanced technology development in any practical way and have only a rudimentary understanding of it just engage in that game of speculative fantasy for its own sake still id rather see people thinking and talking about a positive future in any fashion than wallowing in the compulsive nostalgia fantasy cultural narcissism and dystopianism that has marked the popular culture in the west for the past half a century

4693559 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
4693560 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
4693561 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit

4693593 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4693594 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i lost the race there but i guess that was the difference in the race
4693595 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths

4693718 the massive horizon blue cross blue shield of new jersey health insurer today formally applied to become a for profit company a move the insurers executives say will generate 1 billion for insurance assistance in new jersey blue cross blue shield which covers 3 6 million new jerseyans is seeking permission to convert to for profit status under terms of a 2001 state law that authorized such transactions william j marino the companys presient and ceo said the conversion will not affect premiums our board of directors has decided to reconsider conversion at this time because our nations health care system is undergoing a rapid transformation marino said in a statement announcing the application as the states oldest and largest health insurer we have an obligation to our more than 3 6 million members to be prepared to meet their needs as our health care system changes under terms of the state conversion law 100 percent of the proceeds of the blue cross conversion would have to be dedicated to expanding access to affordable health care marino said in his statement marino said blue cross blue shield would enjoy a greater ability to borrow funds and invest in new technology as a private entity the company has operated as a not for profit insurer for more than 75 years

4693721 there has been much in the press about beijings bad outdoor air pollution problems
4693722 but in reality the average person spends 90 of their time indoors it is indoor air that most affects our health while we cant do much about outdoor air we can take control of our indoor environments and make them healthy that is what we have done here with clean air apartment we have taken a normal apartment in the worlds most polluted city and turned it into one of the healthiest indoor environment that can be found anywhere in the world
4693723 we had to keep our project with athletes top secret for more than a year but now that the games have begun we can finally talk about it in all of the excitement of the competitions and people winning medals we didnt want to lose focus that what we are really about is creating healthy homes there are hundreds of millions of people around the world with severe allergies asthma other respiratory conditions and environmental sensitivities we are introducing to the world an innovative new kind of air cleaning technology that comprehensively removes indoor airborne irritants like dust mold pollen diesel soot allergens even bacteria and viruses at a level never before previously possible in homes clean air apartment gives us the opportunity to show people that this technology isnt just for helping athletes win medals its for improving your health and your families health in your home
4693724 we are data logging outdoor and indoor levels of airborne particles in terms of pm 10 pm 2 5 and pc 0 3
4693725 most of the government agencies have been reporting pm 10 levels in beijing but we think that is outdated pm 2 5 is a better and pc 0 3 is the best base measure of particulate air pollution most particles in pm 10 are relatively large particles so to speak sort of the rocks in the air but it is the submicron particles that are actually most dangerous to people these ultra fine particles are capable of penetrating lung tissue and entering the blood stream
4693726 when you consider that most air purifiers that people purchase at department stores improve you air quality by less than 5 in your home
4693727 we were very happy when we approached the 90 purity mark but then as the systems continued to clean already filtered air we rapidly saw the numbers go up a percentage point or two each day when we consistently reached 95 we were honestly able to say that we have better air here in our apartment in beijing than you have in the swiss alps
4693728 weve done many things over the last few years to try to demonstrate and educate people about what is really possible with good air cleaning
4693729 there are a lot of families out there with children with severe allergies and asthma and we are trying to raise awareness about an innovative new technology that can genuinely improve peoples lives

4694037 but lets be clear these issues equal pay work family balance childcare these are by no means just womens issues when a job doesnt offer family leave that also hurts men who want to help care for a new baby or an ailing parent when theres no affordable childcare or afterschool programs that hurts children who wind up in second rate care or spending afternoons alone in front of the tv when women still make just 77 cents for every dollar men make black and latina women even less that doesnt just hurt women it hurts families who find themselves with less income and have to work even harder just to get by so youd think solving these problems would be one of our highest national priorities but while some politicians in washington make a lot of noise about family values when it comes to what people actually need to support their families and care for their families and spend time with their families they get awfully quiet dont they and year after year it just gets harder for working parents especially working women to make a living while raising their kids we take it for granted that women are the backbone of our families but we too often ignore the fact that women are also the backbone of our middle class and we wont truly have an economy that puts the needs of the middle class first until we ensure that when it comes to pay and benefits at work women are treated like the equal partners they are

4694086 west australians have a very good sense of fair play
4694087 and i would hope that would receive the approval of all sides of politics and that governments will be obligated to serve out their four years not run for cover as alan carpenter has done six months before the election
4694088 what weve discovered in this election is a government which has completely trashed the convention completely trashed the traditions
4694089 and we now believe it is necessary to bring in a law which requires parliament to go their four years
4694090 however governments will have to choose a date in february or march thereby giving the community considerably more certainty that currently exists
4694091 if thats their approach then thats good because it means theyve come around to the labor partys decision
4694092 every now and then they do support what were doing and if theyre going to support what wed like to do thats good

4694329 we obviously played a long game yesterday and knowing weve got a day game tomorrow we didnt need to play those extra innings
4694330 carrasco actually threw me all sliders up until a fastball that was up and in that was the only fastball i saw the whole count except for that last pitch

4694345 its important for people to know that he williams and toulon contacted us
4694346 we havent gone chasing any of this we were prepared to take the matter to court and make him accountable and still are if an agreement is not reached
4694347 a financial settlement is going to be found at the beginning of next week
4694348 the fact he has decided not to defy the injunction sends a clear message to people who want to break their contract
4694349 how long he stays on the sidelines is one of the issues that has been raised
4694350 ive said on a few occasions that the issue is that not only does his departure impact on us on the field but also off the field
4694351 an impact across the whole business current and future players supporters sponsors we need to take all that into account on the next range of discussions with toulon

4694396 the question is not can they reason nor can they talk but can they suffer
4694397 perhaps condit had been indirectly involved that he knew the reason why levy had been killed that he had arranged to have her murdered
4694398 i dont think condit killed her i think he could have known it was going to happen
4694399 i think condit knows more than what did happen than he has ever said
4694400 reasonable viewers would understand that dunnes summary of the story was merely in response to costass own summary of dunnes prior statements
4694401 gary condit i did not name in connection with that
4694402 i think condit knows more than what did happen than he has ever said
4694403 could have known it presumably levys murder was going to happen
4694404 mainstream tv still has a grip on first run series but audiences are increasingly going to the internet to get videos films and tv episodes including the morass of stuff they find on youtube

4694417 shamelessly capitulated and agreed that the new york trial could go first
4694418 the jurors eagerly met with the press to criticize the prosecution and proclaimed that altman was unquestionably innocent
4694419 i told them that the story line an icons fall from grace was too good and caused them to get carried away and accept at face value all that was told to them by out of control prosecutors
4694420 the best reason why the independent counsel law should never be brought back to life is lawrence walsh walshs prosecution of weinberger was one of the greatest abuses of prosecutorial power i have ever encountered
4694421 would cooperate by providing evidence against president reagan and other high level officials of his administration they would accept a misdemeanor plea and would support a recommendation of no jail
4694422 innocent of all the charges made against him and i believe he would have been fully vindicated at trial
4694423 his indictment was a gross miscarriage of justice perpetuated by an irresponsible prosecutor
4694424 while the constitution diffuses power the better to secure liberty it also contemplates that practice will integrate the dispersed powers into a workable government it enjoins upon its branches separateness but interdependence autonomy but reciprocity presidential powers are not fixed but fluctuate depending upon their disjunction or conjunction with those of congress
4694425 over a period of a century and a half thirteen presidents found a total of twenty occasions on which to refuse to turn over information demanded by an arm of congress if one looks at what was done and confines the words to the events nothing appears whicheven approaches a solid historical practice of recognizing claims of executive privilege based upon an undifferentiated need forpreservingthe secrecy of internal communications within the executive branch
4694426 can almost always be properly conducted with reference to information concerning decisions which the executive branch has already reached

4694483 one hour after they drank red bull their blood systems were no longer normal they were abnormal like we would expect in a patient with cardiovascular disease
4694484 the study does not show effects which would go beyond that of drinking a cup of coffee therefore the reported results were to be expected and lie within the normal physiological range

4694496 the immunity provisions would not apply to the government or government officials cases against the government regarding the alleged programs would continue and the provisions would apply only to civil and not criminal cases
4694497 the framework contained in the bill for obtaining retroactive liability protection is narrowly tailored the liability protection provision does not extend to the government or to government officials and it does not immunize any criminal conduct
4694498 would aggressively go after and investigate whether crimes have been committed

4694507 van de 229 inbraken in onze zone waren er slechts 33 slachtoffers die een adviseur wensten voor anti inbraaktips dat is dus nog geen 15 procent
4694508 in vier jaar tijd ben ik op vier plaatsen geweest we proberen de tips zo eenvoudig en zo goedkoop mogelijk te houden maar dan nog is het voor veel mensen te veel
4694509 tellen we daarbij het advies na een inbraak dan komen we wel op 41 bezochte plaatsen
4694510 wij geven ook tips die geen geld kosten leg bijvoorbeeld in de rail van de garagepoort een houten lat een dief wil zo snel mogelijk binnen zijn maak hem dat zo moeilijk mogelijk
4694511 onze politiemensen geven bij de vaststelling van een inbraak de eerste tips daarna kan men nog een adviseur vragen

4694514 a civil union partnership contract or other arrangement between persons of the same sex purporting to bestow the privileges or obligations of marriage is prohibited any such civil union partnership contract or other arrangement entered into by persons of the same sex in another state or jurisdiction shall be void in all respects in virginia and any contractual rights created thereby shall be void and unenforceable
4694515 there have been two appeals in the same case between the same parties and the facts are the same nothing decided on the first appeal can be re examined on a second appeal right or wrong it is binding on both the trial court and the appellate court and is not subject to re examination by either for the purpose of that case though only for that case the decision on the first appeal is the law
4694516 a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed
4694517 undoubtedly some think that the second amendment is outmoded in a society where our standing army is the pride of our nation where well trained police forces provide personal security and where gun violence is a serious problem
4694518 that is perhaps debatable but what is not debatable is that it is not the role of this court to pronounce the second amendment extinct
4694519 the purging of ill humours being necessary to the health of the human body the right of the people to be bled by physicians shall not be infringed
4694520 the districts ban on handgun possession in the home violates the second amendment as does its prohibition against rendering any lawful firearm in the home operable for the purpose of immediate self defense
4694521 would be tolerable if necessary to preserve a time honored legal principle vital to our constitutional republic
4694522 thus just as this court recognized in perez that it was not constitutionally permissible to continue to treat racial or ethnic minorities as inferior we now similarly recognize that an individuals homosexual orientation is not a constitutionally legitimate basis for withholding or restricting the individuals legal rights
4694523 full implementation of desegregation may require solution of varied local school problems
4694524 the vitality of constitutional principles cannot be allowed to yield simply because of disagreement with them
4694525 s tate officials attempted to obstruct desegregation in every imaginable way
4694526 t here has been entirely too much deliberation and not enough speed
4694527 nonracial grounds might support a states allowing a county to abandon public schools the object must be a constitutional one and grounds of race and opposition to desegregation do not qualify as constitutional
4694528 what did punitive damages do why misunderstanding the history of punitive damages matters today
4694529 the allegations made by mcclellan that karl rove scooter libby and possibly even vice president dick cheney together conspired to obstruct justice by lying about their role in the plame case relates directly to the core of us executive power and the constitution if true the allegations made by mcclellan could amount to an obstruction of justice charge for scooter libby and karl rove
4694530 what i would want to do is to have my justice department and my attorney general immediately review the information thats already there and to find out are there inquiries that need to be pursued i cant prejudge that because we dont have access to all the material right now i think that you are right if crimes have been committed they should be investigated youre also right that i would not want my first term consumed by what was perceived on the part of republicans as a partisan witch hunt because i think weve got too many problems weve got to solve
4694531 so this is an area where i would want to exercise judgment i would want to find out directly from my attorney general having pursued having looked at whats out there right now are there possibilities of genuine crimes as opposed to really bad policies and i think its important one of the things weve got to figure out in our political culture generally is distinguishing between really dumb policies and policies that rise to the level of criminal activity you know i often get questions about impeachment at town hall meetings and ive said that is not something i think would be fruitful to pursue because i think that impeachment is something that should be reserved for exceptional circumstances now if i found out that there were high officials who knowingly consciously broke existing laws engaged in cover ups of those crimes with knowledge forefront then i think a basic principle of our constitution is nobody is above the law and i think thats roughly how i would look at it
4694532 you are entitled to your opinion but youre not entitled to your own facts
4694533 code prohibits interference with an investigation and a person who relocates a residence or conceals a child with the intent to interfere with an investigation commits an offense

4694537 i said to him that if we come up short and there are some acquittals in our cases it will at least validate the process

4694547 de bewuste wijk is ingekleurd als industriezone en niet als woongebied wat natuurlijk in het nadeel van de bewoners heeft gespeeld het is een moeilijk verhaal als stad hebben we interesse voor ontwikkelingskansen maar we hebben absoluut geen druk uitgeoefend op het bedrijf in de eerste plaats was dit een dossier tussen huurder en verhuurder maar de mensen die er wonen zijn zeer gehecht aan de site een gemeenschap die nu uit elkaar valt

4694602 o nly marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized
4694603 california constitutional law does not embrace the view that minority rights turn on the majoritys willingness to recognize those rights

4694610 i know there wasnt but suppose there was a common law rule that said in cases involving witches you cannot admit any evidence because either the witch the accused witch came up out of the water when they were dunking her and therefore she is guilty so there is no need or she is under water which shows she is you know not guilty but you cant cross examine a person under water now if there were a rule like that would we now incorporate it into the constitution of the united states
4694611 full faith and credit to the public acts records and judicial proceedings

4694614 the care and education of children in a stable environment
4694615 the most socially productive and individually fulfilling relationship that one can enjoy in the course of a lifetime
4694616 the institution of civil marriage affords official governmental sanction and sanctuary to the family unit
4694617 simply confirms that a stable two parent family relationship supported by the states official recognition and protection is equally as important for the numerous children in california who are being raised by same sex couples as for those being raised by opposite sex couples

4694622 if you are nominated for president in 2008 and your major opponents agree to forgo private funding in the general election campaign will you participate in the presidential public financing system
4694623 yes in february 2007 i proposed a novel way to preserve the strength of the public financing system in the 2008 election my plan requires both major party candidates to agree on a fundraising truce return excess money from donors and stay within the public financing system for the general election my proposal followed announcements by some presidential candidates that they would forgo public financing so they could raise unlimited funds in the general election the federal election commission ruled the proposal legal and senator john mccain r az has already pledged to accept this fundraising pledge if i am the democratic nominee i will aggressively pursue an agreement with the republican nominee to preserve a publicly financed general election
4694624 the candidates will have to commit to discouraging cheating by their supporters to refusing fundraising help to outside groups and to limiting their own parties to legal forms of involvement and the agreement may have to address the amounts that senator mccain the presumptive nominee of his party will spend for the general election while the democratic primary contest continues

4694631 weve got to spend time in the shadows in the intelligence world
4694632 a lot of what needs to be done here will have to be done quietly without any discussion using sources and methods that are available to our intelligence agencies if were going to be successful thats the world these folks operate in and so its going to be vital for us to use any means at our disposal basically to achieve our objective
4694633 the cable is a black electrical cable about two inches thick
4694634 any act by which severe pain or suffering whether physical or mental is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession
4694635 inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity

4694637 rendition of suspects without any judicial procedure to states where they face a real risk of torture
4694638 cease the rendition of suspects in particular by its intelligence agencies to states where they face a real risk of torture
4694639 procurement of diplomatic assurances which moreover provided no mechanism for their enforcement did not suffice to protect against this manifest risk

4694641 may not enact or enforce a law regulation or other provision related to a price route or service of an air carrier
4694642 clearly foresaw the possibility of challenges to the legislation on preemption grounds
4694643 while federal law places restrictions on what individual states can do when it comes to legislation relating to air travel federal courts have held that the provision of amenities for air travelers is one area that states can legitimately address
4694644 congress intended to preempt only state laws that would adversely affect the economic deregulation of the airlines and the forces of competition within the airline industry accordingly we hold that congress used the word service in the phrase rates routes or service in the adas preemption clause to refer to the prices schedules origins and destinations of the point to point transportation of passengers cargo or mail in the context in which it was used in the act service was not intended to include an airlines provision of in flight beverages personal assistance to passengers the handling of luggage and similar amenities
4694645 o n board amenities regardless of whether they are luxuries or necessities still relate to airline service and fall within the express terms of the adas preemption provision

4694648 in the mold of barry goldwater a principled conservative not a kleptocratic opportunist
4694649 mccain has spent much time puzzling over goldwaters lack of embrace
4694650 i admired him to the point of reverence and i wanted him to like me he was usually cordial just never as affectionate as i would have liked
4694651 t he biggest differences between mccain and goldwater were so obvious and so destined to keep the two men out of each others arms that mccains inability to identify them borders on self denial and political tone deafness
4694652 poses an untoward readily avoidable risk of inflicting severe and unnecessary pain
4694653 why if the use of pancuronium bromide is undesirable would those in the netherlands interested in practices designed to bring about a humane death recommend the use of that or similar drugs
4694654 has an interest in preserving the dignity of the procedure especially where convulsions or seizures could be misperceived as signs of consciousness or distress
4694655 whatever minimal interest there may be in ensuring that a condemned inmate dies a dignified death and that witnesses to the execution are not made uncomfortable by an incorrect belief which could easily be corrected that the inmate is in pain is vastly outweighed by the risk that the inmate is actually experiencing excruciating pain that no one can detect
4694656 justice powell wrote separately and i thought he left open the circumstance of an outrageous rape resulting in serious lasting harm to the victim so you dont have an opinion of five justices saying that in any and all circumstances rape that leaves the victim alive cannot be punished by the death penalty
4694657 thats sic strange way of making a majority isnt it
4694658 i think you have to discount the people who would not allow the death penalty under any circumstances for any crime
4694659 t he argument was made from an earlier tradition when a woman was regarded as as good as dead once she was raped and the crime was thought to be an offense against her husband or her father and that was the background of coker plus the racial element in it was very strong
4694660 the notion was that making rape equivalent to murder was no kindness to women because it said once youve been raped youre spoiled thats not theres no parallel with child rape
4694661 the reality that rape is inherently one of the most egregiously brutal acts one human being can inflict upon another
4694662 v olumes have been written by victims physicians and psychiatric specialists on the lasting injury suffered by rape victims
4694663 was the imposition of the death penalty for the crime of rape a form of cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the eighth amendment
4694664 life may not be nearly so happy as it was
4694665 i think its fair to say that societys recognition of the seriousness of the crime of rape has evolved even since the period since coker
4694666 i wonder if thats more something on which we have less basis for determining the issue than a legislature i dont know how we decide this for the reason you were just saying what crimes are more serious than others
4694667 i wonder if it brings into play our jurisprudence on things like the three strikes law and others where we sort of say we cant judge how serious crimes are and which ones are more serious than others and so we leave that to another branch

4694694 i have tried to give women what they say they want but they always want something else women think that what they want is for the man to really talk and to be at home with the kids but she doesnt want that for long she wants a strong man

4694724 from now on ive decided to be only an actor in a film theres no need to advise the director specially if he thinks he knows best

4694735 actress coleen dewhurst was a big fan she brought her producers in from new york to see the show they liked what they saw and i ended up going to new york to work with them
4694736 when she went to see a preview performance some months later she wouldnt talk to me for six months she said where is all that beautiful music i heard in canada it wasnt there gower champion had turned it into a rocknroll show his inspiration was a performance by yes keyboard player rick wakeman at madison square gardens
4694737 who was i to argue with gower champion a legend of broadway
4694738 everybody had thought it was going to be a hit
4694739 we talked about it further and decided to move ahead
4694740 then quite unexpectedly and accidentally producer barbara whitman who had produced spelling bee on broadway and legally blonde expressed an interest in my hamlet musical so the toronto producer and i upped the ante so to speak and decided to produce a much glorified concert version
4694741 it played to packed houses and got roaring standing ovations not common in toronto ive never been hugged so much in my life half from people i knew half from people i didnt know

4694748 physically its kind of like auto pilot you just go
4694749 you know that recent heroes who have done super human feats like this have always seemed to end up like marion jones barry bonds what do you say to the american people who say this is so good its too good to be true
4694750 i did project believe with usada the u s anti doping agency where i purposely wanted to do more tests to prove im clean people can question all they want the facts are the facts and i have the results to prove it
4694751 with a program like i have i have to work on speed and endurance and all four strokes
4694752 you cant do it on talent alone a lot of hard work a lot of dedication it has been a combination of everything trying to sleep as much as i can trying to recover set up every workout as well as i can and just try to bank a lot of workouts back to back
4694753 they can do any kind of test they want for me k you cant look someone in the eye and say i dont take drugs you have to take action
4694754 you know im kind of tired maybe i could do the dishes just when they pile up and start the dusting next month
4694755 giving up tv entirely would be a little ridiculous but if the big media companies can augment tv coverage with more detailed or more obscure coverage on the web thats a winning formula
4694756 im going to insert violent attack here with a insert obscure foreign object here in your odd body part here
4694757 our watch business is not at all threatened by cell phones
4694758 were the biggest vertu retailer in the country and vertu has a good chance to edge into our top 10 brands
4694759 they dont take a lot of space and a customer who will pay 5 000 for a phone wont hesitate to buy a high end high tech watch i dont expect people to collect phones the way they collect watches
4694760 watches were the no 1 request in our customer surveys
4694761 we added the watch boutique last thanksgiving and weve found that in a lot of ways watches are easier to sell than appliances no delivery no installation no dealing with wiring
4694762 but watches are more of a jewelry item especially for men since they cant collect shoes or handbags the way that a woman does
4694763 it took us a long time to get the highest end audio lines and itll be a similar process courting the manufacturers getting them into our store to show them that were a luxury store not an appliance dealer well have a watchmaker on premises by next year once weve sold about 5 000 watches we already offer basic services such as sizing and battery replacement
4694764 during the credit directed by alfred hitchcock alfred hitchcock is shown running after a bus which pulls away without him
4694765 the whole idea was lets be so unbelievably diversified that we wont be affected but when the credit markets seize up no matter what kind of financial company you are everything seizes up
4694766 the ubs statement basically shows the model is a failure
4694767 nest pas mort ce qui jamais dort et au long des si cles peut mourir m me la mort
4694768 the design of byxbee park is the result of a collaboration between the city of palo alto landscape architects hargreaves associates and artists michael oppenheimer and peter richards the project was funded in part by the city of palo alto refuse collection fees and the public art commissions art in public places program

4694770 when engaging publics its about figuring out which identities and values can be most relevant to supporting and working on an issue
4694771 they have a right to loudly broadcast their opinion but i have a similar right to offer my reservations and urge caution
4694772 scientists must adopt a language that emphasizes shared values and has broad appeal avoiding the pitfall of seeming to condescend to fellow citizens or alienating them by attacking their religious beliefs
4694773 scientists must adopt a language that emphasizes shared values and has broad appeal
4694774 the problem some of us have with the new atheists is not that theyre wrong its that theyre painfully boring on an intellectual level woefully uninspiring and plain old unlikable
4694775 scientists must adopt a language that emphasizes shared values and has broad appeal
4694776 these same people are having my arguments framed for them by their opinion leaders i e pz myers
4694777 anthropogenic global warming scientists atheists nasty mean people we are against anthropogenic global warming cant be true
4694778 recently groups like the ffrf american atheists codesh cfi aha sca and others have joined forces in america and are finally giving the old religious institutions that have kept america in the dark ages a run for their money
4694779 belief in democratic governance social progress economic prosperity and as kurtz notes in many cases freedom of personal choice tolerance
4694780 little old ladies and gentlemen in the suburbs conservative advertisers the catholic hierarchy or right wing fundamentalists
4694781 sagan really did challenge peoples religious beliefs he did it in a slightly less washpish way than dawkins does and
4694782 there was a loose confederation of egotistical elitists who decided to declare war on humanity
4694783 i never said he didnt offer praise for dawkins et al and obviously that is part of the transcript at my blog
4694784 paul kurtz in contrast to the new atheists we must emphasize shared values with the moderately religious
4694785 thats the exact same argument i have applied since the original publication of our science article
4694786 when dawkins et al attack moderately religious americans it alienates our natural allies and is a major self inflicted wound
4694787 3 and that these same people are having my arguments framed for them by their opinion leaders i e pz myers
4694788 i know what you are saying but i dont think a comparison to pz is a fair one
4694789 store all your baking items separately use baskets wire or wood to contain all your baking items everything you use to bake like your flour sugar vanilla baking soda and powder and getting them to the counter and back is a snap
4694790 he wants to write his own tunes instead of ruining everyone elses
4694791 mark ronson needs to learn three chords on the guitar and write a tune
4694792 the monkees havent split up theyre just going under the name of the kaiser chiefs
4694793 i did drugs for 18 years and i never got that bad as to say you know what i think the kaiser chiefs are brilliant
4694794 it was indeed fun directing rishton ki machine the script of the film and the performances by the star cast has been outstanding its a film which every family will be able to connect with and go home with a smile we are very confident of the film and the response that it will get and the curiosity it will generate amongst the audience
4694795 we keep reading about akshay kumars exploits at la how he performed various stunts how he met sylvester stallone etc but aftab has done the same stunts and also shared screen space with stallone he sees no reason to tom tom his work his logic being when the film is released everyone will know anyway whats the point of talking about it in fact aftab has withdrawn into a shell ever since he broke up with yana gupta he refused to talk about it even when he was offered front page coverage by papers that required guts when your career isnt going great guns and when his career didnt seem to be getting anywhere he quietly decided to produce a film and create an exciting opportunity for himself
4694796 ive been shooting for kambhakth ishq in la yeah i play akshay kumars sibling we both play stuntmen so it kinda runs in the family and its a family that kinda runs fast the role requires considerable physical skill and energy
4694797 the stunts are dangerous but everything is so professional here in hollywood safety while doing action scenes is top priority not just for the lead stars but also for the stunt men otherwise the experience of working at universal is no different from the studios back home
4694798 we should look at whether there is any possibility of revisiting the space shuttle extension even for short period of time while we are in the middle of this political and diplomatic and military nightmare
4694799 it is difficult to engage in a nation when you have a sizable amount of disagreements
4694800 instability and clear desire to wage war on democracies illustrates the need to increase nasas funding and close the gap
4694801 americas space program is best served by the talents of heroes at home not cosmonauts 5 000 miles away
4694802 could threaten our ability to make the maximum possible use
4694803 we are hopeful we can continue cooperation with the russians
4694804 but a lot of this depends on russia and what russias actions are in the near future
4694805 were optimistic things will work out in the long run
4694806 their failure to do so has put us in this regrettable situation
4694807 barring a major rupture in the u s russian relationship across the board
4694808 i do not see why space cooperation cannot be maintained
4694809 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4694810 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4694811 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4694812 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4694813 keep the community as informed as possible on different issues coming before the board
4694814 this is a fairly inexpensive way to get information out there
4694815 weve made real positive steps to have a transparent meeting
4694816 its another sign to the community that were earning your trust weve got nothing to hide here
4694817 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4694818 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4694819 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4694820 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4694821 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4694822 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4694823 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4694824 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4694825 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4694826 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4694827 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4694828 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4694829 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4694830 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4694831 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4694832 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4694833 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4694834 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4694835 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4694836 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4694837 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4694838 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4694839 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4694840 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4694841 this is a planning took where all things are going
4694842 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4694843 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4694844 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4694845 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4694846 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4694847 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4694848 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4694849 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4694850 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4694851 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4694852 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4694853 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4694854 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4694855 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4694856 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4694857 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4694858 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4694859 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4694860 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4694861 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4694862 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4694863 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4694864 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4694865 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4694866 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4694867 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4694868 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4694869 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4694870 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4694871 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4694872 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4694873 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4694874 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4694875 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4694876 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4694877 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4694878 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4694879 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4694880 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4694881 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4694882 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4694883 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4694884 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4694885 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4694886 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4694887 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4694888 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4694889 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4694890 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4694891 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4694892 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4694893 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4694894 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4694895 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4694896 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4694897 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4694898 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4694899 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4694900 pasitaiko pana i nesusipratim bet tai takos rezultatui finale tikrai netur s
4694901 if you drive it in the rough you are still going to struggle so its playing fair and the guys that are playing well are scoring i mean 9 under by carl is a great round but the pace might not stay that hot i think 20 under will end up winning it
4694902 they both have got games that they learned a long time ago and they havent tinkered with them
4694903 the pressure of following new swing theories never bothered them they both play solid golf and they both enjoy playing thats probably the biggest thing maybe their recreational activity might be golf
4694904 if you have given yourself a few more chances and still havent won thats ok its not something i think about too much but it will be nice when it does happen
4694905 it would be nice to do it here but ive got a lot work to do over the weekend
4694906 the long putter allowed him to practice a lot of putting without hurting
4694907 i told him were going to get a reputation if we dont watch out
4694908 im playing good and i just didnt make any putts today
4694909 i just have to work on that its nice to not make that many putts and still be 9 under
4694910 every guy that ran for president clear back to nixon said he would make us energy independent but not one blank thing has been done
4694911 the inadequate maintenance of power assets and the resulting low use of power generating capacity show how high the costs of supplying federal power are the government could reduce its production costs by performing more maintenance perhaps by diverting some funds from new construction the federal government spends significantly less than investor owned utilities and other publicly owned power systems on maintaining its generating and transmission facilities over the past 10 years the ratio of expenditures for maintenance to total revenues from power sales for investor owned utilities averaged nearly two thirds higher than that for federal utilities 7 2 percent versus 4 5 percent see figure 4 the average ratio over that period for publicly owned utilities was 6 8 percent that difference is not accounted for by the large number of hydropower facilities in the federal program even the tva which generates more than 80 percent of its power from coal nuclear energy and natural gas spends only about 5 percent of its revenues on maintenance indeed the disparity in maintenance costs per unit of power generated by federal and other utilities is even greater than those ratios suggest because federal agencies other than the tva generally sell electricity at a lower rate
4694912 government establishing and running companies just seems like a bad idea
4694913 thats not to say they shouldnt have oversight and influence over private power producers they should
4694914 i just fail to see how a business funded with tax dollars can be run as a
4694915 now you could argue the taxes are similar to capital investment but theres a key difference investors can choose whether or not to invest in a company as taxpayers we would have no say on whether to invest in this wec
4694916 sure you dont want individual income taxed but do you really think individuals wont feel the impact of taxes levied on other areas business taxes are a cost of doing business and are necessarily passed on to consumers therefore they are taxes on individuals
4694917 furthermore as i stated in my previous post based on available sources tracking the spending by existing energy companies to add wind power capacity i think you could help existing businesses reach the stated power production goals for about half your annual estimated budget for wec why spend double to achieve the same end result it makes no fiscal sense to me
4694918 although some of the ideas presented by your petition are not unprecedented tva comes to mind the feds track record in establishing companies to provide power generation has been mixed
4694919 the mightest serpant may be over come by a swarm of ants
4694920 its hard to say if its something well see replicated in other states
4694921 there is really no point in doing this on small scale
4694922 if youre going to make a difference youve got to do it big
4694923 look what i found i havent seen this for years
4694924 self she needs to be able to see this picture just as much as she has seen it in the past
4694925 lamore inizia in famiglia se non ci amiamo luno laltro nelle ventiquattro ore come potremo amare quelli che incontriamo solo occasionalmente
4694926 la peggiore malattia oggi non la lebbra ma essere esclusi essere dimenticati il peggiore flagello dimenticare colui che ci sta accanto essere soffocati per cos dire dalle cose non avere tempo per ges abbandonato magari in quella stessa persona della nostra famiglia che ha bisogno di noi
4694927 i didnt beat phelps but perhaps im the only guy at this competition who had a shot at beating phelps one on one
4694928 losing by a hundredth of a second is difficult its the hardest loss but its a complete miracle im here considering i was going to retire a year and a half ago
4694929 from my heart im enjoying it and i wish i had a gold medal but im happy with a silver
4694930 i had to help my people knowing it could be a big risk for my swimming career im proud of what i did
4694931 i had to do it to help the kosovo serbs knowing how hard it is for them there
4694932 cavic became an inspiration among serbs who object to losing kosovo an ethnic albanian dominated territory which many serbs consider the historic cradle of their nation kosovos independence has been recognized by the united states and most european union nations
4694933 there is a gold medal at stake but i came into this expecting bronze and i did one better and got silver and almost the gold
4694934 as they approached the finish with phelps head in line with cavics shoulder the serb took his final big stroke and glided underwater toward the gold
4694935 i knew that i was leading the race after the first 50 i usually do and i knew that michael is fast in the second 50 and he would be chasing me
4694936 priznam utrujen sem ker pa je lo za mojo zadnjo posami no preizku njo sem dal vse od sebe iztisnil sem iz sebe e zadnje atome mo i eprav sem pri obratu dvomil da mi bo uspelo
4694937 i could take my work to the library a couple nights a week if you stop locking me out when im just taking a shower
4694938 z delom in voljo je dosegla kar ni pred njo uspelo e nikomur
4694939 jasno ji je da mora delati e enkrat ve od tekmic e eli uspeh in lucija je to res delala

4694941 lahko jo spravim jok v treh minutah po drugi strani pa je zelo neprijetna e se ji kdo zameri
4694942 lucija nima prav nobenega strahu ima veliko srce in v mo ki konkurenci ne poznam tako neustra nega tekmovalca
4694943 te tekmovalke vsi podcenjujejo a neupravi eno imajo mo imajo kondicijo in treba za uspeh proti njim je treba garati pomembna je tudi taktika in lucija mora tukaj uporabiti ve jo hitrost spretnost in napadalnost tukaj gre za vrsto nakazanih akcij in odlo nost v pravem trenutku velika nevarnost pred katero jo vedno svarim pa je da se tem tekmovalkam ne pusti zgrabit okrog vratu takrat je borba zgubljena
4694944 na te i nikakor ne saj ne morem iz nje delati velikana bolj e bo e se bolj posvetiva tudi taktiki
4694945 pri nas vsi vidijo da je sistem druga en vlada trda disciplina pridite v telovadnico in videli boste da so na i natika i zlo eni na milimeter natan no ali pa si oglejte trening pred treningom gredo vsi na kolena in o istijo telovadnico

4694949 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4694950 mais infra estruturas que as necess rias para a nossa realidade
4694951 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4694952 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4694953 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4694954 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4694955 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4694956 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4694957 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4694958 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4694959 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4694960 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant

4694995 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4694996 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4695010 offensive tackles are the offensive linemen furthest away from the ball but defensive tackles are the ones closest to the ball on their line why is this
4695011 i read about something called the a11 offense in todays washington post its some crazy system that some california high schools are using with three down linemen two qbs and six receivers

4695033 my coach said before the race to fall asleep for a couple laps and then give it a go
4695034 i was just running so within myself trying to stay calm
4695035 i couldnt celebrate because i thought i might have been fourth
4695036 in my era it all started with deena kastor winning bronze in athens 2004 in the marathon

4695043 said although the womens march was organised as a protest against pass laws it was about the rights of women to participate in shaping a nation their right and freedom to participate as equals in the economic and social life of the country
4695044 challenged women to get involved in politics business and religious institutions to stand up and be counted to create a better future for the women of south africa
4695045 the women who marched in 1956 used their rights to fight apartheid as well as to create a better life for us as we look forward to 2010 let us make gender equality one of our main priorities

4695057 i dont get to watch some of the games because were always racing when theyre playing so whenever theres a caution flag out i ask my crew to tell me the score
4695058 these guys work a lot harder than i will on sunday
4695059 theyre out here sweating and hitting each other seven days a week
4695060 when youre going three wide at talledega at 200 miles an hour and youre an inch away from disaster i imagine thats pretty tough
4695061 my first time i did it i wrecked nascar sprint cup series driver denny hamlin
4695062 denny was really mad and cursing before dale jr told him to take it easy and explained who i was then i wound up wrecking him again and thats the last time ive ever raced against denny hamlin
4695063 i played pop warner football when i was a kid and i loved it
4695064 i was pretty good at it too i had an advantage because i did all my growing early so i was the biggest kid on my team
4695065 by the time i got to high school at southern regional though all the kids had passed me
4695066 dont be wearing that while youre driving your mustang because the cops will be looking for you
4695067 i cant tell you how excited i am to get the helmet and jersey theyre going right into my trophy case
4695068 we came out of the box really strong this season but we had a lot of bad stuff and bad luck happen to us
4695069 then we seemed to get our luck turned around but our performances didnt show it then we got hit with that penalty and that just killed us
4695070 you can look at how you run and the people youre with but that doesnt tell the whole story at the end of the day its all just part of racing
4695071 that part of the operation got more attention than the action itself
4695072 if any individual had done anything to the level of what the chinese government has done in tibet
4695073 in response to a legal request from hasbro the copyright and trademark holder for scrabble in the u s and canada the developers of scrabulous have suspended their application in the u s and canada until further notice
4695074 over the past year facebook has tried to use its status as neutral platform provider to help the parties come to an amicable agreement
4695075 were disappointed that hasbro has sought to draw us into their dispute nevertheless we have forwarded their concerns to scrabulous and requested their appropriate response
4695076 scrabulous is disabled for u s and canadian users until further notice
4695077 i didnt see the sidewalk and i twisted my ankle
4695078 it was a nice wake up call for me to be a lot more careful in the future because i clearly wasnt paying attention and i should have
4695079 theres a lot of things you shouldnt do this is another one on my list
4695080 i have to admit that i started a text while i was driving and then i said this is so stupid so i stopped
4695081 youre focusing on one task for a split second then focusing on another one and with something moving 40 miles an hour like a car it just takes a couple of seconds to be hit
4695082 we dont want to sound like some stern schoolmistress telling people dont text on your cell phone
4695083 with this team i dont think nervous is even a factor until you get a couple of outs in the seventh
4695084 i really felt that in the canada game we needed someone to come out there and throw zeros up until we could get the bats going
4695085 and the way cats been pitching i figured we could count on her to come through
4695086 i was ready to go if he needed me against japan and he changed things up at the last second which was fine we just have to all be ready at any point in time its all about matchups right now and who theyre throwing
4695087 but i felt good out there on the mound weve played canada enough times and i know their hitters really well i felt like i was on a roll with them if we got one run and went ahead that would be ok but we obviously went ahead and put quite a few on the board
4695088 obviously we know that we have a on our back all the time and the good thing is that we have athletes who thrive on that
4695089 bob and i think its so good that were going to try to get the league to put us in preseason on a rotation basis then we can do this every year
4695090 next year wed go to houston and the texans would come back here the year after that its just makes so much sense for both clubs
4695091 new orleans and houston have so much in common so many people in houston go to new orleans to do business and people in new orleans come to houston on a regular basis we have a lot of friends in new orleans and a lot of people in new orleans have friends in houston
4695092 its an opportunity to develop a rivalry that can become meaningful over time
4695093 id love to play the saints every year in preseason
4695094 i think they have similar philosophies in terms of how they practice
4695095 as long as they feel its productive then im certainly supportive of it i think that they would like to continue
4695096 atlanta is too but theyre in our division so that wouldnt work
4695097 houston is ideal for what we want to accomplish at a time like this
4695098 its hard to beat up on the same guys day in and day out
4695099 you beat up on the other guys a little better
4695100 weve got a lot of fans in the houston area
4695101 we had a lot of fans leave here after hurricane katrina and now theyre settled in over there it would be a good thing for fans of both teams
4695102 if a good german riesling is like an ice skater fast racy with a cutting edge and chardonnay is like a middle heavyweight boxer punchy solid powerful then viognier would have to be described as a female gymnast beautiful and perfectly shaped with muscle but superb agility and elegance
4695103 viogniers appeal is its exotic honeysuckle musky fruit its round body and most of all its mesmerizingly lanolinish texture

4695108 ive been around them my whole life even with my commercial operation i had some that were like pets but this is different
4695109 heres the thing about tusk mr king mr royalty mr special treatment when he eats watermelon he wont eat the rind you have to hold it and he eats the heart the red and hes through then you pick up another piece of watermelon and he eats that
4695110 his brothers you just throw it in and they scarf it down him hes special
4695111 if youve ever wanted to know what its like to be a rock star just make a trip with us
4695112 you will literally get mobbed its amazing how people want to see tusk be close to him and take pictures of him
4695113 at the time the atmosphere outside the game really had nothing
4695114 there was a little tailgating sure but there wasnt really an organized effort
4695115 long ears whether on a hog or a bloodhound give an animal a lazy look
4695116 when i was playing ball i used to look at that thing and say thats our mascot
4695117 apparently zoos dont like to deal with those kind of animals
4695118 and we couldnt find anything so i said keith see what you can do
4695119 he made some calls and lo and behold we tracked one down right here in our backyard in arkansas
4695120 you never know how theyre going to react so i called all over the world looking for a vet thatd do it awake and i couldnt find one
4695121 then one day i was taking my dog up the street to our personal vet and he said hed do it and he did
4695122 then they had their accreditation problems which brought a new director
4695123 he felt like with tusk that was not the direction the zoo needed to go
4695124 so i contacted lynn warren who was a nutritionist with tyson
4695125 we brought two females in from missouri and we took them and bred two litters
4695126 we ended up with 16 pigs really large litters most of the time you only get two or three
4695127 then we sorted out the males we only wanted the males because of the tusks then we narrowed it down to three
4695128 we worked with those three and eventually narrowed it down to the one that was easiest to handle and had the best disposition
4695129 by that time i had shut my hog operation down
4695130 so i said hey lets just bring them down here
4695131 im very lucky to be in this position its very fulfilling to go out and see the looks in these kids eyes
4695132 i cant tell you how many nights ive woken up in a sweat
4695133 i had a dream once i walked out the back door one morning and tusk was standing there
4695134 i keep a lock on the trailer but i imagine him getting the gate on the trailer open and jumping out going down the road
4695135 in the country nobody has more passion for any live mascot than keith stokes
4695136 we worked with tusk in a harness when he was young
4695137 but we kind of dropped the ball i can handle him pretty well by myself but hes almost 500 pounds of pure muscle very strong i dont want to rush him into a situation like that
4695138 when i saw that i thought yeah we dont need to do that until we get a better training program
4695139 the 1909 season bezdeks second as head football coach was significant because arkansas went 7 0 against a schedule that included other major colleges in fact arkansas outscored its opponents 186 18 the tough and gritty play of that squad inspired bezdek
4695140 its a generic term for the feral hog that runs these hills
4695141 one would get loose here one would get loose there and they werent going to spend the time to round those animals back up
4695142 the hogs because theyre such efficient machines can live on anything
4695143 they have no natural predators they can find a food source out of whatevers available acorns roots grubs bugs even meat theyll eat anything
4695144 the only thing a hog cant take is heat but if theres water available and mud available heats not a problem
4695145 we want as many people to see tusk as possible it never fails though theres always a car full of kids pulling up just as were leaving
4695146 i hate that it really bothers me that we cant stay for everyone but we cant i just hope people understand that were on a tight schedule
4695147 our most urgent task today is the immediate and orderly withdrawal of russian armed forces and the return of those forces to russia
4695148 all russian troops and any irregular and paramilitary forces that entered with them must leave immediately
4695149 he would also sign the accord and that russia would scrupulously respect the engagements in the accord notably those concerning the withdrawal of russian forces
4695150 this is a cease fire agreement between us and the russians facilitated by france and the united states
4695151 and we certainly should move from this temporary arrangement to an international peacekeeping force on the ground to replace the occupiers
4695152 and today this evil is very strong very nasty and very dangerous for everybody not only for us
4695153 grew up with the idea that it should never happen again
4695154 i understand the scepticism is the olympic 100 metres champion clean yeah the question is inevitable it comes with the territory as past champions have been revealed to be doped there is just no doubt the olympic champion has to carry himself as a clean athlete
4695155 on the face of it at least it is a comparable situation johnson was beaten by lewis in zurich on the run in to seoul then slipped from sight his coach charlie francis claimed he didnt know where johnson was for a long stretch there was a theory that he was nursing his wounds in jamaica lets put it this way if gay was to come here without racing and put in a winning performance some people would be very suspicious
4695156 normally the olympic favourite is the fastest man in the world with that comes a lot of pressure and thats what usain bolt is getting now that he has the world record people inside and out of jamaica expect him to win it people from the jamaica camp are coming to me and saying man dont spoil our clean sweep well thats good for me because usain hasnt run a whole series of championship races at 100 metres he has the record and im the world champion and i think that balances things off whos the favourite a lot of people think i can win it and im one of them
4695157 i know powell hurt when he lost his world record to bolt and i know he was upset when i beat him in osaka but usain seems different he doesnt seem to let things build up around him he likes to do what he does and have fun
4695158 im enjoying all of this and im looking forward to the race this is a good experience
4695159 usain simply has more ways to win at his size 6ft 5ins and 13st he shouldnt be able to move the way he does he shouldnt be able to cover 100 metres in 41 strides
4695160 listen what we have here are the three fastest men in the world anything can happen

4695169 indias commitments under the current terms of the proposed arrangement do not justify making far reaching exceptions to international non proliferation rules and norms

4695184 the guys made a lot of big plays behind me asdrubal cabrera especially ive told him about it four times since the game ended
4695185 its too early to think of those things but cliff has had as good a year as anybody
4695186 it looked like he lost his feel you turn the page on this hell bounce back
4695187 with the ball in the air i dont know why the guy was running but i thank him for that
4695188 maybe he thought it would drop all i know is that figgins is so fast i had to get off the mound and try to make a play
4695189 i always play hard but with cliff i bear down more because i know he gets groundballs
4695190 any time you have runners in scoring position against him you have to make it count
4695191 a lookout should be built in green colorbond steel a lookout in the same style as the magnificent grand canyon lookout
4695192 this will not require any tree removal and allow tourists of all ages to safely enjoy the spectacular lookout of the scenic rim
4695193 the lamington plateau remains one of australias seven most superb natural wonders
4695194 there is some urgent need for lateral thinking with the lookout sites
4695195 if it could be done at a reasonable cost out of glass then all the better otherwise green colorbond to match the landscape
4695196 its an interesting idea and well certainly have a look at what mr fischer is proposing
4695197 the club had some real difficulties with the weather and different situations on wednesday and thursday but we are happy with way things have gone so far
4695198 the crowds were quite good on thursday we had quite a few people out and about the place and yesterday we had two unofficial lap records in the superstock class
4695199 all we are hoping for now is that the sun will be shining on race day
4695200 the roads do not close until 8 30pm and weather permitting we hope not to have any delays
4695201 race fans know what it is like and from the looks of things yesterday will be staying on to watch the race we are all looking forward to the event
4695202 he has been encouraging players to use space better to improve their touch to make every pass count and to always take the right options when it comes to shooting i can tell you he has had a profound effect on the team
4695203 but of course the all ireland is the biggest and hardest to win we are looking no further than tomorrow kilkenny may be in the final but waterford is our total focus david fitzgerald has revitalised the side and we know we have a major task on our hands
4695204 we need to do better especially as dublin will be very confident
4695205 we felt the munster championship was going to be difficult on the back of travelling to cork but we needed to get back to an all ireland semi final we havent been there since 2003 to get back in with the munster final victory was needed
4695206 wassamatter ya think it gonna make soup taste any better
4695207 last year i won this class at the ulster and i was delighted that my dad was there to watch he was so proud of me and it made up for the fact that the race was run in dreadful conditions of wind and rain
4695208 since dads death at the north west i have been looking at racing differently i still feel the same about it in that i like to do my best and win if i can but at the same time im more aware than ever what can happen out on a racetrack youre here one second and gone the next
4695209 dad was a great champion of the ulster grand prix and he loved to race here look at all those years when he and my uncle joey dominated the 125cc class i doubt therell be anything like this in the immediate years to come
4695210 i always like it round here and i get a kick out of racing round what is after all a riders circuit
4695211 ill be hoping for some opposition naturally from my brother michael who was third behind me in practice
4695212 in addition ian lougher who is another regular campaigner will be close for he was second to me in the final laps
4695213 i might as well have stayed at home the bike just wasnt up to the task
4695214 ive been winning races all year and now i find im nowhere at the race i wanted to pick up most of all the ulster grand prix
4695215 this is a hard course to know and the rain doesnt help either but hopefully ill get a decent run and i may actually win this race and if i do so it will perform wonders for my confidence
4695216 im watching the two dunlops its hard to win when theyre around
4695217 this was the teaching of some churches to their people
4695218 i was told by protestants that they were and i checked it and checked it and checked it
4695219 i could never understand why it mattered that i was a catholic police ombudsman
4695220 no matter what happens to me i will never be back in drumaness again
4695221 farewell girls i am sure i wont be back i give my curse to the donnellys
4695222 we will be monitoring the situation closely and we will be talking with the airlines closer to the strike dates
4695223 however we would advise all passengers who have booked to fly on those days into gatwick or stanstead or from those two airports to belfast to contact their airline for advice
4695224 swissport believes that a fair offer has been made to the unions in the light of the current economic climate that reflects the cost of living increase
4695225 swissport is working with the airport operator and the customer airlines to minimise disruption to the travelling public
4695226 our members are already struggling to keep up with rising food and energy costs this pay offer is an insult to professional hard working men and women who have to operate in extremely difficult conditions
4695227 this result is just the first to be declared with positive ballot results expected over the next few days at stansted and manchester airports
4695228 swissport workers will also shortly be balloted at birmingham and newcastle airports which could see an escalation of industrial action across the uks airports
4695229 our members have had enough the liberalisation of ground handling services across uk airports has resulted in a race to the bottom which must and will stop we will not stand back and allow labour costs to determine whether contracts are won or lost
4695230 gmb members can not afford these low pay rises given the rising prices they have to pay for food energy and transport
4695231 the employers the airlines and the airport operator need to adjust their view as to what our members will now accept the only way they have of meeting higher prices passed on to them is to raise their own prices in higher pay rises
4695232 they got right away from the others in the early part of the straight and it might have been a bit of an issue to pick them up
4695233 i liked the win because despite drawing a good gate she didnt actually have a very easy run
4695234 she was three deep facing the breeze the whole way and i thought she finished the race off pretty well
4695235 whos to say that with a couple of runs under her belt and if we can get her to settle a bit better in her races she might run 1400 or 1600

4695251 most of these people are in good physical condition but they have been traumatized and shocked by violent events unfolding over the past week and they feared for their own safety they asked us to help with the safe passage
4695252 this would be impossible without the cooperation of russian and georgian authorities
4695253 the consequences are worrying the risk is that the trial itself cannot be conducted in the way that it should be conducted or indeed that the trial will have to be adjourned or stayed until this problem can be sorted out no one wants that this is a serious case it needs to be heard
4695254 we would not expect any cases to be delayed for lack of an appropriate advocate and solicitors have told the legal services commission that they expect to be able to find counsel of the requisite experience to act in very high cost cases

4695256 in een woord hero sch ik ben trots op wat hij heeft gedaan
4695257 hij is niet alleen de grootste zwemmer of de grootste olympi r aller tijden hij is misschien wel de grootste sporter die ooit op deze planeet heeft rondgelopen
4695258 ik deed het toen in mijn tijd in die omstandigheden en 36 jaar lang was dat onaantastbaar ik geniet ervan dat iemand is ge nspireerd door mijn prestaties van toen hij verdient het

4695263 hes doing great the doctors couldnt be more happy with whats happening the key is no setbacks we cant do too much
4695264 hes starting to show regularly that he can make plays
4695265 hes taking advantage of this early opportunity to get a lot of looks he continues to show up
4695266 although russia misleads the public with its statements about protecting the ossetians its true goal is apparently a change of regime in georgia its short term program must be to achieve a situation in which abkhazia and south ossetia could host extensive russian contingents while formally remaining georgian territories the russian force deployed will be just large enough to prevent georgia from moving closer to nato
4695267 russia can indeed call a halt to the military action the invaded georgian territories will remain occupied and their alienation from georgia is a very real prospect
4695268 russia seems to be idly pondering what the wests reaction will be and how quickly it will react if at all during the most slumberous time of the holidays when most people are on vacation or busy watching the olympics by forcibly splitting georgia moscow is trying to beat the west using its own tactics you chip off kosovo now watch us do the same with abkhazia and south ossetia
4695269 russia has indicated the impotence of the u s nato and the eu intimidated eastern europe and reminded western europe of its dependence on russias energy imports washington does not have the muscle to militarily restrain russia
4695270 putin and his war against chechen separatists were a model for the georgian government saakashvili used the experience to deal with abkhazia and south ossetia after the problem hit a dead end he learned his lessons well saakashvili has made the world doubt him
4695271 a time has come when estonia has to provide tangible proof that georgia is our foreign policy priority with more than empty words
4695272 many will certainly want to do something in the face of russias aggression against georgia from buying georgian wines to actually sending volunteers to the republic such civil initiatives can only be welcomed
4695273 georgia is important for the west as an alternative route for energy supplies and the armed conflict in that caucasian state is also leading to a clash between the west and the kremlin in their drive for influence
4695274 one of the most important aspects of the georgian conflict is that georgia is a corridor for supplying energy resources to europe from the caspian region bypassing russia russia having for the first time demonstrated the concept of defending its citizens has at the same time won a tremendous advantage for transiting oil now all the states of the black and caspian seas have their projects threatened
4695275 moscow might exploit the existing situation not only to demonstrate its military strength but also to redraw borders in the caucasus
4695276 in moscows view georgia is a test case for the western community to probe its readiness to grant russia a special right to use military strength against states that have no right to be democratic and follow a russia independent foreign policy the signal is clear to accuse russia of aggression against georgia risks being in its place we are dealing with a russia whose leaders have stopped pretending they respect the sovereign rights of other countries our neighbor is an aggressive regime
4695277 it may well be that russias far from easy relations with nato and european union countries will go into a deep freeze including a new cold war and an armed face off along the entire border line
4695278 who is running south ossetia ossetians no russians mostly those with straps on their shoulders russia has wanted a conflict both in south ossetia and abkhazia and has purposely worked for one since 1991 the aim has been to hold tbilisi by the throat if you join nato you will never see abkhazia and south ossetia we swear it with our tanks and our ability to kill the occupied civilian population
4695279 russian tanks and aircraft are pounding georgia the russians announced bank accounts to support the separatists meanwhile our authorities are taking a time out to watch the olympics is this an active ostpolitik
4695280 georgia is pleading with lithuania to support her in the conflict with russia but the leader of the country has found time only to attend a meeting of district chairmen of the lithuanian world community and the world lithuanian youth union
4695281 it can only be regretted that urgings by lithuanian diplomats and leaders of our country fell on deaf ears in tbilisi mikheil saakashvili decided to take advantage of the occasion to solve the problem once and for all the attack did not come on a whim georgia has chosen the path of war which the civilized world spurns but could the civilized world have condemned georgia if it had resolved this so called frozen conflict in one or two days even by force
4695282 the war in georgia concerns not only georgia and russia if moscow is not stopped it will take this as a sign that it can rule the roost everywhere where its so called citizens hold passports with a double headed eagle we may not have too many of them here but latvia and estonia have plenty
4695283 the new war in the caucasus will put all the other events within the former soviet union on the back burner no one doubts that the u s russia and europe will now be preoccupied with the armed conflict in the caucasus they will have no time left to deal with belarusian problems and lukashenko will hold parliamentary elections in a setting most favorable for manipulation and the doctoring of their results this is not the first instance when a global conflict has helped the lukashenko regime such was the case during the terror attack on new york which coincided with belarusian elections and history repeated itself in 2004 when the terrorists seized the school in beslan while belarus was planning a referendum on extending lukashenkos powers
4695284 what can we belarusians learn from this small but far from victorious war in the caucasus perhaps we should be ready to see in our streets russian peacekeepers in tanks protecting their gas against nasty neighbors who are unwilling to understand the meaning of the words pax russiana and accept them especially since the pretext will always be there
4695285 for georgia the results will depend on whether or not the international community sees it as an aggressor the outlook for russia is worse it is bound to lose in world public opinion in any case because however you look at it russia engaged in a war on other than its own territory nevertheless for understandable reasons things will not go beyond moral condemnation the cis however is going to have trouble surviving in its present form
4695286 russian georgian relations are the most strained in the cis territory the probability of a new conflict grows with every day georgia now has outstripped even the middle east in terms of military spending as a percentage of gdp and that is supposed to be the worlds most conflict prone region it is now the worlds second largest military spender weapons accumulated at this rate are bound to be fired one day
4695287 successfully hosting the 2014 olympics is russias top priority in the caucasus two conflicts next door to the site of the games are a problem one has to do something about there were two possible options either to reach an agreement with mikheil saakashvili and jointly stabilize the region which would have thwarted the plans of certain groups in russia engaged in smuggling with abkhazian and south ossetian accomplices or to try to subdue the region by any means available including hampering georgias nato accession plans and provoking its aggression
4695288 if we bury our heads in the sand now instead of standing up to support georgia then we might as well forget any deals with it in the future including building oil and gas bypasses around russia but if ukraine assumes a firm position if it tells russia that its aggression against georgia makes it impossible to keep its fleet in sevastopol that is if it puts forth an ultimatum it would be a real act of support for georgia and will cut russia down to size it would help achieve some progress on the russian fleets withdrawal from sevastopol into the bargain if ukraine does not stand with georgia now russia will view it as weakness and quickly defeat us too in the crimea and sevastopol it is a strategic issue for ukraine
4695289 the russian georgian war was yet another proof that the current world order is distorted and illogical moscow thinks that what is allowed to vladimir putin is not allowed to mikheil saakashvili the russian prime minister even had the nerve to act as a peace mediator condemning tbilisis actions as genocide and to teach georgia morals claiming it has lost all rights to the breakaway region
4695290 by urgently launching the process to recognize the self proclaimed republics russia could radically stop the escalation of tensions around them there is nothing more to discuss about their future they will be independent from georgia forever whether saakashvili recognizes it or not
4695291 humiliated by the georgian failure the west will certainly try to get revenge although similar atrocities and genocide are unlikely to occur in transdnestr local residents will be gradually manipulated into making the right choice of the western master now that they are locked between ukraine which sides with saakashvili and the cunning moldova ready to sell anything it owns for thirty pieces of silver to anyone who will pay
4695292 russia has two centers of authority the first one being vladimir putins siloviki or members of the security services the military and the police and the other one being dmitry medvedevs liberals mikheil saakashvili may have thought that such a dual power in russia would make it possible to smoothly bring south ossetia back into georgia since after giving up south ossetia medvedevs wing could hope to gain actual control with the assistance of the international community if moscow had not decided to put its foot into the ossetian quagmire medvedev would have become a person favored in the wests eyes though he could have met some resistance from russias imperial circles this was medvedevs only way to power and georgia showed it to him but he failed to notice it
4695293 russias plan does not imply any mutual compromises moscow tskhinvali and sukhumi unanimously demand that the agreement on non use of force be signed claiming that otherwise the talks are devoid of sense the major thing about kremlins plan for resolving the conflict is the absence of any resolution what moscow proposes in the guise of peaceful talks is called differently a capitulation the key issues the breakaway regions status and the return of refugees are not only being shelved but becoming officially irresolvable russia has found a pretext to bring its regular troops into georgia and now will try to bargain to the maximum to receive the most and realize its dreams if russia succeeds the country will gain great benefits it will have a direct land passage to iran thus obtaining a new tool for putting pressure on europe and the united states
4695294 when fascism wins in russia and this fascist and brown shirted country knocks on europes door europe will start considering serious steps against russia but it will be too late if it becomes a fascist state this will be more dangerous for the world than nazi germany
4695295 russias actions are a slap in the face of the civilized international community and if this community still has any self respect it has to come to its senses
4695296 russia will surely face an acutely aggravated attitude from the western countries particularly the u s and from most countries in eastern europe russia will face serious obstructions from european union countries it has also spoilt its relations with post soviet states which feel they may possibly become future targets of russian aggression
4695297 the u s is eager to involve russia in the conflict and then use the situation to its own benefit
4695298 the lack of neighborliness between russia and georgia reflects strategic contradictions between russia and the u s russian officials have repeatedly announced that if georgia and ukraine enter nato moscow will take actions to secure its own interests after these events georgia will have to carefully weigh its further steps with one eye always on russia
4695299 georgias actions are a model scheme for resolving the ethnic conflict for azerbaijan to borrow we will be very happy if georgia wins
4695300 russia has demonstrated it is ready to destroy whole countries and nations to pursue its own imperial ambitions
4695301 the latest events in georgia have revealed that russia is an empire which does not intend to change the russians will soon be forced to sign a truce and if georgia holds out for several more days we will witness russias shameful departure from the southern caucasus despite the sharp statements of the russian authorities the countrys army is facing a deep crisis
4695302 south ossetia is formally a georgian territory so tbilisi did not attack russia with its onslaught it is hard however to appeal to international law after iraq and kosovo medvedev and putin for their part say they are defending russian citizens who make up more than 80 of the south ossetian population oil or oil and gas transportation to be more precise is a pronounced factor here as in many other 21st century wars and conflicts we can also say that russia is anxious to prevent a nato presence on its south approaches astana will hold the presidency of the osce in 2010 the problem of self proclaimed states will not disappear from the osce agenda by that time and kazakhstan will have to prove its worth as a peacekeeper because peace in the caucasus is certainly in its interests
4695303 russian diplomacy in central asia and transcaucasia is extremely passive compared to the u
4695304 rovian tactics which consist of avoiding real issues and focusing on wedge issues
4695305 the big question is not what pervez musharraf is going to do but whats going to happen to him next

4695322 it was a question to share or not share first place
4695323 with everything we saw the first arrival was michael phelps
4695324 i had no idea that there was a protest this is the first word i have heard of it
4695325 the timing system said it all there hasnt really ever been in an error in the timing system that i have heard of
4695326 if it was up to me i would drop the protest i didnt want to fight it its a gold medal its difficult to lose but i have to remember my goal here was bronze
4695327 if we went through this again i would win it
4695328 its hard to argue with the electronics system the problem for milorad was that his touch was too soft if the race is tight youve got to be hard on the wall
4695329 i personally looked at the video footage and it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4695330 it was clear from the video that it was an issue of stroking one was stroking and the other was gliding
4695331 according to our rules we used automatic timing system and in this case it was in perfect condition in perfect order and there are no doubts it provides for the competition at these olympic games
4695332 after watching the video footage i met with the serbian officials and gave them an explanation and offered them an opportunity to see the video themselves
4695333 we have to be fairer to rooney this season he is such a willing performer that you are tempted to listen to him at times

4695335 as was the idea of stripping down the presidency to a figurehead role

4695340 the big question is not what pervez musharraf is going to do but whats going to happen to him next
4695341 i dont think he can be given safe passage anywhere except to jail if you think about it it would be a problem for any country to take him in because al qaeda has said that he will be unsafe wherever he goes

4695370 it was just a great race to be a part of just a spectacle
4695371 in international trade there is not an exchange of equivalents because just as in the domestic market there is a tendency toward equalization of profit rates therefore the commodities of the highly developed capitalist country that is of a country with a higher organic composition of capital are sold at prices of production 5 which are always greater than their values on the other hand the commodities of countries with a lower organic composition of capital are sold under free competition at prices of production that as a general rule must be less than their values in this manner transfers of the surplus value produced in the less developed country take place within the sphere of circulation in the world market since the distribution of the surplus value is not according to the number of workers employed but according to the magnitude of the capital involved
4695372 from the fact that the profit the average revenue drawn by the total capital employed in a given inter national unit ei may be less than the surplus value the amount of value produced by industry over and above the cost of employing the labour power of the workers required to produce it ei it follows that not only individual capitalists but nations too may continuously exchange with one another without gaining equally thereby one nation may continuously appropriate part of the surplus labour of the other and give nothing in exchange for it except that here the measure is not as in the exchange between capitalist and worker
4695373 state intervention has falsified the natural economic relation the different national wages must therefore be calculated on the assumption that the part of them that goes to the state in the form of taxes was received by the worker himself eternal laws of nature and reason whose free and harmonious working was only disturbed by the intervention of the state state intervention i e the defence of those laws of nature and reason by the state alias the system of protection was necessitated
4695374 there is no fluidity in the world transmission of technology of population of capital as a totality there is a national average both of wages and of the organic composition of capital
4695375 objectively or relatively the product of a less developed national capital contains a greater proportion of labor value
4695376 the essence or foundation of dependency as marx would say is the transfer of surplus value from a less developed total national capital to the one that is more developed it is necessary to compensate for this loss by extracting more surplus value from living labour in the periphery dependent capital hence drives the value of the wage below the value necessary to reproduce the capacity to work with all the known consequences at the same time it intensifies the use of this labour by reducing the time necessary to reproduce the value of the wage relatively and in new ways
4695377 in the case of a product produced in mexico and in detroit within competition because monopoly situations are built albeit negatively from competition it is necessary to distinguish between the
4695378 the process of national in the sense of necessitating a united front between all patriotic anti imperialist classes ei and popular in the sense of this united front being led by the working classes ei liberation is the only way to destroy the mechanism of constant and increasing transference of surplus value from the less developed total national capital this assumes overcoming capitalism as such since the extraction of surplus value a living capital labour relation is articulated to the transfer of surplus value in the competition between total national capitals of different levels of development
4695379 there are many well meaning people both in the imperialist countries and the third world who still have illusions as to the usefulness of private investment in the underdeveloped countries it is simple to make the following calculation a foreign private enterprise sets up in a third world country where it makes a regular yearly profit of 10 percent on its investment if the whole of these profits are transferred abroad at the end of the tenth year an amount equal to the original investment will have been exported from the eleventh year onwards the receiving country will be exporting currency which it has not received in twenty years it will have exported twice as much etc if the rate of profit is 20 percent instead of 10 percent the outflow will begin twice as early if only half the profits are exported the process will be only half as rapid this example is a somewhat oversimplified hypothesis but reflects reality there is no end to the loss in third world national wealth through such outflows except through nationalisation or socialisation of the enterprises
4695380 the prices which arise by drawing the average of the various rates of profit of the different spheres of production and adding this average to the cost prices of the different spheres of production are the prices of production
4695381 typically the method of production of agricultural goods requires a relatively smaller constant capital in comparison with industrial goods should the rate of profit be equalized between two trading countries having the same rate of exploitation of labour the country specializing in the export of agricultural goods therefore would suffer a loss of surplus in the process of exchange
4695382 the price of a commodity is a multiple of the sum of constant and variable capitals the multiplier being given by simply one plus the rate of profit if for one reason or another the wage rate is reduced ceteris paribus other things being equal the price of the commodity will be lower as the variable capital declines so it will command in exchange less labour than it was doing before
4695383 on the world market national labour which is more productive also counts as more intensive as long as the productive nation is not compelled by competition to lower the selling price of its commodities to the level of their value

4695389 it was a question to share or not share first place
4695390 with everything we saw the first arrival was michael phelps
4695391 i had no idea that there was a protest this is the first word i have heard of it
4695392 the timing system said it all there hasnt really ever been in an error in the timing system that i have heard of
4695393 if it was up to me i would drop the protest i didnt want to fight it its a gold medal its difficult to lose but i have to remember my goal here was bronze
4695394 if we went through this again i would win it
4695395 its hard to argue with the electronics system the problem for milorad was that his touch was too soft if the race is tight youve got to be hard on the wall
4695396 i personally looked at the video footage and it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4695397 it was clear from the video that it was an issue of stroking one was stroking and the other was gliding
4695398 according to our rules we used automatic timing system and in this case it was in perfect condition in perfect order and there are no doubts it provides for the competition at these olympic games
4695399 after watching the video footage i met with the serbian officials and gave them an explanation and offered them an opportunity to see the video themselves we didnt want them to go to sleep thinking something was lost

4695409 it is our opinion that the saddleback church forum failed to publish any pre established objective criteria for inviting candidates to the event
4695410 because of saddlebacks apparent failure to comply with campaign finance laws the exclusion of bob barr appears to be an illegal corporate in kind contribution to senators obama and mccain
4695411 plaintiffs will lose out on a fair amount of exposure and the opportunity to express their views in a popular forum
4695412 on the other hand halting this event would deny the other candidates the opportunity to be heard and would deprive the public of an opportunity to see the candidates and hear their views

4695425 ku is fortunate to have such a beautiful regrowth forest thats at least 60 years old

4695473 i would say that hes not completely out of the picture still

4695496 are positive steps to help strengthen relations in the interests of the two countries
4695497 i dont think you can control all the world from one centre
4695498 there are big nations there are huge populations there is unbelievable economic development in some parts of the world so what we have to do is instead of unilateral actions act all together make common decisions and have consultations with the world a new world order if i can say it should emerge
4695499 there are so many important issues like the nuclear issue iraq the caucasus afghanistan
4695500 iran is definitely having some influence of these issues so we are talking
4695501 we dont want to see weapons of mass destruction in this region
4695502 if its in our neighbourhood we definitely dont want to see it
4695503 i dont want to think about that everybody should take a lesson from what happened in iraq
4695504 i wish to see turkey as an island where the european standard of democracy is being fulfilled and the free market economy is functioning very well
4695505 this will be a real gift to the region to the world for peace and this turkey will be a source of inspiration for so many
4695506 as we are transforming ourselves in that direction we will not forget our natural links and relationships and advantages with other countries muslim countries central asian countries caucasus countries middle eastern and other countries
4695507 turkey is having a positive impact on them spreading the values of democracy freedom rule of law also the economic changes here are admired maybe that is the indirect influence of this country
4695508 in the last two years we spent our energy on domestic issues and the reforms slowed down
4695509 now after the court case there is a new era this is a big opportunity for turkey everybody realises that reforms are necessary
4695510 turkey has great capacity to influence the region indirectly very peacefully being an inspiration for changes turkey has been playing this role already this has not been appreciated enough
4695511 europe should realise that turkey can do more for the stability and security of the region
4695512 start with the caucasus last month the problem was not serious but suddenly we found ourselves in a war situation
4695513 europe should encourage turkey and not create some artificial problems during the negotiation process with us some member countries or some politicians should not mix domestic issues and strategic issues domestic issues are conjunctural today its there and tomorrow its not but the strategic issues are always there and we cannot sacrifice strategic issues for domestic issues unfortunately nowadays we see this kind of shortsighted policies in some countries
4695514 some call it terror some call it the south east problem some call it the kurdish problem whatever you call it we will find a solution
4695515 there are other problems secularism and anti secularism those things will also find solutions in this climate that is why i focus on the reform process the problem was this the lack of democracy the standard of democracy that was creating problems not only in the south east but in other issues that is when we upgrade the standards these problems will find solutions
4695516 but having a good relationship helps the stability of the region

4695559 i cannot in good conscience give my money to a system that doesnt provide justice

4695590 take the blasphemer outside the camp all those who heard him are to lay their hands on his head and the entire assembly is to stone him

4695604 i dont know if i could swim that many events in 2004 it was the same thing i know she had an amazing homecoming when she did go back home i think in a situation like that you have to be happy for somebody

4695614 it just keeps spreading from one asset to another so its hard to know when these writedowns will stop
4695615 the u s economy needs to stabilize first but even then europe could lag and recover later theres still a lot more downside
4695616 i knew at the worst it was going to be a sacrifice fly
4695617 our team battled to the end they scored some runs and we came back they scored again and we came back again
4695618 i went with my best pitch the fastball and he hit it
4695619 she was just standing in the driveway rocking the newborn who was still attached to the placenta
4695620 we have a lock down situation we have cameras but the question we had to answer is what if somebody gets in what are we going to do
4695621 one player has the ball running all over the field with nine receivers and no offensive linemen
4695622 our guys improved every week the last two thirds of the season and in the bowl game they understand game speed now hudson said
4695623 youve got to stop the run and get the ball back said hudson who served on holtzs staff at connecticut then rejoined him at ecu in 2004
4695624 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4695625 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4695626 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4695627 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4695628 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4695629 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4695630 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4695631 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4695632 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4695633 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4695634 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4695635 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4695636 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4695637 i hated the gooks i will hate them as long as i live
4695638 if it was up to me i would just drop the protest
4695639 im stoked with what happened i dont want to fight this
4695640 is michael phelps the gold medal winner i think if we got to do this again i would win it
4695641 i feel sorry for liu yan my heart is full of regrets
4695642 im deeply sorry liu yan is a heroine she sacrificed a lot for the olympics for me for the opening ceremony
4695643 i regret many things many details of this performance many things i could have done better
4695644 for example there are performers who were injured i blame myself for that it might well have been avoided if i had given more detailed instructions
4695645 until beijing id never heard of either of them just who are they
4695646 you never need to worry about her not practicing hard enough
4695647 she will not complain no matter how heavy the pressure is
4695648 she will just cry out silently or unburden herself to her parents by phone
4695649 i didnt feel pressure before the competition i just tried to relax
4695650 foreigners always keep a very close eye on the chinese swimming team for doping problems
4695651 why do they always feel its abnormal when we do well in the pool
4695652 i was starting to hurt a little bit with probably the last 10 meters
4695653 that was my last individual race so i was just trying to finish as strong as i could
4695654 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time hes the greatest racer who ever walked the planet
4695655 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4695656 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4695657 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4695658 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4695659 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4695660 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i lost the race there but i guess that was the difference in the race
4695661 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4695662 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4695663 i wasnt going to at first then i was saying to myself this race is going to be very tight and im going to use everything i got so i put it out there
4695664 i always welcome comments it definitely motivates me even more
4695665 im so proud of what hes been able to do
4695666 i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now
4695667 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4695668 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4695669 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4695670 every time you race phelps youll have a great race and a great time just hearing his arms slap on the block gets your heart racing hes amazing im so happy to get the medal
4695671 why is cbc paying attention to michael phelps well hes possibly the greatest amateur athlete of all time and the biggest story of the olympics
4695672 phelps is amazing this guy is dominating his sport like no other like wayne gretzky and michael jordan in their day
4695673 michael phelps is the worlds best swimmer right now and he is on the verge of fulfilling a great achievement
4695674 we were left with no alternative that this process must be stopped
4695675 up to this morning friday there was not even a conference notice
4695676 they then insisted that they want to continue with the conference
4695677 the pec of the anc is still the authority force in the province until the next provincial conference
4695678 people are talking and finding out how bad it was going with their nominations to such extent that they are trying for court interdicts to stop the conference
4695679 we are still optimistic that a solution shall be found and that a conducive environment shall prevail for us to start focusing on mobilising resources for president jacob zuma in his court battle we are fully behind our president
4695680 they were caught red handed in the signal room with cables and devices unfortunately they had already damaged the system
4695681 we would like to send condolences to the family of the worker who tragically died at the peter mokaba stadium site in polokwane today friday
4695682 it is the first death recorded during the 2010 fifa world cup process and we learnt of this incident with great sadness
4695683 this is a big blow and we want to send our heartfelt condolences to the family of the worker we cannot release his name until his family has been properly notified
4695684 we have closed the site until monday and a number of people on site are being counselled
4695685 there are over 20 000 workers on site daily at all 10 fifa world cup stadiums we would like to pay tribute to each and every one of them today
4695686 say please ask nicely be sure to share look at a person when you speak to them
4695687 when i was studying so hard i thought the most important thing was freedom you cant demand freedom from this society your school or even from your family you must rely on yourself to find your freedom if you can set your own heart free then nothing can stop you
4695688 this movies scrabble brained approach to religious faith makes the new
4695689 inspirational sometimes all of us forget that love for movies that internal spark inside us that movies lit and overstreets book is going to remind many of us about it
4695690 when the students are done well publish our new nba betting work
4695691 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4695692 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4695693 i think the russian behavior over the last several days is generally concerning not only to the united states but to all of our european allies
4695694 i was starting to hurt a little bit with probably the last 10 meters that was my last individual race so i was just trying to finish as strong as i could
4695695 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first

4695699 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4695700 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4695701 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4695702 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4695703 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4695704 some men change their party for the sake of their principles others their principles for the sake of their party
4695705 moderation in temper is always a virtue but moderation in principle is always a vice
4695706 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
4695707 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
4695708 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
4695709 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
4695710 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction
4695711 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it
4695712 a cynical mercenary demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself
4695713 the minute you read something that you cant understand you can almost be sure that it was drawn up by a lawyer
4695714 laws control the lesser man right conduct controls the greater one
4695715 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
4695716 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
4695717 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
4695718 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
4695719 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
4695720 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
4695721 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
4695722 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
4695723 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
4695724 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life
4695725 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote
4695726 whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce
4695727 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
4695728 the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they dont turn against him they crush those beneath them
4695729 patriotism is the conviction that your country is superior to all others because you were born in it
4695730 freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear
4695731 anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist
4695732 fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power
4695733 corporation n an ingenious device for obtaining profit without individual responsibility
4695734 the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in time of great moral crises maintain their neutrality
4695735 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
4695736 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
4695737 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
4695738 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
4695739 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
4695740 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money
4695741 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent
4695742 if we dont change our direction were likely to end up where were headed
4695743 there are a lot of exiles in this world each one has his own reason we have ours long before we left america the america we knew left us we travel not to get away from it but to find it
4695744 while each of us is entitled to his own opinions none of us is entitled to his own facts
4695745 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress
4695746 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
4695747 a morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always valuable
4695748 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
4695749 in the beginning of change the patriot is a scarce man and brave and hated and scorned when his cause succeeds the timid join him for it then costs nothing to be a patriot
4695750 the first step in the evolution of ethics is a sense of solidarity with other human beings
4695751 the human race has improved everything except the human race adlai stephenson
4695752 earth provides enough to satisfy every mans need but not every mans greed
4695753 if you tremble indignation at every injustice then you are a comrade of mine
4695754 try not to become a man of success but rather try to become a man of value

4695758 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century

4695773 its clearly a very emotional time but i think that it should still be seen that this was a productive day i hope now that peace can return to georgia and georgians can return to a normal life
4695774 i ease dont conceive either digit of them is at a saucer to be in a serious sworn relationship but they intend along and hit recreation together

4695873 we were aware that we werent welcome we were aware that we werent getting any help and that we had zero access to the ministry of fisheries we couldnt engage them at all

4696072 bukan kedua kereta itu bertabrakan tapi salah satunya justru dalam posisi berhenti menunggu ka limex itu lewat tapi ternyata karena posisinya sudah relatif dekat ka limex harus mengerem mendadak dan mengakibatkan kecelakaan itu

4696076 karena ka limex harus mengerem mendadak itulah terjadi himpitan stasiun yang dituju diduga kebanyakan penumpang mendekati pintu masing masing gerbong untuk bersiap keluar lebih dulu

4696081 porque la muerte es parte de la vida se ha desnaturalizado la medicina materialista la vive como un fracaso de la ciencia y con todo ello hemos perdido la posibilidad de prepararnos para dar ese paso con lucidez
4696082 hablar de ella provoca una sensaci n desagradable por el vac o intelectual porque no se puede razonar y no hallar respuestas genera angustia algo que a diferencia del miedo no puede asociarse a nada concreto
4696083 la muerte por otra parte es el fracaso de la ciencia como ente y del m dico como sujeto no es raro prosigue que sea el m dico el primero en sentir la imposibilidad de hablar de ella pues le enfrenta con su propia finitud y la de su tarea luego est n la familia y los seres queridos no quieren que el paciente muera y hablar de ello es aceptar que suceder la gran carencia es la no aceptaci n de la muerte
4696084 cuando el familiar interna al enfermo terminal quiere pensar que lo hace porque en casa no puede darle los cuidados necesarios y si bien puede ser as sabe que en realidad lo interna porque no quiere que se le muera a l eso le enfrentar a una vez m s con las culpas y las propias imposibilidades
4696085 las encuestas constatan que la gente se siente abandonada en el duelo hay que acercarse al modelo ingl s m s comunitario atento al rea emocional y al sufrimiento que incluye terapias alternativas atenci n al duelo la sociedad se ha quedado sin mecanismos como el luto para socializar y elaborar el duelo nos parece que con ni os en casa no podemos tener a un enfermo terminal

4696088 just as bajaj is focussing on higher cc bikes it is not refreshing its entry level models around 100 cc engines this is among the reasons behind the decline in its market share
4696089 it used to be around 91 92 at one time but has come down to around 65 last fiscal so we are not worried as we are losing market share only in a declining segment and gaining ground in the 125cc plus segment which is a growing market
4696090 no question of making investments in a segment that was not profitable and declining

4696116 im actually kind of nervous and the reason why is that i think about what we did last year as a whole unit
4696117 were going to try to come out and put points on the board because thats what were coached and asked to do but the expectation the bar is set so high here not by you all not by the fans but by the coaches and the team
4696118 we have high expectations for this offense and this team as a unit but what we did last year i dont think we can really live and dwell off that because that was last year
4696119 like i said its a little bit of nervousness because i know how high the bar is here
4696120 i just think that first and foremost we have some unfinished business
4696121 i like the camaraderie around here especially in the locker room on the field weve got a great group of guys in the locker room i think thats all you can ask for and coaching coach belichick understands football and understands his players and really puts us together as one we come together as a team and thats what you can definitely respect playing in this profession playing in this league
4696122 the good thing that i can really say about our offense and im speaking for myself is that you had guys that came in late myself chad jackson was hurt last year and wes welker coming in last year so for us to have a whole offseason a training camp to really understand the offense and the concept is really scary
4696123 we will make that decision between now and when we leave today

4696163 we got so much out of this playing two very good 4 a teams
4696164 mike engles a linebacker and tailback is going to play quarterback greg jones tailback gus goodson and receiver kassun williams also looked good
4696165 going against clayton we knew were going to play a physical well coached team
4696166 terrell hartsfield linebacker and our defensive ends keaton epps and jake kahut played well
4696167 after tuesday we were out of kindergarten now were out of the first grade but i like our attitude
4696168 brandon byars made some good catches and blocked well connor mclaurins done a good job at linebacker and backup tailback jeremiah davis has shown me something
4696169 zach and mark wilder at linebacker came ready to play for us
4696170 there has been no meeting between nawaz and any saudi official in the last 48 hours or even in the last four weeks
4696171 my first guess is sofia especially since shes not in the promo pics what do you think with the loss of two of the characters well be gaining two more in wyatt and roland executive producer zack estrin spills more of the details to kristin wyatt wyatt is the company guy who is tracking the brothers when the season opens there is a cover story that says that the brothers are placed into a supermax prison but slowly clues come out that they are not in prison and are in fact up to something else wyatts job is to find out what theyre really up to
4696172 yet another example of irresponsible publicity hungry security researchers trying to grab a few headlines
4696173 im feeling pretty good but if youd asked me this time last week i would have said i was no chance i saw my local physio this morning and he said it was a completely different tendon to the one he treated last week he was really worried its a race against the clock given its rapid improvement from last week im certainly a chance but i cant give a definite answer whether im in or out
4696174 ive got to be careful i dont take any risks over the next month or so given what we have ahead of us ill certainly be conservative with it

4696177 we have a lock down situation we have cameras but the question we had to answer is what if somebody gets in what are we going to do
4696178 i always said if i had an opportunity to come back here this would be a place id love to play
4696179 i think that experience helped me make my decision and hopefully helped them make their decision and im very excited about it
4696180 this is a place where theyve utilized veteran guys very well
4696181 and when someone has a track record youre interested in being a part of that
4696182 the fact that theyve been very successful makes it a place where a lot of people want to be but you also understand that a lot of what theyve done in the past doesnt really stand for a whole lot right now
4696183 he is a guy i have admired for a long time his playing style and his production i have a lot of respect for john the way he plays and the way he prepares
4696184 you try to emulate guys that are the best and take little parts of their game
4696185 hes a guy ive always respected for the passion he plays with
4696186 im still on the team though so its still all good
4696187 seeing that hes a rookie i dont think i have to do a whole lot
4696188 but ill take care of him ill take him out to dinner or something
4696189 im doing this just to show how innocuous this stuff is
4696190 no tengo nada que ver en todo este esc ndalo
4696191 es verdad que a diego lo conozco del gimnasio nos cruzamos una vez por semana porque coincidimos en el mismo horario pero nada m s y a carolina tambi n la conozco
4696192 power football oh my goodness that sounds awesome enough to be a mini crappy boring 1d flash sports game
4696193 if i really were to go alone i will have only 45mins to reach there and i need 30mins to s
4696194 one reason i refuse to bother with the whole security circus is that i think it glorifies and thus encourages the wrong behavior it makes heroes out of security people as if the people who dont just fix normal bugs arent as important in fact all the boring normal bugs are way more important just because theres a lot more of them
4696195 mak ing such a big deal about concentrating on security to the point where they pretty much admit that nothing else matters to them
4696196 revels in exposing vendor security holes because they see that as just another proof that the vendors are corrupt and crap which admittedly mostly are
4696197 both camps point fingers at each other as a way to cement their own reason for existence
4696198 you need to fix things early and that requires a certain level of disclosure for the developers
4696199 you also dont need to make a big production out of it
4696200 what does the whole security labeling give you except for more fodder for either of the pr camps that i obviously think are both idiots pushing for their own agenda
4696201 any situation that allows the vendor to sit on the bug for weeks or months is unacceptable as is any situation that makes it harder for people who find problems to talk to technical people
4696202 so the whole embargoes are good mentality is just corruption from the vendors
4696203 but on the other hand disclosure should not be the goal
4696204 have a model where security is easier to do in the first place that is the unix model but make it easy for people to report bugs with no embargo but privately
4696205 even then i will forward it to technical people on an as needed basis because even that embargo secrecy is not some insane absolute thing
4696206 i was starting to hurt a little bit with probably the last 10 meters that was my last individual race so i was just trying to finish as strong as i could
4696207 we believe the top four is achievable maybe not this season but in time why not
4696208 as a club weve only had two top 10 finishes in the premier league so that is a target as well a best finish of seventh and thats a target too
4696209 at the same time its important we play attractive football
4696210 we are very very happy with our squad and with the players we have at our disposal
4696211 we feel we can challenge anyone in the country we are on the right lines
4696212 since were only on day four of our implementation lets just say if apps were on my baseball team it would be hitting at the bottom of the lineup
4696213 for me as the google apps administrator the disruption was pretty damn irritating aside from getting kicked out of e mail i need to do my own job it also forced me to completely refocus on figuring out whats happening with gmail and google apps
4696214 it was constant troubleshooting testing research posting to the google apps forums and so on plus theres the emotional strain of wondering whether you completely screwed up by moving everyone to google apps as our sole e mail system thats what freaked me out did google just make me look like an idiot
4696215 the objective is for us to progress we have the quality to compete in this league
4696216 we will show everyone and if we progress we have the chance to win the title
4696217 i cant wait for the season to start it is going to be an exciting one and we will be up for it
4696218 i think every manager wants another couple of players and im no different we are continuing to work hard to bring players in that will help the areas of the pitch that need some assistance at the moment
4696219 potentially one or two players are going to play out of position at the weekend in an ideal world wed have had a few more bodies in but lets wait and see
4696220 theres a determination to go where we wanted to go last season before it went wrong
4696221 the impact players we bought to change games were always on the treatment table and it was so frustrating
4696222 time stood still for us for a year because everyone we tried to bring in in terms of knowledge and experience was injured
4696223 were delighted with what weve done over the summer and we think the squad is even stronger
4696224 we finished fantastically well and if you look at the teams in there it was a remarkable run the fans have higher expectations now and rightly so
4696225 its good to see that the ticket sales have gone extremely well because they play their part
4696226 incey was great for me and the team hes a born leader
4696227 he was an influential player for us and a great ambassador for the game im happy hes in the premier league
4696228 im not surprised hes in management and has found his way to the premier league im surprised he didnt start there but i wish him all the best
4696229 its nice to get the season started we know everton are a good side but we a confident and we are looking forward to the match
4696230 i want us to go there put in a good performance and get something too
4696231 it has been a hectic summer and theres been a lot going on so its great to finally get under way
4696232 results against the big four wont make or break our season but they would certainly help we have a great game to start it would be fantastic to get off the mark
4696233 last season we had close games against the top teams and ended with nothing
4696234 but lets not take our eye off the ball the priority is always to try to beat the teams down and around you
4696235 you must be optimistic when you have a squad like ours
4696236 the age of the squad is much lower they are good players and can be a very good team for now and the future
4696237 our fans want a trophy every season they would want all four but if you asked me which i would prefer i would agree with them and say the league
4696238 theres no doubt that this is set to be the biggest season of my career in football
4696239 i didnt manage to play top flight football so far ive been an assistant manager and a first team coach in the premier league
4696240 but to manage in the premier league has always been an ambition of mine im about to realise that dream
4696241 most teams prefer to stay away from newly promoted teams in the early part of the season because they often start like a house on fire
4696242 i cant say it is a draw we would have chosen but you play every team twice
4696243 hull might not be one of the teams tipped for the top but we are aware they will be firing on all cylinders
4696244 maria assunta in cielo ci ricorda che tutto il nostro essere spirito anima e corpo destinato alla pienezza della vita

4696246 contro falsa gioia e dolore dobbiamo imparare da maria a diventare segni di speranza e di consolazione
4696247 our main finding was that reward dependence is the only personality dimension correlated with opiate receptor binding and that positive correlation was restricted to the ventral striatum which is considered the key area of the human reward system and of the development of addictive behavior
4696248 this correlation means that people with high reward dependence have a high concentration of opiate receptors available in that area while people with low dependence have fewer opiate receptors
4696249 this is a novel finding and will provide a deeper understanding of the functional relation between human personality neurobiology and addictive behavior
4696250 understanding the central role of neurotransmission processes in certain brain structures for the expression of psychologically defined constructs such as personality will make a great difference in the future of medicine
4696251 is that it shows that pet technology is capable of detecting subtle biochemical differences in the brain in healthy persons which may ultimately be responsible for what we consider the individual personality this has far reaching implications not only for choosing the best individual treatments but also in discussions of an individuals free will
4696252 opiod receptor pet reveals the psycholobiologic correlates of reward processing
4696253 you only agreed to the dinner because we were well into our fourth bottle of wine
4696254 with a giant franchise like harry potter in the market we had to stay clear of it
4696255 their move created an opportunity to bring the movie to fans three weeks earlier who have continued to show their enthusiasm from comic con to the giant breaking dawn book sales we felt we had to take that opportunity
4696256 so when you make them into a movie youd better be shooting for a pretty high standard youre not always going to reach it but you have to be shooting for it were going to make a justice league movie whether its now or 10 years from now but were not going to do it and warners is not going to do it until we know its right
4696257 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4696258 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4696259 absolutely clearly demonstrates what we had said earlier the deployment has the russian federation as its target
4696260 it is sad news for all who live on this densely populated continent but it is not dramatic
4696261 poland is an independent country and its an ally of the united states and its a democratic country to whose security the united states is committed
4696262 russia should welcome having democracies on its border not threaten them
4696263 i think the russian behavior over the last several days is generally concerning not only to the united states but to all of our european allies
4696264 el mundo ha visto con inquietud c mo rusia invad a un estado soberano vecino y amenazaba a un gobierno elegido democr ticamente por su pueblo
4696265 completamente inaceptable para las naciones libres del mundo las acciones emprendidas por rusia en georgia
4696266 para comenzar a reparar el da o que ha causado a sus relaciones con estados unidos europa y otros pa ses y para empezar a recuperar su lugar en el mundo
4696267 la soberan a de georgia sobre abjasia y osetia del sur es inapelable

4696303 its unfair how the government fines us for selling ara when selling of army welfare project awp liquor products are permitted
4696304 it also benefits poor farmers who come all the way from their villages with ara to barter with other items like rice salt and oil
4696305 awp products are permitted to be sold because theyreauctioned and government earns tax in turn

4696308 we cannot let lack of energy become a constraint on our ability to deliver high levels of growth with the challenges of oil prices and climate change the question of energy security confronts us
4696309 we need to look at energy mixes that are sustainable in the long run and are cleaner sources of energy gradually making a deliberate shift to renewable energy
4696310 we should aim at enhancing productivity by using better technology and innovative farming practices

4696317 all these could have been prevented we were screaming shouting to the world that russia was going to do it
4696318 ive been really surprised that people think its just a case of turning up and well beat stoke
4696319 thats not the case stoke will prove to everybody this season that theyre a really difficult opponent
4696320 we are hoping to bring in a couple of players we have to add more quality to the squad and we are working very very hard to do that
4696321 clubs established in the premier league already have that in place it is an area we will have to improve on
4696322 incey was great for me and the team hes a born leader
4696323 he was an influential player for us and a great ambassador for the game im happy hes in the premier league

4696347 i am still pretty hopeful and certainly a lot more hopeful than i was last year when no one was talking about me
4696348 its a good place to be though just out of the side because everyone thinks you are a better player than what you are
4696349 i think i am hungrier for england success now and certainly my point of view is different
4696350 ive always wanted to play for england but it was test cricket as the be all and end all
4696351 but through captaincy at kent and given we have been a successful side i have become hungrier to play every form of the game for england
4696352 i feel a better player now than i was when i was selected originally
4696353 looking back i probably played a bit too early at 23 if i dont play for england between now and the end of my career i will probably have a regret that i didnt do it when i was perhaps best suited to it
4696354 every big game weve had he has stood up and played an innings
4696355 when i was a young guy i used to look at carl hooper and think it would be good if hoops could have an innings today
4696356 whereas joe thinks this is about me today im going to win the game for kent
4696357 we always hear about temperament these young guys who are picked for england what have they done in big games
4696358 that is what i would be looking at how has he fared against the best bowling attack how has he done against steve harmison at durham
4696359 he played brilliantly in the semi final and scored a hundred at a time when harmison was bowling so well we could not believe he was not in the england team
4696360 we have had a number of outstanding individual performances from a lot of different players which have won us games on numerous occasions
4696361 guys are very clear on their roles and have been very focused on executing their skills the other thing is that momentum plays a huge part in one day cricket and when you keep winning it becomes a habit
4696362 the guys were extremely disappointed that we didnt play our best cricket on twenty20 finals day which is a shame because we wanted to express ourselves on that big stage

4696371 the great world religions buddhism and christianity suggest that awareness begins in pain

4696373 davidle first visited the city of david it was in such a state of disrepair and neglect that the former excavations that had once been conducted were once again concealed beneath garbage and waste inspired by the historical record of archeological discoveries made in the city of david in prior years and by the longing of the jewish people to return to zion davidle left the army to establish elad
4696374 to get a jewish foothold in east jerusalem and to create an irreversible situation in the holy basin around the old city
4696375 but who can remain unmoved by the important addition to the study of jerusalems past that is now being revealed by the city of david digs
4696376 were not educated to be reflexive at all in archaeology
4696377 i was brought up as an archaeologist making a complete hermetic distinction between science and everyday life i was always politically active but i never thought politics had any relation to scientific work
4696378 is that archaeologists are na ve children in their political perception they just dont want to know they want to dig in the ground get their hands dirty find nice stuff and it really is too great a mental exertion to think about what the impact is of what theyre doing on society
4696379 the minute you say that jerusalem is occupied territory that is political i am forbidden from making political calculations i do purely professional work we have to leave these matters to the decision makers archaeology does not belong to the archaeologists
4696380 when you look at all these cultures together in the ground theyre less threatening you say ok there were a hundred cultures here so another one lives right next to us
4696381 i dont think archaeology is important enough to create conflict over in other words if archaeology is going to lead people into direct conflict that can lead to bloodshed its not worth it i prefer to cover up the site and wait for better times if they ever come
4696382 put an end at once to this blatant perversion and dangerous politicization of an academic field of endeavor
4696383 throwing stones is easy but to carry a pen is very difficult throwing stones thats what the occupation wants us to do but if all we do is throw stones for ten twenty years then what will we have
4696384 dont know each other they hate each other they suspect each other
4696385 a place for everyone where everyone can meet a place where children can feel themselves human beings
4696386 when you really want something all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it
4696387 la igualdad social nunca se podr dar es solo una utop a no existe ni existir ya que siempre habr maldad es el instinto del hombre buscar poder y sentirse mejor que el otro
4696388 a series of events the shooting of a bound palestinian protester two military police probes and as of tuesday the suspension of a battalion commander show a worrying and dangerous downward spiral
4696389 these happenings are taking place under increased scrutiny by the international media
4696390 encourages the opponents of the fence to ratchet up the conflict and a pparently it also increases pressure on idf officers who are having difficulty keeping events in check
4696391 my greatest concern is that the idf will lose its humanity because of the continued fighting
4696392 i was thrown on the ground and noticed only the stalks of my flowers were left everything was still and quiet and when i got up there were people naked not saying anything some of them had no skin or hair i was certain i was dead
4696393 air supremacy over japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
4696394 no effort was made and none was seriously considered to achieve surrender merely in order not to have to use the bomb
4696395 to browbeat the russians with the bomb held rather ostentatiously on our hip
4696396 there was never any illusion on my part that russia was our enemy and that the project was conducted on that basis
4696397 a self righteous one way legal moral screen with positive images of western values and innocence portrayed as threatened validating a campaign of unrestricted violence
4696398 penyerapan anggaran apbn 2008 baru 30 ini masih sedikit melihat masa pemerintahan sby dan jk tinggal 4 bulan kalau target anggaran 90 berarti ada 60 anggaran yang harus terserap dalam waktu 4 bulan ke depan
4696399 saya yakin sisa penyerapan anggaran bisa terserap semuanya kendati dalam wakatu 4 bulan banyak agenda nasional yang memakan aktifitas pemerintah salah satunya hari raya keagamaan
4696400 masa pemerintahan terdahulu juga sama seperti sekarang meski waktu singkat tapi penyerapan anggaran bisa selesaikan target
4696401 among those who have been refused entry for no apparent reason are 3 individuals in the film industry none of the individuals understands why she has been denied entry all three had legitimate plans to begin or complete film projects with palestinians or to meet with palestinians in the film industry the work of these three women is strictly cultural one of the three also has an aged ailing mother in the west bank norma below which is decidedly a humanitarian concern that should work in favor of her being allowed to enter all have continued their efforts to enter the occupied palestinian territory to no avail
4696402 the demolition of houses as punishment is a grave breach of international humanitarian law the declared objective of this policy is to harm innocent persons relatives of suspected perpetrators who are not accused of any criminal wrongdoing themselves the demolition of houses is a clear case of collective punishment which violates the principle that a person is not to be punished for the acts of another collective punishment is therefore illegal regardless of its effectiveness
4696403 regarding effectiveness a committee appointed by former chief of staff moshe yaalon found that the house demolition policy did more harm than good to israels security the committees finding undermines the claim that israel has used for many years that the policy deters potential terrorists
4696404 not to sacrifice justice and morality on the altar of revenge
4696405 the individual examination of the circumstances of each incident must be carried out by the shin bet and the army in coordination with the justice ministry as is customary
4696406 this is an attack which came from within israel into israel it creates a string of scenarios we never thought we would have to deal with in the past we have invested thousands in the construction of a security fence while it has been very effective it turns out that a fence cannot give us the answer to the problem of terror which comes from our side
4696407 i think we need to be tougher in some of the means we use against perpetrators of terror
4696408 if we have to destroy houses then we must do so and if we have to stop their social benefits then we must do so there cannot be a case where they massacre us and at the same time they get all the privileges that our society provides
4696409 one of the main reasons that the attack was carried out yesterday with such ease was because there are palestinian villages that for some reason are called jerusalem jabel mukaber and zur baher they need to be treated as we treat ramallah bethlehem jenin and nablus
4696410 these are palestinian villages that were never part of jerusalem they were annexed to the city in 1967 no israeli has ever been there and doesnt go near there
4696411 if the separation fence was west of the two villages which we all call jerusalem it would have been a lot harder to carry out these kinds of attacks its forbidden for residents of the neighborhoods to have israeli identification cards how many more israelis will have to pay with their lives until this is carried out
4696412 i doubt that demolishing the house will achieve what it aims to achieve though if possible the house must be razed the laws must be made to fit the policy and we mustnt give up
4696413 what we are permitted to do we must do as soon as possible
4696414 judit druks the companion of the late shimon tzabar gave her willingconsent to circulating that excerpt in conjunction with your piece on thesame subject i am sure she would be delighted if you use it as would i
4696415 discern in the old structures the many textures and architectural forms of earlier occupants from the christian crusades to the turkish empire
4696416 our central clothing warehouse was adorned with a number of mahogany closets from the abandoned property
4696417 thus we gradually equipped ourselves with a minimum of comfort
4696418 they came at night to steal fruit from the orchards and go back to gaza laden with loot we guarded the area of the kibbutz from them we would catch prisoners bring them back to the kibbutz and the army picked them up every morning and paid us inside the kibbutz there was a kind of jail a small tin shack where they would keep the prisoners until the army took them
4696419 the facts show that men women old people and babies were murdered villages were destroyed and burned down with no justification
4696420 i am thinking about the abandoned village sasa that we entered this morning with pride and energy and about the lives of the arabs who lived here
4696421 to deprive people of humane medical care you know people die because of that
4696422 the checkpoints are supposedly for security purposes but anyone who wants to perpetrate an attack can pay nis 10 for a taxi and travel by bypass roads or walk through the hills the real purpose is to make life hard for the inhabitants the civilian population suffers
4696423 on the top of every hill on gerizim and ebal is an israeli army outpost that is watching us
4696424 dont throw paper into the toilet bowl because we have a water shortage
4696425 we came here lacking in knowledge and are thirsty to know we are shocked by what we have seen until now it is very clear to us that the situation here is intolerable
4696426 the israeli soldiers are cowards that is why they created routes of movement with bulldozers in doing so they killed three generations of one family the shubi family with the bulldozers
4696427 it is hard for me to describe what i am feeling what i see here is worse than what we experienced but i am encouraged to find that there are courageous people here we want to support you in your struggle by every possible means there are quite a few jews in our delegation and we are very proud that they are the ones who brought us here they are demonstrating their commitment to support you in our country we were able to unite all the forces behind one struggle and there were courageous whites including jews who joined the struggle i hope we will see more israeli jews joining your struggle
4696428 the absolute control of peoples lives the lack of freedom of movement the army presence everywhere the total separation and the extensive destruction we saw
4696429 talk about the promised land and the chosen people adds a religious dimension to racism which we did not have
4696430 when you observe from afar you know that things are bad but you do not know how bad
4696431 the apartheid regime viewed the blacks as inferior i do not think the israelis see the palestinians as human beings at all
4696432 under apartheid whites and blacks met in certain places the israelis and the palestinians do not meet any longer at all the separation is total it seems to me that the israelis would like the palestinians to disappear there was never anything like that in our case the whites did not want the blacks to disappear i saw the settlers in silwan in east jerusalem people who want to expel other people from their place
4696433 kind of getting bored being in the car so much
4696434 a lookout should be built in green colorbond steel a lookout in the same style as the magnificent grand canyon lookout
4696435 this will not require any tree removal and allow tourists of all ages to safely enjoy the spectacular lookout of the scenic rim
4696436 the lamington plateau remains one of australias seven most superb natural wonders
4696437 there is some urgent need for lateral thinking with the lookout sites
4696438 if it could be done at a reasonable cost out of glass then all the better otherwise green colorbond to match the landscape
4696439 its an interesting idea and well certainly have a look at what mr fischer is proposing
4696440 cara voc viu o que o phelps fez ele foi l e ganhou por um cent simo voc vai ganhar por um cent simo ou vai perder por um cent simo ent o vai l e bate na parede
4696441 he lost his eyes and hands to the bomb that hit his house after sunday dinner
4696442 the united states must be thinking he is osama if he is not osama then why would they do this
4696443 every day he reports from a war zone where he is also a prisoner his homeland gaza is surrounded starved attacked forgotten he is a profoundly humane witness to one of the great injustices of our time he is the voice of the voiceless
4696444 he is a moderating voice urging palestinian youth not to court hatred but seek peace with israel
4696445 he was after the award stipend for the martha gellhorn prize
4696446 as they ridiculed me they took delight most in mocking letters i had received from readers in england i had now been without food and water and the toilet for 12 hours and having been made to stand my legs buckled i vomited and passed out all i remember is one of them gouging scraping and clawing with his nails at the tender flesh beneath my eyes he scooped my head and dug his fingers in near the auditory nerves between my head and eardrum the pain became sharper as he dug in two fingers at a time another man had his combat boot on my neck pressing into the hard floor i lay there for over an hour the room became a menagerie of pain sound and terror
4696447 beatings painful binding back bending body stretching and prolonged sleep deprivation
4696448 this is by no means an isolated incident but part of a long term strategy to demolish palestinian social economic and cultural life i am aware of the possibility that mohammed omer might be murdered by israeli snipers or bomb attack in the near future
4696449 dont even think of coming home late come back right away so you can prepare for your next exam
4696450 there are a lot of soldiers here the police stopped the bus we dont know why and were in jerusalem the soldier is asking us not to talk on the phone ill call back later
4696451 we are now in the israeli police station theyve detained everyone from the bus they are checking us all and i am not allowed to talk to you now and theyll let us go soon
4696452 go up to the solider and tell him you have to talk to my father he does not know where i am
4696453 if your father wants to see you tell him to come here
4696454 you murderers where is my son do you want to kill him as you killed his sister a year ago
4696455 dad dont be afraid i am okay they are going to let us go in a bit like they said ill talk with you soon
4696456 anyone who moves his head ill put a bullet in it
4696457 at that moment all i could think of was abir who really was shot in the head by a bullet
4696458 how can they ask the men to undress in front of the women they dont have morals
4696459 do you think they perhaps have at least some basic morals
4696460 they cursed us with all the ugly expressions and slurs they could think of one of them said that all arabs are trash they are racist
4696461 some of them are but not every jewish israeli is like that there are a few who arent affected by this racism but nevertheless it colors israeli society its no wonder that the united nations determined that zionism was a racist movement over 30 years ago
4696462 i wish that you had been there with us dad im sure you would have taught them a lesson and spared all of us that indignity you would have spoken to them in hebrew and made them understand that they were wrong like you always do with soldiers at checkpoints like when that soldier yelled at us at the wad al nar checkpoint when we were going to visit the galilee then you spoke with him and he ended up apologizing to you and wishing that we could all live together in peace
4696463 i want you to take me with you when you go to one of your lectures in israel so i can tell the israelis about the practices of their soldiers on that night
4696464 they have to know what happened so the parents of those soldiers can forbid their children to act that way towards women and children again
4696465 did they apologize to you when they finally let you go
4696466 some of the brass are arguing that part of the operation was not sufficiently justified
4696467 has received legal authorization to confiscate income producing assets of hamas affiliated groups even if no clear link between the groups and terrorist activity has been proven
4696468 the activity in nablus seemed to some to have gone too far one senior official said he was concerned that the campaign would be seen as war against islam instead of a focused struggle against hamas and its terror activities
4696469 had he admitted he belonged to hamas we might believe him but since he denies everything we cannot believe a word hes saying and therefore suspect he is involved in military activity
4696470 upon the petitioners permission we examined the secret files and found that we have no reason to interfere with the decision the petitioner is a hamas activist who was involved in organizing a military activity that is dangerous for the area and as a result of this threat his appeal is denied
4696471 we are not limited in time because the accused is not in custody with regards to the present case
4696472 this is our home we were born here we know of no other place
4696473 however we do not have to identify the characteristics of south african apartheid in the civil rights discrimination in israel in order to call israel an apartheid state the amendment to the citizenship law is exactly the kind of practice that leads to the use of such a term and it is best that we not try to evade the truth its existence in the law books turns israel into an apartheid state
4696474 i swore in the name of allah at the federal territory mosque this evening in accordance to the teachings of islam and as advised by religious scholars and teachers that i was sodomised by anwar ibrahim
4696475 at 2 30pm on wednesday 25 june 2008 senior assistant commissioner sac ii mohd rodwan mohd yusof met mohd saiful bukhari azlan in room 619 of the concorde hotel in kuala lumpur prior to this secret meeting rodwan and saiful spoke on the phone at least eight 8 times
4696476 the oath ive taken was done voluntarily and it was done to uphold the truth as a muslim a malay and a malaysian
4696477 i understand that if the allegations and oath that ive taken under the name of allah are not true i will be cursed by god and tragedy and curse will come upon my family and the generations after me forever
4696478 ive taken this oath to prove that my allegations are completely true this is the best way for me to attain justice in the world and the hereafter and for me to redeem my pride and dignity as allah is the only place where i can complain to
4696479 ive done this for god and i took my oath in the house of god that i was humiliated and sodomised by anwar ibrahim and i do not wish to lie to the world as he has done
4696480 the deal mediated by egypt has been violated by dissident palestinian groups that have fired rockets or mortar shells at israel
4696481 is a tool of arab propaganda used to undermine the legitimacy of the establishment of the state of israel and it must not be part of the lexicon of the un
4696482 israels effort to ban the use of the word nakba at the un is an act of desperation they are obviously incredibly threatened by the precariousness of their international standing so we should view this attempt as a victory for us in our efforts to delegitimize its policies
4696483 the outbreak of war is received with a great deal more sympathy and understanding not to say enthusiasm than a cease fire
4696484 when the all clear is sounded we are all worried that says something about societys sick face quiet is muck war is the most important thing
4696485 a palestinian government of national unity a real and not virtual partner the representative of the entire palestinian people and not half of it an agreement that will not be an agreement of puppets
4696486 you want calm in the west bank please fire qassams at kfar sava too
4696487 the finding was focussed on undermining irans nuclear ambitions and trying to undermine the government through regime change
4696488 well create generations of jihadists and our grandchildren will be battling our enemies here in america
4696489 at least ten senior flag and general officers including combatant commanders
4696490 attacking them as a means to get to that spot strikes me as being not the first choice
4696491 too many people believe you have to be either for or against the iranians
4696492 lets get serious eighty million people live there and everyones an individual the idea that theyre only one way or another is nonsense
4696493 did i bitch about some of the things that were being proposed you bet some of them were very stupid
4696494 the process is broken and this is dangerous stuff were authorizing
4696495 the c i a needed the finding to do its traditional stuff but the finding does not apply to jsoc the president signed an executive order after september 11th giving the pentagon license to do things that it had never been able to do before without notifying congress the claim was that the military was preparing the battle space and by using that term they were able to circumvent congressional oversight everything is justified in terms of fighting the global war on terror
4696496 the administration has been fuzzing the lines there used to be a shade of gray
4696497 the agency says were not going to get in the position of helping to kill people without a finding
4696498 the over all authorization includes killing but its not as though thats what theyre setting out to do its about gathering information enlisting support
4696499 the executive branch understands that we are not trying to dictate what they do
4696500 we are simply trying to see to it that what they do is consistent with american values and will not get the country in trouble
4696501 i suspect theres something going on but i dont know what to believe cheney has always wanted to go after iran and if he had more time hed find a way to do it we still dont get enough information from the agencies and i have very little confidence that they give us information on the edge
4696502 is just that notification and not a sign off on activities proper oversight of ongoing intelligence activities is done by fully briefing the members of the intelligence committee
4696503 as a rule we dont comment one way or the other on allegations of covert activities or purported findings
4696504 it will take another year before we get the intelligence activities under control
4696505 we control the money and they cant do anything without the money money is what its all about but im very leery of this administration
4696506 theyve been absolutely unhelpful very damaging and i absolutely dont condone any of their activities and i have yet to see anything since ive been in this job in the way of a public action by iran thats been at all helpful in this region
4696507 when i arrived at centcom the iranians were funding every entity inside iraq it was in their interest to get us out and so they decided to kill as many americans as they could and why not they didnt know whod come out ahead but they wanted us out i decided that i couldnt resolve the situation in iraq without the neighborhood to get this problem in iraq solved we had to somehow involve iran and syria i had to work the neighborhood
4696508 it would happen only if the iranians did something stupid
4696509 one of the reasons the white house selected fallon for centcom was that hes known to be a strategic thinker and had demonstrated those skills in the pacific
4696510 he was charged with coming up with an over all coherent strategy for iran iraq and afghanistan and by law the combatant commander is responsible for all military
4696511 when fallon tried to make sense of all the overt and covert activity conducted by the military in his area of responsibility a small group in the white house leadership shut him out
4696512 the coherence of military strategy is being eroded because of undue civilian influence and direction of nonconventional military operations
4696513 if you have small groups planning and conducting military operations outside the knowledge and control of the combatant commander by default you cant have a coherent military strategy you end up with a disaster like the reconstruction efforts in iraq
4696514 fox said that theres a lot of strange stuff going on in special ops and i told him he had to figure out what they were really doing
4696515 the special ops guys eventually figured out they needed fox and so they began to talk to him fox would have won his fight with special ops but for cheney
4696516 fallon went down because in his own way he was trying to prevent a war with iran and you have to admire him for that
4696517 is very open in describing the killings going on inside the country
4696518 a controlled press which makes it more important that it publishes these things we begin to see inside the government
4696519 hardly a day goes by now we dont see a clash somewhere there were three or four incidents over a recent weekend and the iranians are even naming the revolutionary guard officers who have been killed
4696520 this is the ultimate for the iranians to blame the c i a
4696521 this is new and its an escalation a ratcheting up of tensions it rallies
4696522 in gardiners view the violence rather than weakening irans religious government may generate support for it
4696523 weve got exposure because of the transfer of our weapons and our communications gear the iranians will be able to make the argument that the opposition was inspired by the americans how many times have we tried this without asking the right questions is the risk worth it
4696524 just because lebanon iraq and pakistan have ethnic problems it does not mean that iran is suffering from the same issue
4696525 iran is an old country like france and germany and its citizens are just as nationalistic the u s is overestimating ethnic tension in iran
4696526 you can always find some activist groups that will go and kill a policeman but working with the minorities will backfire and alienate the majority of the population
4696527 the baluchis are sunni fundamentalists who hate the regime in tehran but you can also describe them as al qaeda
4696528 these are guys who cut off the heads of nonbelievers in this case its shiite iranians the irony is that were once again working with sunni fundamentalists just as we did in afghanistan in the nineteen eighties
4696529 this is a vicious salafi organization whose followers attended the same madrassas as the taliban and pakistani extremists
4696530 they are suspected of having links to al qaeda and they are also thought to be tied to the drug culture
4696531 the new task force will work with the m e k the administration is desperate for results
4696532 the m e k has no c p a auditing the books and its leaders are thought to have been lining their pockets for years if people only knew what the m e k is getting and how much is going to its bank accounts and yet it is almost useless for the purposes the administration intends
4696533 malikis increasingly choosing the interests of iraq over the interests of the united states
4696534 seem to be harming relations with the governments of both iraq and pakistan and could well be strengthening the connection between tehran and baghdad
4696535 the program works because its small and smart guys are running it
4696536 we have to be really careful in calling in the missiles we have to hit certain houses at certain times the people on the ground are watching through binoculars a few hundred yards away and calling specific locations in latitude and longitude we keep the predator loitering until the targets go into a house and we have to make sure our guys are far enough away so they dont get hit
4696537 the special ops guys are pissed off because cheneys office set up priorities for categories of targets and now hes getting impatient and applying pressure for results but it takes a long time to get the right guys in place
4696538 weve had wonderful results in the horn of africa with the use of surrogates and false flags basic counterintelligence and counter insurgency tactics and were beginning to tie them in knots in afghanistan but the white house is going to kill the program if they use it to go after iran its one thing to engage in selective strikes and assassinations in waziristan and another in iran the white house believes that one size fits all but the legal issues surrounding extrajudicial killings in waziristan are less of a problem because al qaeda and the taliban cross the border into afghanistan and back again often with u s and nato forces in hot pursuit the situation is not nearly as clear in the iranian case all the considerations judicial strategic and political are different in iran
4696539 there is huge opposition inside the intelligence community to the idea of waging a covert war inside iran and using baluchis and ahwazis as surrogates the leaders of our special operations community all have remarkable physical courage but they are less likely to voice their opposition to policy iran is not waziristan
4696540 yes its more serious than we have seen but to put it in context we do interact with the iranian revolutionary guard and their navy regularly
4696541 i didnt get the sense from the reports i was receiving that there was a sense of being afraid of these five boats
4696542 the subject was how to create a casus belli between tehran and washington
4696543 be possible to freeze the iranian nuclear program for the duration of the negotiations to avoid a military confrontation before they are completed should this newest attempt fail things will soon get serious deadly serious
4696544 the proposal says that the iranians must stop manufacturing new centrifuges and the other side will stop all further sanction activities in the u n security council
4696545 this could be acceptable to the iranians if they have good will
4696546 i think the americans are deeply divided on the issue of what to do about iran
4696547 some officials are concerned about the fallout from a military attack and others think an attack is unavoidable i know the europeans but i have no idea where the americans will end up on this issue
4696548 theres no doubt that this is set to be the biggest season of my career in football
4696549 i didnt manage to play top flight football so far ive been an assistant manager and a first team coach in the premier league
4696550 but to manage in the premier league has always been an ambition of mine im about to realise that dream
4696551 most teams prefer to stay away from newly promoted teams in the early part of the season because they often start like a house on fire
4696552 i cant say it is a draw we would have chosen but you play every team twice
4696553 hull might not be one of the teams tipped for the top but we are aware they will be firing on all cylinders
4696554 theres no surer way to turn new female fans into former female fans than by complaining about how hard it is to keep on weight
4696555 i just ran the first 50 meters then i looked around to make sure i was safe and i shut it off
4696556 its definitely going to be the most exciting final weve had in a very long time in the mens 100
4696557 theres no surer way to turn new female fans into former female fans than by complaining about how hard it is to keep on weight
4696558 yeah i made that play i know what ur doing on the d ur so predictable
4696559 a metaphor for the loss of eden for the sorrows of dispossession and exile for the declining power of the arab world in its dealings with the west
4696560 against barbarity poetry can resist only by confirming its attachment to human fragility like a blade of grass growing on a wall while armies march by
4696561 i thought poetry could change everything could change history and could humanize and i think that the illusion is very necessary to push poets to be involved and to believe
4696562 but now i think that poetry changes only the poet
4696563 i am still not a poet and sometimes i regret i chose this way
4696564 i was very strongly influenced by al mutanabbi and the mahjar poets emigrant poets such a kahlil gibran and modern arab poets such as qabbani al sayyab
4696565 garcia lorca pablo neruda yeats and today derek walcott is probably my favorite poet i also like the polish poets especially symborska
4696566 i do not like the label it is a burden
4696567 although i might realize that the harshest exile is in my homeland
4696568 we should not justify suicide bombers we are against the suicide bombers but we must understand what drives these young people to such actions they want to liberate themselves from such a dark life it is not ideological it is despair
4696569 give us back our house but live in our garden in our living room
4696570 the palestinian people feel that they are living the hours before dawn their national will is stronger in reaction to the challenge they do not have another option but to continue to carry the hope that they are going to have a normal life

4696576 now with mainsofts net extensions customers can easily leverage any existing net development skills and applications
4696577 we also wanted to avoid the cost and time it would normally require to build new security and branding every time we brought on a new customer
4696578 because we could deliver a highly scalable personalized experience in a proven production environment and with net extensions the development experience was highly intuitive
4696579 our c developers were developing java portlets on day one of a two day training with mainsoft consultants as a result the efulfillment site went into production only five months after we started development work we estimate that the site will pay for itself in reduced mailing and administrative costs within a year and better serve our members

4696581 the old saying is that when you get in the gutter everybody gets dirty
4696582 but its important for obama to portray corsi as a demented right wing loon
4696583 a discredited liar who is peddling another piece of garbage in order to continue the bush cheney politics he helped perpetuate four years ago
4696584 the book is designed to say that i oppose the candidacy of barack obama and i explain why ive got 360 pages and nearly 700 footnotes explaining my argumentation about obama and a complete examination of his life his positions his background
4696585 you say how can anyone impugn my reputation like this
4696586 reminding people of negative information isnt usually helpful you can give credibility to it even though youre saying its wrong
4696587 these creditors certainly their counsel have to know that they will never collect so much as 35 from mike nifong
4696588 we suggest this is nothing more than hyperbolic pleading unworthy of belief without considerable more specificity

4696590 this is not a question of 35 or 35 cents

4696592 it indicates to us that our fundraising continues to be very healthy
4696593 so well be spending much more than weve been raising
4696594 an uptick in internet receipts that continues to this day

4696597 this is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it
4696598 i dont think theres anything more unseemly than the sight of a rock star in academic robes its a bit like when people put their king charles spaniels in little tartan sweats and hats its not natural and it doesnt make the dog any smarter
4696599 what happens is the water tunnels to the bottom and makes the ice like swiss cheese sort of like termites

4696610 there was a ramp that went over the rubble my son brendan and i were able to come here and all the world stops when we had whole bodies or something that would resemble a whole body and people would line up on each side of this makeshift ramp and i went down with my son brendan and we were able to collect jonathan he was already in a basket and ive got to stop for a second so we were able to go down spend a little time and then brendan and myself and some of the guys in jons company we carried him up put him in an ambulance and took jon away we were blessed in a way because my son was a whole body
4696611 north pole may be ice free for first time this summer
4696612 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
4696613 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
4696614 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
4696615 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
4696616 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
4696617 he may be angry because we have hidden his tools
4696618 theres a massive interest and knowledge in the comicbook industry and it takes time to sort of catch up and understand the characters and the history where theyve intersected with each other and what their worlds are thats part of the education that were going through
4696619 so when you make them into a movie youd better be shooting for a pretty high standard youre not always going to reach it but you have to be shooting for it were going to make a justice league movie whether its now or 10 years from now but were not going to do it and warners is not going to do it until we know its right
4696620 if you do it wrong youre dead youre out of there
4696621 we havent committed to any change at dc at this point
4696622 the properties into viable movie product in an intelligent way so that we introduce them like planes on a runway they have to be set up the right way and lined up the right way and all take off one at a time and fly safe and fly straight
4696623 i dont know the key to success but the key to failure is trying to please everybody
4696624 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
4696625 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
4696626 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
4696627 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
4696628 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
4696629 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4696630 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
4696631 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
4696632 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
4696633 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
4696634 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
4696635 once again we have an opportunity to take a giant leap for humankind
4696636 when we send money to foreign countries to buy nearly 70 percent of the oil we use every day they build new skyscrapers and we lose jobs when we spend that money building solar arrays and windmills we build competitive industries and gain jobs here at home
4696637 i have long supported a sharp reduction in payroll taxes with the difference made up in co2 taxes we should tax what we burn not what we earn this is the single most important policy change we can make
4696638 we must recognize those who have toiled in dangerous conditions to bring us our present energy supply we should guarantee good jobs in the fresh air and sunshine for any coal miner displaced by impacts on the coal industry
4696639 in recent years our politics has tended toward incremental proposals made up of small policies designed to avoid offending special interests alternating with occasional baby steps in the right direction our democracy has become sclerotic at a time when these crises require boldness
4696640 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
4696641 more than any time in history mankind faces a crossroads one path leads to despair and utter hopelessness the other to total extinction let us pray that we have the wisdom to choose correctly
4696642 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4696643 says he has all the answers and it will only cost 3 trillion
4696644 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
4696645 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
4696646 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
4696647 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
4696648 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
4696649 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
4696650 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
4696651 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
4696652 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4696653 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4696654 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4696655 but fluoride is in my tooth paste and it helps my teeth
4696656 thats so f ken funny lol k ke dar it po p
4696657 a great slideshows is determined by the type of interaction a presenter has with their slides
4696658 if the presenter is addicted to reading bullet points then everyone in the room suffers
4696659 we can keep blaming software for the putrid output but in reality we need to take responsibility
4696660 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure
4696661 still there are a few high profile names outstanding al gores most of all though a democratic involved in planning
4696662 i wont accept it because i cant accept it because i dont what else ill do if this fails
4696663 i will fight tooth and nail against anyone who tries to make me accept it because i will be too lost if this doesnt happen
4696664 okay im not going to be president but how about vice president or something so i dont have to face having nothing
4696665 its all real its not a bad dream i am lost and dont feel like doing anything else everybody just leave me alone
4696666 okay i guess i dont have nothing i still have my family i still have people who believed in me i still have a job in the senate i can still make a difference
4696667 my core value and life has been to be of service my daddy did and so have i for most of my adult life i like being an educator on the problems of global warming but i may actually have more leverage to help that and other initiatives as president and besides i will agree if elected to only serve one term where one of my most important roles is to mentor barack obama to be the real president who makes change happen after i leave office in 2012
4696668 christopher doesnt see women for what they should be he sees women for who they can be
4696669 what do you want your look to say to people
4696670 62 of all americans are part of a wireless mobile population that participates in digital activities away from home or work
4696671 gender stereotypes trump race stereotypes in every social science test
4696672 the deal is that women generally fall into two alternatives they are seen as either nice but stupid or smart but mean
4696673 contact doesnt undermine these stereotypes and it might even strengthen them
4696674 many people dont believe seeing women as kind or soft is a stereotype theyre not going to question it because they believe its a good thing
4696675 the measure of a civilization is how it treats those who have hurt it
4696676 liberals are more self centered than conservatives conservatives are more generous and charitable than liberals liberals are more envious and less hardworking than conservatives conservatives value truth more than liberals and are less prone to cheating and lying liberals are more angry than conservatives conservatives are actually more knowledgeable than liberals liberals are more dissatisfied and unhappy than conservatives

4696678 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
4696679 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4696680 be a pro online with the friends you may or may not have

4696683 a lookout should be built in green colorbond steel a lookout in the same style as the magnificent grand canyon lookout
4696684 this will not require any tree removal and allow tourists of all ages to safely enjoy the spectacular lookout of the scenic rim
4696685 the lamington plateau remains one of australias seven most superb natural wonders
4696686 there is some urgent need for lateral thinking with the lookout sites
4696687 if it could be done at a reasonable cost out of glass then all the better otherwise green colorbond to match the landscape
4696688 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4696689 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4696690 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4696691 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4696692 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4696693 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4696694 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4696695 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4696696 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4696697 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4696698 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4696699 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4696700 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4696701 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4696702 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4696703 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4696704 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4696705 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4696706 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4696707 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4696708 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4696709 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4696710 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4696711 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4696712 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4696713 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4696714 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4696715 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4696716 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4696717 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4696718 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4696719 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
4696720 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source
4696721 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
4696722 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
4696723 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
4696724 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
4696725 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
4696726 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
4696727 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
4696728 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
4696729 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
4696730 i was close last time and i kept looking at the rankings so im trying to forget about it
4696731 i would love to play in it but im just trying to play well here and if i play well it will take care of itself its not like ive done anything spectacular this year but a win here would be nice
4696732 i could have played a safe third shot pitch out to about 15 feet but i had momentum with me and it wasnt that hard a shot
4696733 i chunked it in the bunker and then didnt get up and down but it was nice to come back with birdies on 16 and 17 to end the round on a good note

4696739 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
4696740 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder
4696741 what we think is we need to have a real debate about the issue and that includes a real look at the costs of some of the policies being promoted
4696742 lets look at taking whatever revenue is derived from that and devote it entirely to tax relief
4696743 we think that there are solutions to whatever the climate crisis may be that are market based that dont involve increasing the size of government substantially
4696744 do we want to create a model where the solutions for dependence on oil come out of europe or asia and were sitting here in the u s because we want to argue for the status quo
4696745 the scientific data show the change is accelerating so when you do take measures the longer you delay the more aggressive those measures have to be
4696746 its important to address those issues sooner rather than later
4696747 if the united states congress would have the backbone enough to announce to this world that we are going to deregulate and we are going to begin to drill and refine american oil we would begin to see gas prices plummet
4696748 a full portfolio of resources can ease the energy crunch

4696764 the more liberal camp just assumes that pastor warren is going to make this a christian litmus test of the presidency others who are more conservative fear he is going to wimp out on some of the issues

4696767 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4696768 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4696769 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4696770 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula

4696779 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
4696780 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
4696781 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
4696782 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
4696783 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
4696784 just so you all know we did set a record
4696785 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
4696786 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4696787 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
4696788 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
4696789 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs

4696793 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
4696794 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain

4696802 i feel rex has made improvement like the rest of our ballclub has
4696803 were not ready for the first game yet and you shouldnt be we dont want to necessarily peak yet we have three more games
4696804 but we know we need to make a decision so we can start getting the timing and everything else going
4696805 im excited youre working with the guys who will be playing in the games
4696806 obviously we were a little disappointed in that first drive against k c
4696807 we did run a vanilla defense i think were going to open up our package a little bit more this weekend
4696808 i dont care if you dont like it clean your friggin plate
4696809 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4696810 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4696811 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4696812 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4696813 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4696814 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4696815 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4696816 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4696817 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4696818 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4696819 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4696820 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4696821 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4696822 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4696823 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4696824 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4696825 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4696826 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4696827 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4696828 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4696829 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4696830 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4696831 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4696832 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
4696833 many in the christian right tend to get their information
4696834 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4696835 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4696836 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4696837 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
4696838 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view
4696839 but getting a suitable person with the right qualities and the right experience is the hard part
4696840 it is tough coming in at this stage of the season even for players of the highest quality asking them to come in and make a difference
4696841 with the icc champions trophy and an australian a tour somewhere too a lot of the best players are all taken up so the likelihood is well just go ahead with the good young players weve got coming through
4696842 weve got a group of young bowlers onions and davies plunkett so weve got plenty of those guys
4696843 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
4696844 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
4696845 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
4696846 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4696847 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
4696848 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
4696849 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
4696850 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
4696851 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
4696852 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
4696853 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
4696854 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
4696855 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
4696856 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
4696857 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
4696858 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
4696859 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
4696860 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
4696861 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
4696862 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
4696863 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
4696864 after looking at data and video from the first session we decided to start from scratch
4696865 tomorrow morning for qualifying its going to be a bit cooler but i think well keep the changes we made they improved the overall grip hooverspeed went to town and worked hard in between the sessions and we picked up some time once again hooverspeed and pancreaticcure org have just been awesome
4696866 i expect the guys that played well to continue to improve
4696867 our goal at training camp whether youre talking about practice or certainly the games is to get better every day
4696868 if they played pretty well i was happy for them in the first game but they cant take a deep breath and think theyve arrived theyve got to play better this week were going to have to make some decisions in the next couple weeks and theyve got to show us they belong here
4696869 d d lewis always comes up to me and he just tells me the opportunity that i have and the steps i need to take in order to be successful on this team and in the league
4696870 hes been like a mentor to me off the field keeping me going pushing me
4696871 i see more than just a little bit of myself in david
4696872 youve always got to look out for your texas guys
4696873 hes picking it up naturally hes going out there and working hard and hes asking questions thats what you need to do
4696874 now even if i wanted to go a different way you cant mess around because we have two receivers who are going to be on the roster that might not be playing so youve got to keep those guys
4696875 so you cant really fiddle around with that number too much
4696876 being raised in south seattle we dont get around too many farm animals
4696877 anything that has to do with helping out these animals that have been abused and neglected its a unique opportunity to get involved and i was more than willing to help
4696878 now i can hang the picture up in my house and play it off like i was raised on a farm
4696879 it damages the personal deep part of every one of us that we keep to ourselves
4696880 the note placed between the stones of the western wall are between a person and his maker it is forbidden to read them or make use of them
4696881 forgive me my sins and help me guard against pride and despair give me the wisdom to do what is right and just and make me an instrument of your will
4696882 i sometimes wonder whether ill be able to get a job at all
4696883 are very concerned much more so than they were even just a month ago
4696884 containing inflation is no longer the primary focus of the government rightly or wrongly theyre thinking inflation is yesterdays problem growth and jobs is what they are concerned about
4696885 china lacks the educational infrastructure to keep pace with the frantic demand for education
4696886 the vast majority of chinese kids go to second or third rate schools diploma mills and are just unprepared to enter a very competitive job market theyre getting ripped off
4696887 kids who really shouldnt even be in college go anyway and then expect a good paying job when they graduate
4696888 i look for people who have already worked a lot of colleges arent producing kids with the skills we need there needs to be better communication between companies and educational institutions and it will take time to fix this problem
4696889 one reason i refuse to bother with the whole security circus is that i think it glorifies and thus encourages the wrong behavior it makes heroes out of security people as if the people who dont just fix normal bugs arent as important in fact all the boring normal bugs are way more important just because theres a lot more of them
4696890 mak ing such a big deal about concentrating on security to the point where they pretty much admit that nothing else matters to them
4696891 revels in exposing vendor security holes because they see that as just another proof that the vendors are corrupt and crap which admittedly mostly are
4696892 both camps point fingers at each other as a way to cement their own reason for existence
4696893 you need to fix things early and that requires a certain level of disclosure for the developers
4696894 you also dont need to make a big production out of it
4696895 what does the whole security labeling give you except for more fodder for either of the pr camps that i obviously think are both idiots pushing for their own agenda
4696896 any situation that allows the vendor to sit on the bug for weeks or months is unacceptable as is any situation that makes it harder for people who find problems to talk to technical people
4696897 so the whole embargoes are good mentality is just corruption from the vendors
4696898 but on the other hand disclosure should not be the goal
4696899 have a model where security is easier to do in the first place that is the unix model but make it easy for people to report bugs with no embargo but privately
4696900 even then i will forward it to technical people on an as needed basis because even that embargo secrecy is not some insane absolute thing
4696901 proceed from the assumption that to be respected we have to use brute military force
4696902 could not find adequate proof that early detection leads to fewer men dying of the disease
4696903 the more videos they watched the fewer words they knew
4696904 these babies scored about 10 lower on language skills than infants who had not watched these videos
4696905 they dont get that interaction from watching tv or videos in fact the watching probably interferes with the crucial wiring being laid down in their brains during early development
4696906 even watching a live person speak to you via television is not the same thing as having that person in front of you
4696907 the majority of the videos dont try to promote language they have rapid scene changes and quick edits and no appearance of the parent ese type of speaking that parents use when talking to their babies
4696908 there is an assumption that stimulation is good so more is better
4696909 but thats not true there is such a thing as overstimulation
4696910 their minds come to expect a high level of stimulation and view that as normal
4696911 russia warned that there would be repercussions for kosovo and here they are
4696912 the russians are looking for an excuse to kill georgians
4696913 saakashvili got too close to the u s and the u s got too close to saakashvili
4696914 the blood of our children is the responsibility of bush and saakashvili
4696915 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4696916 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4696917 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4696918 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
4696919 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
4696920 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
4696921 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4696922 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4696923 pour nous cette approche na pas de sens en tant que loi ou r glement
4696924 nous sommes persuad s que le succ s dun logiciel l chelle de windows passe par l tablissement dune tribune libre ouverte et honn te o nous pourrons discuter de la fa on dont nous mitigeons sic tous ces int r ts ce blog repr sente la fois la promesse et le point de d part dun tel dialogue
4696925 de ne parler daucunes fonctionnalit pour laquelle nous naurions pas atteint un degr suffisant de certitude
4696926 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
4696927 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
4696928 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
4696929 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
4696930 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
4696931 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
4696932 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
4696933 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
4696934 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
4696935 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
4696936 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
4696937 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
4696938 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
4696939 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
4696940 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
4696941 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
4696942 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
4696943 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
4696944 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
4696945 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
4696946 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
4696947 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
4696948 bird is here you know in my mind already and i am singing with the bird
4696949 when you are not disturbed by the blue jay you know the blue jay will come right into your heart and you will be a blue jay and blue jay will be reading something
4696950 most of us have far more courage than we ever dreamed we possessed
4696951 i am a leader in my class this is my responsibility i am a hall monitor
4696952 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4696953 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4696954 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4696955 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4696956 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4696957 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4696958 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4696959 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4696960 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4696961 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4696962 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4696963 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4696964 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4696965 wir erlauben es dir mit den web seiten fotos videos und der musik auf dem neuesten stand zu bleiben die deine freunde und deine familie mit der welt teilen
4696966 vor meinem letzten zug habe ich gedacht dass ich das rennen verloren habe und es vorbei ist

4696969 but the fact remains they are untested and we have doubts whether pakistan could deliver on those plans
4696970 getting eight teams around to training and games in two centres is a massive logistical exercise and with the current situation there i dont know if the military could handle it
4696971 natural gas prices have been falling but the big question is whether they will continue to do so
4696972 the market is so volatile a hurricane in the gulf of mexico or a terrorist attack somewhere could turn things around pretty quickly
4696973 a month ago no one was anticipating the price was going to go down
4696974 that really isnt of much concern though storage may be a little behind but there still is plenty of time to catch up
4696975 russland hat wieder sein wahres gesicht gezeigt so wie wir es seit jahrhunderten kennen
4696976 es lohnt sich f r die freiheit zu k mpfen
4696977 estoy en la final que es lo importante un poco decepcionado pero bien pens encontrarme un poco mejor ahora tengo tres d as para organizar mis esquemas y sensaciones me falt ritmo solamente eso tendr que hacer un par de ajustes
4696978 me relaj despu s de ver que casi lo hice en el primero que estaba casi seguro en la final
4696979 i was starting to hurt a little bit with probably the last 10 meters
4696980 that was my last individual race so i was just trying to finish as strong as i could
4696981 and im old enough to be able to handle it
4696982 i wouldnt have come back if i wasnt ready to come back

4696987 ive sent a message to their centre where theyre collected its accuracy is great its amazing
4696988 feats of prowess and agility were meant to please zeus who picked the most worthy athlete to be the victor
4696989 conspicuous and popular aspect at pagan festivals attracting tens of thousands of people
4696990 when he called me and asked me to put the band together he said ive done nothin but movies for nine years and i dont wanna do any more movies i wanna go out and play live i wanna get my audience in front of me and i wanna go out and be there for the fans he loved the excitement from the fans of people that loved him it was just him what he loves
4696991 like many people my age yknow i was quite young i was always interested in music and i was listening to what we all would refer to as our parents music so when my older brother brought home the single of heartbreak hotel its not a unique story but it was just a mind blowing revelation in terms of this kind of explosive spirit that just kind of washed over that whole generation
4696992 elvis presley is probably the babe ruth of the whole thing chuck berry little richard invented rock n roll elvis exposed us to it theres no doubt about that he brought it into our living rooms he brought it on tv he was the guy that really you know woke us up wow here was the not arguably one of the great natural performers of all time and great singing as well he was so great people didnt know what to think of him
4696993 thats a terrible tragedy when you think what a decent kind of guy he seemed to be when you read the stuff you know he came to pieces at the end and its easy to blame vegas but it wasnt about vegas it was just about the load
4696994 as to the reasons for the continuing fascination with elvis i think to some extent youve got to understand that theres been a proliferation of media in the years of his lifetime and since his death i mean elvis grew up with television or at least television grew up with elviss rise to fame but i think the thing that will continue elvis long after the media attention has faded long after this kind of frenzy of fame is gone the thing that will continue peoples interest in him is his music
4696995 what are the pros cons of a drum riser in this room and what exactly is the main purpose of one
4696996 when youre playing in front of 50 family members and everybody is expecting something its kind of like a playoff atmosphere almost
4696997 he snyder told me he had some friends sitting behind home plate watching the game for some reason i really wanted to hit a home run
4696998 i didnt have location its very difficult for me if i cant throw the ball where i want to
4696999 so we got through the second and we thought ok here we go
4697000 it feels good you cant lie having a night like that in front of family and friends
4697001 coming home is great but thats icing on the cake right there
4697002 there are certainly things that didnt end up the way id have liked them to
4697003 im happy to be here for me ive got plenty of incentive every time i take the field its tough to add to that
4697004 that was disappointing because i think when u look back at these tournaments i deserved to get maybe at least a silver medal so of course thats disappointing but thats wat happens

4697037 the americans have never lost that race since its been an event in the olympic games
4697038 you have to be very cautious on the relay exchanges and make sure nobody gets disqualified but it should be just a matter of what the time is going to be and whos going to put the gold medal around their neck first
4697039 i always wondered what my feelings would be i feel a tremendous load off my back somebody told me years ago you judge ones character by the company you keep and im just happy to be in the company of michael phelps thats the bottom line
4697040 im so proud of what hes been able to do i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark
4697041 our view is that burma is an accident waiting to happen

4697053 he was quite young but he already had a good sense of the event
4697054 he knew all the big jumpers of the time he was very familiar with careers of charles johnson hollis conway dwight stones even and i think that was a big advantage for him he seemed to study the event he had the athletic ability but he also had the brains more than anybody else i coached at that level

4697063 my goal in this race was a bronze and i surpassed that with a silver i can say i was the only guy at this competition to have a real shot at beating phelps one on one
4697064 i had to take off my goggles first to make sure the 1 was next to my name
4697065 thats when i sort of let out my roar i felt relief excitement everything

4697085 i told tony im here to have fun with you and i know he wants to have fun doing this
4697086 that is what racing hasnt been a lot of for me lately just because we had success in 2002 2003 and part of 04 and lately it hasnt been as successful
4697087 therefore some of the fun has been gone with that
4697088 were working not to get just one crew chief but to get a pair of crew chiefs that will work together and help us work together better as drivers
4697089 i am a little nervous and there will be some pressure on me but hopefully we will have a good outcome
4697090 id love to win but if i could get a good finish maybe in the top eight or even the top five i think we would all walk away feeling pretty satisfied
4697091 i had a lot of great up and downs today there were a few holes where it could have gone either way and i just grinded it through im proud of myself for shooting under par today and it sets me up for saturday and sunday
4697092 if i play good everything will take care of itself thats what im going to focus on just playing my round you know its my last tournament so i want to end on a good note hopefully itll be a really good one
4697093 as this thing gets rolling the newness will wear off and it gets down to playing and ill keep saying this im here for one reason and thats to help this team win no other reason
4697094 legs a little bit fatigued youve got to figure im a little bit behind some of these guys
4697095 you just cant go in with a hard number because the game especially in the preseason flows so differently that you dont know how long the defense is going be to out how long the offense is going to be out what the situation is going to be how long theyre going to keep their group out
4697096 so its hard to say its going to be this number hard and fast and thats what we are sticking to but usually youre trying to get 10 or 12 reps
4697097 theres going to be a big crowd out there the excitement thats being created around brett coming to us is giving us a lot of energy throughout camp so itll be fun come today
4697098 the big thing with him is getting comfortable with calling the plays
4697099 again the plays are the same thing but as a quarterback the more you call it the more you can become comfortable with it the more you can actually see the picture of the play in your mind
4697100 you see him in green bay and youre like you never know this guy could be throwing me passes someday and now that hes here its weird hes throwing me passes now and im just trying to make sure i dont make him mad and catch everything he throws my way
4697101 hopefully hell think hes so special that well only have to face him for a series or two
4697102 i wanted another opportunity to get another situation turned around
4697103 theres an entire generation of kids who have no idea smu used to be a good football program
4697104 the courses on the pga tour have been set up hard so its a nice change to be really aggressive and sedgefield kind of suits my style
4697105 i try to play really aggressive all the time and so far its paid off great
4697106 as soon as i did that my mind kind of set in and played nice all day
4697107 every time i made a birdie it seemed like he made one too
4697108 we faced a pretty salty defense out there with a ton of veterans all over the place it felt good to be out there it felt like practice
4697109 in the preseason you just try to get it over as quickly as possible so you can get to the regular season
4697110 im not usually one of the guys who wants to go in but a couple of times i got scared
4697111 it was so tough especially with it being a preseason game
4697112 it was almost like a practice i mean guys take it seriously but we had to take a flight home and we just broke camp so we had a lot on our minds
4697113 every kid dreams of being a gold medalist only one person in the world can actually say they are the current olympic gold medalist im trying to be that one person
4697114 one player has the ball running all over the field with nine receivers and no offensive linemen
4697115 our guys improved every week the last two thirds of the season and in the bowl game they understand game speed now hudson said
4697116 youve got to stop the run and get the ball back said hudson who served on holtzs staff at connecticut then rejoined him at ecu in 2004
4697117 we feel terrible for izzy we have to move on but hes an important part of what weve done
4697118 the guys made a lot of big plays behind me asdrubal cabrera especially ive told him about it four times since the game ended
4697119 its too early to think of those things but cliff has had as good a year as anybody
4697120 it looked like he lost his feel you turn the page on this hell bounce back
4697121 we got so much out of this playing two very good 4 a teams
4697122 mike engles a linebacker and tailback is going to play quarterback greg jones tailback gus goodson and receiver kassun williams also looked good
4697123 going against clayton we knew were going to play a physical well coached team
4697124 terrell hartsfield linebacker and our defensive ends keaton epps and jake kahut played well
4697125 after tuesday we were out of kindergarten now were out of the first grade but i like our attitude
4697126 brandon byars made some good catches and blocked well connor mclaurins done a good job at linebacker and backup tailback jeremiah davis has shown me something
4697127 zach and mark wilder at linebacker came ready to play for us
4697128 the olympics i know theyre the biggest thing in the world
4697129 its great its a chance for me to meet people from all over the world
4697130 whatever minutes i get i have to play 100 percent
4697131 to be in beijing there are a lot of emotions but its very special
4697132 hes in a different situation than we were hes playing in the olympics but out here age doesnt matter hes 17 kidd is 35 it dont matter
4697133 he has some pretty good veteran guys whove made it to where he wants to go so listen to those older guys
4697134 work hard never be satisfied because youll always need to work on your game
4697135 its one dream to go to the nba thats true i have to say the truth its a dream for everybody to play in the best league in the world
4697136 early on he was getting the ball up a little bit but he settled down and made some unbelievable pitches when he had to
4697137 im close its just that the abdominals are tough youve got to be careful with them
4697138 i was trying to bounce a breaking ball and left it over the middle
4697139 im just trying to make good contact there and i crushed the ball
4697140 the first pitch was a fastball then im watching his release on the next pitch and the fastball comes again and i got all of it
4697141 the guys put us in a spot to win the ballgame and i screwed it up in the ninth
4697142 it was a situation when i didnt execute my pitch and he made me pay for it
4697143 i like the way these kids get after it for nine innings
4697144 im happy for the team this has been a difficult place for us
4697145 ive been rushing a little too much and ive been working with the pitching coach on correcting some things in my approach
4697146 playing in the olympics in whats supposed to be considered a gentlemans sport thats a time to call it on yourself
4697147 fernando looked me square in the eye and didnt call it
4697148 watching this in slow motion as i had to do to take these shots i know tough job i realized that there appears to be an extended fight scene in this movie in which statham rips the clothes right off his body to use as weapons i i dont have anything to add to that except my 12 bucks
4697149 what youre saying is is that i could have gone home any time i wanted to so basically no no dont interrupt let me finish so basically you put my life in danger i could have died or been killed at any moment all so i could learn some moronic lesson about there being no place like home i could have clicked my heels together and gone home from the get go but instead you thought it best to send me on a perilous journey where but for the grace of god and a bucket of water i could have been killed

4697184 he has had a couple of cortisone shots in that foot but every time he makes progress something bad happens
4697185 i had to take my goggles off to make sure the no 1 was next to my name on the scoreboard
4697186 michael phelps is the greatest ever weve had theres no doubt about that
4697187 he would have been first in the race no matter what
4697188 one hundreth of a second is the smallest margin of victory in our sport and it was pretty cool
4697189 im kind of scared i dont know what to expect
4697190 we were both wearing metallic goggles and couldnt see each others eyes
4697191 the last 15 meters i saw his shadow in my goggles
4697192 i didnt need to look over i knew he was there the last eight meters i just put my head down i didnt breathe the last eight meters i was just hoping for the best
4697193 i thought cavic had him beat at the 5 meters to go flags
4697194 when i did that last half stroke i thought it lost me the race
4697195 i think if we got to do this again id win it

4697212 it was a question to share or not share first place
4697213 with everything we saw the first arrival was michael phelps
4697214 i had no idea that there was a protest this is the first word i have heard of it
4697215 the timing system said it all there hasnt really ever been in an error in the timing system that i have heard of
4697216 if it was up to me i would drop the protest i didnt want to fight it its a gold medal its difficult to lose but i have to remember my goal here was bronze
4697217 if we went through this again i would win it
4697218 its hard to argue with the electronics system the problem for milorad was that his touch was too soft if the race is tight youve got to be hard on the wall
4697219 i personally looked at the video footage and it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4697220 it was clear from the video that it was an issue of stroking one was stroking and the other was gliding
4697221 according to our rules we used automatic timing system and in this case it was in perfect condition in perfect order and there are no doubts it provides for the competition at these olympic games
4697222 after watching the video footage i met with the serbian officials and gave them an explanation and offered them an opportunity to see the video themselves

4697227 having a boxer is like having another human in a dog body with you you can talk to boxers and they would understand they demonstrate feelings just like human does if they are loved they will love and protect you
4697228 boxers are the most loyal companions my boxers bring me up when i am down they are the canine clowns of the dog world they are the only dogs for me
4697229 they are a gift the two i have are always smiling and they cheer me up when i m not too happy they can be your friends for life
4697230 my boxer can take up my moods or lay quietly by my feet for hours
4697231 boxers are so intuitive so easily bored and heartbroken they are the definition of devotion and courage
4697232 if i treat my boxer puppy as an intelligent animal and talk to him almost like hes human he is more responsive and better behaved as though hes picking up on my sentiments by the way i am speaking to him
4697233 boxers can be very manipulative they are a lot smarter than they look don t get taken in by their innocent looking face or let them walk all over you no matter how much their eyes make them look like they are truly sorry
4697234 bringing a puppy or even an older dog into your home and your life is a major decision it brings with it responsibility and commitment but it also renders supreme joy laughter and sadly but inevitably tears not one of us who has ever shared his life with a boxer would have it any other way
4697235 boxer dogs think they are human treat them like one love them talk to them cuddle them and value them and you will get your love back unconditionally 10 000 times

4697257 because golf carts are not designed for the safe transportation of children their use for transporting children should be strongly discouraged in addition private and public facilities that allow golf cart use can help prevent cart related injuries by requiring drivers licenses and safety operations training establishing safety policies and considering golf cart safety in the design of pathways and landscapes given the large increase in golf cart related injuries over the study period greater efforts are needed to prevent these injuries especially among children
4697258 unless something is done immediately there will be no more lions in this part of kenya which would be a tragedy
4697259 tensions have always been high between maasai tribes and the lions in this region where the economy is cattle dependent
4697260 maasai depend on cattle to survive they view themselves as stewards of the cattle when their animals are killed their solution is to get rid of the lions we need to be able to immediately compensate the maasai for cattle losses in order to stop the killings
4697261 between 2003 and 2007 a total of 63 lions were killed in two adjacent properties owned by the maasai kuku group ranch and olgulului group ranch
4697262 on mbirikani ranch where compensation began in 2003 only four lions were killed due to predator livestock conflict during the same period
4697263 two years later rates are not as high but the killings continue to be bad enough that if something is not done immediately we will see these lions go extinct locally in just a few years
4697264 a compensation program was initiated in the kuku group ranch last year and weve already seen results
4697265 in comparison the rate of lion killing in olgulului is alarming in the last two years alone more than 40 lions have been killed by maasai members of the olgulului group ranch in retaliation for livestock losses sadly in the last two years weve also started to see lion claws and teeth sold on the black market to tourists
4697266 thankfully as a result of educational programs in the region
4697267 we have started to see instances of the ritual being rejected when the warriors arrive at a village they are being sent away
4697268 lions also are killed to garner attention from the outside world
4697269 if the maasai have grievances that they feel have not been given the attention deserved they will in some cases go on a lion or elephant killing spree hoping this will make the authorities take notice and address their concerns
4697270 if we allow lion populations to drop too low in maasailand the difference this time is that there is no source of replenishment from surrounding areas which would make the future of the maasai lions today much less certain
4697271 positive proactive programs like lion guardians are helping to improve the problem but right now we need urgent funding to stem the immediate lion slaughter crisis or else we wont have any lions to protect in the future
4697272 it is hard to imagine this part of kenya devoid of lions and the deep lion roars that so symbolize the savannas
4697273 our simple view that more nerves is sufficient to explain more brain power is simply not supported by our study
4697274 although many studies have looked at the number of neurons none has looked at the molecular composition of neuron connections we found dramatic differences in the numbers of proteins in the neuron connections between different species
4697275 we studied around 600 proteins that are found in mammalian synapses and were surprised to find that only 50 percent of these are also found in invertebrate synapses and about 25 percent are in single cell animals which obviously dont have a brain
4697276 the set of proteins found in single cell animals represents the ancient or protosynapse involved with simple behaviours
4697277 this set of proteins was embellished by addition of new proteins with the evolution of invertebrates and vertebrates and this has contributed to the more complex behaviours of these animals
4697278 the number and complexity of proteins in the synapse first exploded when muticellular animals emerged some billion years ago a second wave occurred with the appearance of vertebrates perhaps 500 million years ago
4697279 the molecular evolution of the synapse is like the evolution of computer chips the increasing complexity has given them more power and those animals with the most powerful chips can do the most
4697280 it is amazing how a process of darwinian evolution by tinkering and improvement has generated from a collection of sensory proteins in yeast the complex synapse of mammals associated with learning and cognition
4697281 this work leads to a new and simple model for understanding the origins and diversity of brains and behaviour in all species
4697282 we are one step closer to understanding the logic behind the complexity of human brains
4697283 gm and carnegie mellon university have a lengthy and successful history of working together on autonomous and robotic technologies
4697284 we have a shared vision of developing technologies that have the potential to resolve transportation challenges continuing this successful working relationship is a natural next step toward achieving our mutual goals
4697285 technologies ranging from electronics controls and software to wireless capabilities and digital mapping could ultimately change how people drive and use their vehicles
4697286 imagine being virtually chauffeured safely in your car while doing your e mail eating breakfast and watching the news the work were doing with carnegie mellon is a big stepping stone toward making this a reality
4697287 carnegie mellon has been a pioneer in autonomous navigation of robotic vehicles beginning in 1984 with our series of navlab vehicles
4697288 we are eager to see this technology used to improve the safety and convenience of the cars and trucks we depend upon every day and we could wish for no better partner than gm to make this happen
4697289 carnegie mellon is one of only 10 academic institutions around the world involved in gms crl program
4697290 working with the best in a specific field significantly expands gms technical capabilities in areas we consider strategic
4697291 research in this new lab will focus on creating and maturing the underlying technologies required to build the autonomous vehicle of the future
4697292 autonomous vehicles will change the face of transportation by reducing deaths and injuries from automobile accidents and increasing the convenience and comfort of vehicles
4697293 we are more certain than ever that the lusi mud volcano is an unnatural disaster and was triggered by drilling the banjar panji 1 well
4697294 we have known for hundreds of years that earthquakes can trigger eruptions in this case the earthquake was simply too small and too far away
4697295 we show that the day before the mud volcano started there was a huge kick in the well which is an influx of fluid and gas into the wellbore
4697296 we show that after the kick the pressure in the well went beyond a critical level this resulted in the leakage of the fluid from the well and the rock formations to the surface a so called underground blowout this fluid picked up mud during its ascent and lusi was born
4697297 there is not a hope on earth they are going to stop it now
4697298 you can plug up a hole but if you try to plug a crack stuff just flows around the plug or the crack gets bigger the well now has no effect on the erupting mud it was just the trigger that initiated it
4697299 its sad because lots and lots of people are displaced and five villages were buried in mud but it will leave us with a better understanding of the birth life and death of a volcano
4697300 i just wanted to let you know that im already down 7 lbs and its only been 2 1 2 days and im sleeping like a baby now with ambestin that stuff is better than what my doc used to prescribe
4697301 i lost 11lbs in 23 days on 3 caps per day
4697302 fastest shipping time to the uk ive ever had i find myself waking up earlier in the morning because im so anxious to take a fenphedra caplet i think this makes me an addict but i dont care this helps so much
4697303 we have developed a new method to cultivate these bacteria and can now study their main characteristics and virulence properties
4697304 the economic losses for the pork industry and the risk of the bacteria infecting humans justify the need for further research
4697305 data shows that people in close contact with pigs have a higher risk of infection this suggests h suis is a zoonotic agent capable of being transmitted from animals to humans
4697306 we know very little about how the bacterium infects humans and pigs and how it causes disease thanks to this research pure isolates of h suis are now available bringing new perspectives to the study of this organism and its interaction with the host

4697308 het protest werd echter afwezen en de servische delegatie werd hiervan schriftelijk op de hoogte gebracht wij gaven hen ook de toelating om de videobeelden van de finale te bekijken alhoewel dit normaal niet is toegelaten besloten we dit toch maar te doen omdat we niets te verbergen hadden de servi rs bekeken de beelden en raakten overtuigd van hun ongelijk
4697309 verliezen met een honderdste van een seconde is bijzonder moeilijk te aanvaarden vooral dan nog in een olympische finale al bij al is mijn medaille een klein mirakel
4697310 hoewel de wetgever een arsenaal aan beschermende maatregelen voor zwangere vrouwen heeft uitgedokterd lappen werkgevers vooral in kleinere bedrijven die regels aan hun laars

4697318 such a position brings one into the category of terrorists
4697319 the congressman has expressed his position that the only solution for the somali conflict is withdrawal of ethiopian soldiers from somalia
4697320 such a position brings one into the category of terrorists and that recommending the withdrawal of ethiopian soldiers from somalia at this time should be equated with supporting remnants of al qaeda and the uic to revive and disrupt the countrys stability
4697321 we will stay there for a few days to help the transitional government in preserving stability then we will pull out our troops this will take a week or a maximum of two weeks
4697322 when we exit from somalia it will be at the time when we are convinced that there is no imminent danger to our country

4697327 we noticed him missing on wednesday but it is possible he could have been out of his cage for a couple of days before that
4697328 after shedding his skin he is normally very active and i think that has caused the problems the whole family is gutted and we just hope someone finds him
4697329 when snakes shed their skin they normally go into hiding in the vivarium for about two weeks as it can be quite stressful but when we went to look we noticed he had gone missing
4697330 there is always a chance it is still in the house because he is quite small and often curls up in a ball but we have searched constantly for three days and we are starting to worry as he could be anywhere
4697331 if it is quite warm he will probably be somewhere curled up basking in the sun
4697332 but if it is chillier then he will look for somewhere warm and can often be found underneath something or in a flower pot
4697333 szostaks group took a creative approach to this research challenge and made a significant contribution to our understanding of small molecule transport through membranes
4697334 this is a great outcome of nsfs support of basic research
4697335 by showing that this can happen and indeed happen quite efficiently we have come a little closer to our goal of making a functional protocell that in the right environment is able to grow and divide on its own
4697336 when it comes to improving intelligence many researchers have thought it was not possible
4697337 our findings clearly show this is not the case our brain is more plastic than we might think
4697338 our findings clearly show that training on certain memory tasks transfer to fluid intelligence
4697339 we also find that individuals with lower fluid intelligence scores at pre test could profit from the training
4697340 even though it currently appears very hard to improve these conditions there might be some memory training related to intelligence that actually helps
4697341 the saying use it or lose it is probably appropriate here
4697342 if those civilizations are out there and we dont know that they are those that inhabit star systems that lie close to the plane of the earths orbit around the sun will be the most motivated to send communications signals toward earth
4697343 because those civilizations will surely have detected our annual transit across the face of the sun telling them that earth lies in a habitable zone where liquid water is stable through spectroscopic analysis of our atmosphere they will know that earth likely bears life
4697344 knowing where to look tremendously reduces the amount of radio telescope time we will need to conduct the search
4697345 the crucial implication is that this targeted search in a favored part of the sky the ecliptic stripe if you will may provide us with significantly better prospects for detecting extraterrestrials than has any previous search effort
4697346 it occurred to me that alien civilizations along the ecliptic would likely be doing similar observations to earth
4697347 once they had determined earth to be habitable they might initiate sending signals
4697348 these models are nothing but pure speculation but hey it is educational to explore possibilities
4697349 we have no idea how many if any other civilizations there are in our galaxy
4697350 they will know that life exists on earth and they will have the patience to beam easily detectable radio or optical signals in our direction if necessary for millions of years in the hope now realized that a technological civilization will appear on earth

4697366 the building will receive seismic upgrading and be an important part of our office space downtown
4697367 by choosing it as an office building theres a great chance to preserve its historic character certainly on the exterior and some of the really interesting features on the interior
4697368 that will benefit not only our retail space but all retailers in the downtown area
4697369 we are all stunned i will continue to fight as much as i possibly can
4697370 i have been in touch with a specialist immigration lawyer in london i am waiting to speak to her to see where i stand
4697371 the letter said they had reviewed my case and i had no case for compassionate grounds there was no justification as to why
4697372 if this is not a case for compassionate grounds then i dont know what is there is no one else to care for my mum
4697373 at best i have 21 days before i have to leave the country but there may be options of judicial review and looking at my mums human rights
4697374 i very much regret the news that tess henry has been told that she must leave the uk
4697375 it is beauracratic madness i have constantly argued that she should be allowed to stay on compassionate grounds
4697376 yes we need a tough and rigorous immigration system but this is simply unreasonable
4697377 i have done everything in my power to try and prolong her visit and will continue to do so
4697378 it is absolutely horrendous to be separated from my mother now is inhuman
4697379 we dont comment on individual cases all applications are carefully considered within the immigration rules taking into account any special circumstances suffolk homes
4697380 the level of enquiries that we had on thursday a level results day was well ahead from last year and there is more interest from people ringing
4697381 i would say the majority of students that we have applying are from suffolk and norfolk and the northern half of essex and eastern cambridgeshire
4697382 the majority are regional but we are also attracting people from all over the place including international students
4697383 it is really great news to hear that there is an influx of people applying to attend the new university campus suffolk
4697384 it is really important for bt to be part of a sustainable economy that allows our future generations being born in suffolk to be educated in suffolk and to ultimately be given the option of choosing a career in suffolk
4697385 this is fantastic news because suffolk in particular has had a deficit in higher education and lots of people have gone away
4697386 we are now reversing the brain drain which is fantastic and the more successful the university becomes the more people from all over the country as well as international students will come here and stay in the area it is probably the most exciting thing that has happened in ipswich and suffolk in a lifetime
4697387 it is a major job but we are on course and expecting to be handed over the building in the time scale that we envisaged and we expect to be moving people in by the middle of september
4697388 i think the new building is a physical symbol that suffolk has a university and it is a university which looks different and will be different and one that will put us right at the cutting edge of higher education development suffolk homes
4697389 its difficult to understand why flooding tsunamis storm damage and coastal processes shouldnt automatically rule out a site
4697390 who in their right mind would even consider building such a hazardous activity as a nuclear power station on the lowest lying of all the proposed sites where one report states direct inundation is a possibility and which is vulnerable to subsidence rising sea level and rollover of the blackwater estuary
4697391 even if it proves possible at great expense to protect bradwell the resulting impacts on the surrounding coasts could be catastrophic
4697392 far from being the best or even acceptable locations these sites are the soft political option
4697393 they are in nuclear friendly ownership with british energy and the nuclear decommissioning authority desperate to sell them
4697394 they are in areas already blighted by nuclear activity with local communities allegedly longing for the jobs and investment new nuclear might bring
4697395 so having already chosen its sites the government is now busily setting out criteria by which it hopes to justify its selection
4697396 a more detailed and critical examination will reveal just how preposterous it is to put new power stations and nuclear waste stores on sites on crumbling coastlines
4697397 within the strategic siting assessment the government has set out objective criteria that they will use to assess potential new nuclear build sites
4697398 british energy is carrying out extensive work on its sites including bradwell so that when final siting decisions are made they will be done so based on a comprehensive understanding of the facts
4697399 from what we know so far we believe the bradwell site will be a strong candidate for new nuclear build
4697400 elmswell is not a chocolate box village but that is not what the competition is about
4697401 when we first went to elmswell we knew it wasnt pretty but we were struck by how much is going on in elmswell with numerous clubs societies and initiatives
4697402 the village has also gone through some hard times with the closing of a bacon factory but it hasnt got people down and people are really proud to live in elmswell
4697403 new eco homes were very impressive and there were a lot of efforts to provide affordable housing
4697404 we were also impressed by elmswild a group who look after the wild spaces in the village
4697405 it is certainly a real suffolk village which is going places
4697406 at the end of october 2006 i had to go into hospital for a hip replacement the day i went in two neighbours came in and sorted out my washing and when i was in hospital i had visitors every day and while i was convalescing
4697407 when i got back home i decided to hold a party to thank all the people who helped me while i was recovering
4697408 i have a large garage so i had it in there and 50 people turned up people really put themselves out for others not just for me but for anyone we all rally round

4697410 hay un fracaso de los libros de f tbol la primera causa es que los editores creen que si en un estadio hay 100 mil personas con que el 1 5 o 10 por ciento compre libros ya hay all un gran mercado potencial y la segunda es que la gente est en un estado de futbolitis aguda por haber visto tanto f tbol que ya no quieren adem s leer de eso
4697411 es que adem s eso ha llevado a que se haya perdido el hero smo y la poes a en el f tbol hace 30 a os el f tbol era para sus seguidores un relato oral ya que a un estadio iban solamente 50 mil personas mientras que otros 3 o 4 millones lo segu an por radio figur ndose proezas a manos de hombres tit nicos en cambio desde hace unas d cadas la televisi n rompe esa imagen porque uno cree que lo que est viendo es en mayor o menor medida lo que est pasando personas normales haciendo cosas que en verdad no est n fuera del alcance humano y no esos gigantes tit nicos que nos transmit an los relatos

4697420 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i had lost the race right there but i guess that was the difference in the end
4697421 i think the biggest thing is when someone says you cant do something
4697422 it shows that anything is possible when you put your mind to it
4697423 if anyone would have said before the games that id win two golds and break the world record id have laughed in their face

4697489 one of the difficult issues in redeveloping the courthouse is theres two statutory ways in which county governments can dispose of property
4697490 but ive got to be upfront its not the county commissioners that are developing this plan
4697491 weve been clear that for county purposes were no longer going to use the former 1884 courthouse
4697492 wed be ok with taking the property if we were the least significant player
4697493 the port authority would be just one small part of the entire overall deal
4697494 mr conaway may come up with a development plan if there may be a realistic use for it we dont want to stand in the way
4697495 i as a commissioner am not spending one more dollar on developing the former courthouse if someone else can develop it and its good for the community then im willing to do it
4697496 weve got to do something not just sit around and experience gods love

4697516 you can draft all the right players but if you dont sign them it doesnt do any good
4697517 ownership allowed us to step up and sign guys that typically dont go in that range
4697518 but thats part of the process everybody waits to squeeze one more drop out of the stone for the most part youre not going to get a deal done five hours before a deadline if you didnt get one five weeks before the deadline you get it done in the last five minutes

4697584 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4697585 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4697586 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4697593 we are playing with peoples livelihoods if retailers are going to pay for these promotions out of their own money all well and good but we know from experience they will come looking for farmers to help redress the balance our costs are going up and confidence is fragile the price cutting could force more farmers to go under

4697606 ever since darwin evolutionary biologists have wondered why some lineages have diversified more than others a classical explanation is that a higher rate of diversification reflects increased ecological opportunities that led to a rapid adaptive radiation of a clade

4697637 faith thus receiving and resting on christ and his righteousness is the alone instrument of justification yet is it not alone in the person justified but is ever accompanied with all other saving graces and is no dead faith james 2 17 26 but worketh by love gal 5 6
4697638 a knowledge of history or a bare assent to certain truths
4697639 is by its very nature a living and active faith and it is not in every respect antithetical to all work faith itself is not a ground for justification neither therefore are the works that proceed from it but faith is not opposed to work if by it one should mean that only a dead inactive faith can justify us
4697640 the reformed therefore also said that indeed it is faith alone that justifies nevertheless the faith that justifies is not alone
4697641 both deny that the ground of our justification consists in the works of the law and both acknowledge that faith that is living faith the faith that includes and produces good works is the means by which the holy spirit assures us of our righteousness in christ the faith that justifies is the certainty produced in our hearts by the holy spirit of our righteousness in christ therefore not the more passive but the more lively and forceful it is the more it justifies us faith accordingly is active along with works and is brought to completion by the works james 2 22

4697646 when youre in an airplane you dont want your fuel to start solidifying
4697647 if anyone is below 50 a gallon id be stunned
4697648 with some of this sharp price collapse in commodities you would think the market would be up a lot more
4697649 the underlying factor is that credit continues to appear to be very weak
4697650 you really dont have to search hard to see why
4697651 you have higher energy prices higher fuel prices the housing slump hasnt helped by any stretch of the imagination
4697652 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4697653 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4697654 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4697655 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4697656 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
4697657 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
4697658 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4697659 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4697660 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4697661 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4697662 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4697663 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4697664 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4697665 naloxone result seems to show that the placebo effect is somehow biochemical
4697666 a variation in the speed of light could solve the problem but this too is impotent in the face of the question why
4697667 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4697668 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4697669 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4697670 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4697671 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4697672 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4697673 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4697674 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4697675 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4697676 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4697677 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4697678 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4697679 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4697680 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4697681 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4697682 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4697683 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4697684 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4697685 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4697686 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4697687 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4697688 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4697689 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4697690 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4697691 police also confirmed it has been aired to 700 people as part of the inquiry but never released publicly as part of the investigative strategy until now due to concerns that to do so would narrow the focus of the inquiry
4697692 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4697693 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4697694 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4697695 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4697696 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4697697 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4697698 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4697699 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4697700 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4697701 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4697702 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4697703 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4697704 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4697705 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4697706 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4697707 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4697708 who are open to doing something on the production side
4697709 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4697710 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4697711 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4697712 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4697713 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4697714 they accepted the ruling because it was not the human eye making the judgment
4697715 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4697716 there is no doubt the question was for him to share or not to share first place there is no doubt the first arrival was michael phelps
4697717 in the old days the judges ruled now its the timers
4697718 technology is also imperfect the hand is quicker than the eye
4697719 they couldnt believe phelps got there and im sure ill feel the same way
4697720 there hasnt really been an error in the timing system that ive ever heard of the scoreboard said i got my hand on the wall first
4697721 im not about fighting it im not angry at all
4697722 hitlers house was still standing and the fire which the s s troopers set as a final salute was lashing out the windows
4697723 hitlers munich apartment on prinzregentenplatz showing his desk with king george v mug 1945
4697724 i think going into any race there is always a little bit of pressure
4697725 my coach kim brackin and i were sitting together before the race and she was like just go in and have fun
4697726 it was a painful race and my legs hurt a bit it was my last race and i wanted to give it everything getting the gold medal is the cherry on the top
4697727 it is such a relief i am so excited i am thrilled with the time im really loving what im doing
4697728 i wanted to swim fast and from the feeling of wanting to throw up i think ive done it
4697729 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4697730 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4697731 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4697732 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4697733 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4697734 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4697735 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4697736 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4697737 especially because we had to go 120 minutes brazil only needed to play 90
4697738 but its not going to be an easy match no matter what
4697739 hopefully it wont make a difference that we had to play 120 minutes
4697740 its going to come down to details which ever team is able to perform better at the time will come away with the victory
4697741 im already cringing at the inevitable photoshops of mccain in a pool wearing little inflatable arm bands or the inevitable video collage that puts mccain right in the middle of the pool from cocoon you know the movie with all the elderly folk swimming with and re energized by alien eggs stored in a large pool
4697742 we are very excited that we are able to make allan a padre
4697743 he is a local kid whose offensive upside is a major attribute we cant wait for him to start his career
4697744 dream as big as you can dream and anything is possible
4697745 i am sort of in a dream world sometimes i have to pinch myself to make sure it is real
4697746 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4697747 when i did chop the last stroke i thought that had cost me the race
4697748 but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try to get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision
4697749 im so proud of what hes been able to do i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now
4697750 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4697751 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4697752 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4697753 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4697754 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4697755 my big goal is to change the sport of swimming
4697756 i am sure coach bob bowman and i can think of some more goals in the next four years
4697757 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4697758 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4697759 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4697760 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4697761 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4697762 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4697763 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4697764 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4697765 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4697766 i just want to go back home and keep going with university im studying french and i need to get back to it
4697767 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4697768 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4697769 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4697770 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4697771 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4697772 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4697773 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4697774 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4697775 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4697776 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4697777 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4697778 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4697779 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4697780 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4697781 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4697782 i didnt beat phelps but perhaps im the only guy at this competition who had a shot at beating phelps one on one
4697783 losing by a hundredth of a second is difficult its the hardest loss but its a complete miracle im here considering i was going to retire a year and a half ago
4697784 from my heart im enjoying it and i wish i had a gold medal but im happy with a silver
4697785 i had to help my people knowing it could be a big risk for my swimming career im proud of what i did
4697786 i had to do it to help the kosovo serbs knowing how hard it is for them there
4697787 there is a gold medal at stake but i came into this expecting bronze and i did one better and got silver and almost the gold
4697788 we all know technology today is imperfect its possible there was an error but im taking what i got and im very happy
4697789 i knew that i was leading the race after the first 50 i usually do and i knew that michael is fast in the second 50 and he would be chasing me
4697790 weve got to get wins from here on out it doesnt matter if its against a friend or someone else
4697791 i just wish the outcome was a little bit better but i was happy with the outing
4697792 it feels good you cant lie having a night like that in front of family and friends
4697793 coming home is great but thats icing on the cake right there
4697794 when youre playing in front of 50 family members and everybody is expecting something its kind of like a playoff atmosphere almost
4697795 tomorrows going to come pretty quick so you have to bounce back
4697796 we have another tough one tomorrow and one on sunday as well then weve got a pretty tough road trip so weve got to turn the page pretty quickly and find that fire again
4697797 we have to make a decision in the next day or so
4697798 the last few weeks thats what weve been doing ride the hot hand
4697799 hey ill probably get an interview at a top school

4697811 we are a sports department how would we have the ability to do that
4697812 this is about dealing with the issues that are having an impact on the lives of people in greater manchester
4697813 i dont want to detract from the great work thats taking place
4697814 dealing with firearms is an area where theres remarkable performance
4697815 but i need to have confidence and we ask that an action plan is brought to this authority on september 5 weve got our eye on this and that we are determined to get it right
4697816 ive been thinking about this for three or four years and coming to the exhibition has finally given me the push to donate my body
4697817 im a science student myself and i think its important to educate both the medical profession and the general public
4697818 im not religious my family thought it was just a whim but when i told them i had put my body forward for donation they were fine about it
4697819 this is the only chance that most people will get to have a look at what the human body is like on the inside hopefully it will give them a sense of their own mortality and theyll go away and look after themselves better this show is a celebration of life rather than death
4697820 i want to do this to help future generations out with medical research
4697821 the golden rule is are they genuine if theyre just coming in to get on tv im not interested just kick them out straight away
4697822 im not going to put people on who just dress up as a banana im not going to do it so everyone you see good or bad is sincere
4697823 there were only a couple of pallets left when it darted out really fast it was a bit of a shock and i got a fright because its not what you expect i was gob smacked
4697824 it must have been in there for four or five days so im surprised that it survived
4697825 it was quite scared and had nothing to eat or drink for days so we went out to get some food it mewed a lot and because he was from italy we were saying ciao bello
4697826 it made quite an impact on everyone and we wanted to make sure it would be okay
4697827 obviously he was very nervous at the time he was quite dirty and very hungry and thirsty
4697828 but he has turned out to be a really nice cat
4697829 we asked if she wanted to play again that evening for another 50 she told us to get stuffed she didnt even turn around
4697830 she was feisty and outspoken i think thats genuinely how she is manchester did not get a different madonna
4697831 she had a very jaundiced view of manchester at the time that was probably about right
4697832 on the last tour they played to nearly 200 000 people in manchester and the shows were amazing this is the first leg of a very long tour
4697833 i am sure they must have a surprise for manchester
4697834 we still do not know exactly what happened to my brother and we probably never will i cant believe that my brother will never come home again
4697835 as a family we are so terribly proud of ben to me he is like an olympic gold medal winner he had the most amazing drive and determination for everything he did and was achieving what most of us mere mortals would never have dreamed of
4697836 we only wish that he had been more aware of the dangers he was facing ben had not himself been exposed first hand to the devastating consequences of avalanches unlike some of his older team mates i just wish i could have warned my little brother
4697837 the remote possibility is that ben had been caught in a crevasse or hidden in a snowhole however he had only taken enough food water and gas for four to five days and it is now impossible that he could have survived at such an altitude
4697838 it is tragic that ben has met his fate in the same way
4697839 ben was the cheekiest of the cheeks it is impossible to fill the gap that he has left in our lives he was a talented drummer from the age of eight a skilled road racing cyclist traveller fire juggler and a world class climber but most importantly he was a wonderful friend to so many people who have told us that they will never forget him
4697840 the strength of feeling over the way the council has handled this review was clear workers turned out in force and were determined to make their voices heard they wanted to voice their disgust that some salaries will drop by as much as 7 500
4697841 not only have we been able to conceive and have a baby in the time its already taken them but the chances are that our daughter lucy grace could well have a little brother or sister before we get our meter
4697842 the whole six months went by without any contact from united utilities we made numerous calls to them early this year to find out what the results of the monitoring exercise were only to find we had just wasted our time
4697843 my wife was told on one occasion they didnt even know who the meter belonged to they would have to send out an inspector to check and we would have to wait another couple of months to be told anything further
4697844 i contacted them in june when i had to explain the whole saga over again and still nothing was done
4697845 the last time i rang i was told the previous person i had spoken to was off sick but have since found out they have left the company
4697846 i was promised compensation for every day we had been without a water meter but united utilities have just kept fobbing us off
4697847 we are both extremely angry and frustrated at their lack of communication and sheer incompetence
4697848 we wish to apologise to mr rolfe over the delay in getting his meter fitted
4697849 izabella is a real little cracker she eats anything and everything now and the transformation is amazing
4697850 she was tiny and very delicate it was very worrying
4697851 but she used to fidget around in the incubator and she was obviously very strong
4697852 a ventilator was helping her to breathe but she was only on it for a day and the doctors were all amazed at that she was also fed through a tube
4697853 we were really pleased when she came home and all our initial fears are now over she has done really well in the year and has only needed two hospital check ups she has piled the weight on
4697854 she is doing amazing now crawling around gurgling and laughing
4697855 she is still very petite but it looks like she is going to grow up to be quite tall
4697856 we are going to have a special party today for her and all the family are really pleased
4697857 who is more jantan who can issue more press statements

4697860 this is one of the biggest fines that has ever been handed to a restaurant owner in the city the size of the fine represents how seriously these offences are treated
4697861 keeping a restaurant in such a filthy vermin infested state shows a wanton disregard for the health of the manchester residents and visitors to the city who eat there and this fine should send out a clear message that this sort of practice will not be tolerated and restaurant owners will be prosecuted
4697862 we saw the lanterns coming out of a garden off bradfield road at about half six there was a group of three lads letting them off and three more riding on bikes to see how far they were going they were laughing at all the people staring
4697863 there are usually between 80 and 90 sightings a year and the vast majority of them are these lanterns or balloons they only cost around 3 and can be set off within minutes of being bought
4697864 its very hard to judge how big something is in the sky because there is nothing to compare things with
4697865 as for the disappearing the lantern more than likely just went behind low cloud cover rather than vanish into thin air
4697866 these product enhancements are more evidence of the additional customer benefits we are creating through our collaboration with edelweiss air
4697867 edelweiss air is already well established in the swiss market and will now also be offering our swiss customers its top class product in the leisure travel field
4697868 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
4697869 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies we are applying for eu u s antitrust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any u s or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
4697870 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry
4697871 american airlines continues to execute its fleet renewal plan to control costs while prudently reinvesting in the travel experience for customers
4697872 replacing md 80s with 737s at current fuel prices provides financial benefits while enhancing the customer experience
4697873 boeing and american airlines have enjoyed a partnership that spans more than 50 years back to the beginning of the commercial jet age todays announcement continues that long and successful history
4697874 these additional next generation 737s will enhance americans fleet with newer more efficient airplanes lowering fuel costs and lessening the environmental impact of flying

4697891 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4697892 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4697947 ciri ciri ahlus sunnah wal jamaah bahwa mereka satu tangan ikatan karena mereka bersaudara maka tidak pernah saling mengkafirkan memfasikkan dan saling membidahkan satu dengan lainnyam karena sikap sikap itu merupakan ciri khas firqoh firqoh yang sesat
4697948 barang siapa diantara kalian masih hidup sesudahku akan melihat perselisihan yang banyak maka wajib bagimu untuk berpegang teguh dengan sunnahku dan sunnahnya para khlaifah yang lurus dan mendapatkan petunjuk berpegangteguhlah dengannya dan gigitlah sunnah itu dengan gigi gerahammu serta jauhilah perkara perkara yang baru
4697949 dan orang orang yang datang sesudah mereka muhajirin dan anshor mereka berdoa
4697950 dasar dasar madzhab ahlus sunnah wal jamaah adalah selamatnya hati dan lisan mereka terhapad para sahabat dan saudara muslim mereka dimana saja dan kapan saja
4697951 dan janganlah engkau membiarkan kedengkian dalam hati kami terhadap orang orang yang beriman ya rabb kami sesungguhnya engkau maha penyantun lagi maha penyayang
4697952 salah dari kamu tidak akan beriman dengan sempurna hingga mencintai saudaranya seperti halnya mencintai dirinya sendiri
4697953 sungguh telah muncul pada zaman ini di kalangan para pemuda dan orang orang islam yang jahil terhadap hakikat islam dikarenakan semangat yang meluap dan tidak pada tempatnya sikap tabdi tafsiq dan takfir hingga kesibukan mereka dalam segala urusan hidup dipenuhi oleh sifat sifat tercela ini membahas aib aib dan menyebarkannya hingga tersebar luas ini merupakan tanda fitnah dan kehancuran kita memohon kepada allah taala agar menjaga kaum muslimin dari kejelekannya dan mengarahkan para pemuda muslim pada jalan yang benar dan menganugerahkan amal di atas manhaj salafus sholih meniti di atasnya serta menjauhkan mereka dari jahat
4697954 sesungguhnya perkataan tafsiq tabdi dan takfir adalah kalimat kotor yang tidak akan hilang begitu saja bila kata kata itu dilontarkan kepada manusia maka akan mempunyai dampak
4697955 bila seseorang berkata kepada saudaranya hai si kafir maka sungguh akan kembali ucapan itu kepada salah satu dari keduanya

4697960 hai orang orang yang beriman janganlah sekumpulan orang laki laki merendahkan kumpulan yang lain boleh jadi yang ditertawakan itu lebih baik dari mereka dan jangan pula sekumpulan perempuan merendahkan kumpulan lainnya boleh jadi yang direndahkan itu lebih baik dan janganlah suka mencela dirimu sendiri dan jangan memanggil dengan gelaran yang mengandung ejekan seburuk buruk panggilan adalah panggilan yang buruk sesudah iman dan barangsiapa yang tidak bertobat maka mereka itulah orang orang yang zalim
4697961 hai orang orang yang beriman jauhilah kebanyakan purba sangka kecurigaan karena sebagian dari purba sangka itu dosa dan janganlah mencari cari keburukan orang dan janganlah menggunjingkan satu sama lain adakah seorang diantara kamu yang suka memakan daging saudaranya yang sudah mati maka tentulah kamu merasa jijik kepadanya dan bertakwalah kepada allah sesungguhnya allah maha penerima taubat lagi maha penyayang
4697962 ghibah itu kamu menyebut saudaramu tentang apa apa yang dia tidak suka mereka bertanya ya rasulullah bagaimana pendapatmu jika yang ada pada saudaraku itu seperti yang aku katakan rasulullah menjawab jika padanya seperti yang kamu sebutkan itulah yang dinamakan ghibah dan jika tidak ada padanya maka berarti kamu telah menuduhnya
4697963 dari sini wajib bagi muslimin untuk memberikan nasehat kepada orang orang yang panjang lidah dan mengingkari mereka dengan sekeras keras pengingkaran serta mencegah upaya upaya mereka
4697964 hai orang orang yang beriman janganlah kamu mengikuti langkah langkah syaitan
4697965 serulah manusia kepada jalan tuhan mu dengan hikmah dan pelajaran yang baik dan bantahlah mereka dengan cara yang baik
4697966 barang siapa yang beramal tanpa ada perintah dari kami maka tertolak
4697967 serulah mereka ke jalan tuhanmu dengan hikmah dan mauidhah hasanah dan bantahlah mereka dengan cara yang lebih baik
4697968 dan katakanlah wahai kamu berdua kepadanya firaun perkataan yang lembut semoga dia ingat dan takut
4697969 even if the water comes strongly we have a lot of places to store
4697970 how did this happen i was thinking about testing the water for a run maybe in 2012 what are we going to do if we win
4697971 i believe that theyve changed their mind its not a money negotiating issue as much as a life choice at this moment in time
4697972 neither one of us could probably answer why we were getting one in the first place
4697973 things have been going so great that someone actually had to remind us that hey you do remember those papers are still there literally it was days ago
4697974 so weve agreed that before we leave florida in a few days well make sure that thats gone away
4697975 the kids and i kind of learned about the divorce at the same time
4697976 so that was hard that was probably the worst part of the whole thing was being able to deal with how hurt the whole kids were

4697980 the splitter was great until the home run to blake that was the only mistake to that point that was the only mistake i made with that pitch other than that it was as good as its been all year
4697981 i feel like thats been the way its been all year for me

4697988 i am concerned for the security of our great nation not so much because of any threat from without but because of the insidious forces working from within
4697989 the missing link in the vote fraud investigation has been found
4697990 these ostensibly independent voting machines are each driven by its own mini computer
4697991 how can tens of thousands of these independent voting machines in tens of thousands of separate locations possibly be manipulated without involving tens of thousands of people
4697992 of course when the same company that writes the source code also designs the internal modem the possibilities are endless for accessing the computer either before during or after the election to alter or at least interrogate the computers vote count it raises the specter of a remote high speed vote rigging computer automatically and surreptitiously contacting querying and rapidly adjusting the votes inside many precincts and or central counting machines nationwide
4697993 dr ohalloran verified his bombshell findings from the following sources 1 global election systems which makes the popular accu vote optical scanner 2 the web site of the largest supplier of computer voting systems in the usa business records corporation brc 3 pj lyon 25 year computer veteran with brc at berkeley who maintains the brcs source code 4 penelope bonsall long standing spokes person for the fec and 5 the clerks office of birmingham michigan
4697994 the doubleday technician explained that special command cards can be inserted into the machine to tell the precinct computer to call the central computer with results
4697995 you have to program the phone number into the card the card accesses the modem and the card tells it to dial into the central computer to close the election you slide the ender card like a special ballot which has certain codes on it and tells it to lock up the election
4697996 modem communications and results transfer capability from the precinct with the optech iii p eagle and regional accumulation with the smart pack receiving system
4697997 the presence of an internal hidden modem which could allow outside access to the computer without anyones knowledge
4697998 a modem in an election computer would be highly suspect
4697999 you cant insulate a computer from outside communication if you have a modem in it there would be a sub routine in the source code program which would cause the results being turned into the central computer to be phoned to you too so that you could find out how many votes you needed to steal the election
4698000 our analysis shows that this voting system is far below even the most minimal security standards applicable in other contexts
4698001 as a society we must carefully consider the risks inherent in electronic voting as it places our very democracy at risk
4698002 the real menace of our republic is this invisible government which like a giant octopus sprawls its slimy length over city state and nation like the octopus of real life it operates under cover of a self created screen at the head of this octopus are the rockefeller standard oil interests and a small group of powerful banking houses generally referred to as international bankers the little coterie of powerful international bankers virtually run the united states government for their own selfish purposes they practically control both political parties
4698003 for the record this article is completely wrong i dont know where the information came from but it certainly wasnt from us at harmonix when we have accurate and reliable information on an aus launch of rb pricing dates etc well post it here for you until you get word from us here on this site its probably safe to assume that anything else is speculation or rumour

4698007 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
4698008 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
4698009 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
4698010 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
4698011 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
4698012 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government

4698015 we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract
4698016 we cannot dedicate we can not consecrate we can not hallow this ground
4698017 they pick the most dangerous enemy they can find and its themselves
4698018 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
4698019 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
4698020 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
4698021 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
4698022 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
4698023 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
4698024 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american

4698170 there has been much in the press about beijings bad outdoor air pollution problems
4698171 but in reality the average person spends 90 of their time indoors it is indoor air that most affects our health while we cant do much about outdoor air we can take control of our indoor environments and make them healthy that is what we have done here with clean air apartment we have taken a normal apartment in the worlds most polluted city and turned it into one of the healthiest indoor environment that can be found anywhere in the world
4698172 we had to keep our project with athletes top secret for more than a year but now that the games have begun we can finally talk about it in all of the excitement of the competitions and people winning medals we didnt want to lose focus that what we are really about is creating healthy homes there are hundreds of millions of people around the world with severe allergies asthma other respiratory conditions and environmental sensitivities we are introducing to the world an innovative new kind of air cleaning technology that comprehensively removes indoor airborne irritants like dust mold pollen diesel soot allergens even bacteria and viruses at a level never before previously possible in homes clean air apartment gives us the opportunity to show people that this technology isnt just for helping athletes win medals its for improving your health and your families health in your home
4698173 we are data logging outdoor and indoor levels of airborne particles in terms of pm 10 pm 2 5 and pc 0 3
4698174 most of the government agencies have been reporting pm 10 levels in beijing but we think that is outdated pm 2 5 is a better and pc 0 3 is the best base measure of particulate air pollution most particles in pm 10 are relatively large particles so to speak sort of the rocks in the air but it is the submicron particles that are actually most dangerous to people these ultra fine particles are capable of penetrating lung tissue and entering the blood stream
4698175 when you consider that most air purifiers that people purchase at department stores improve you air quality by less than 5 in your home
4698176 we were very happy when we approached the 90 purity mark but then as the systems continued to clean already filtered air we rapidly saw the numbers go up a percentage point or two each day when we consistently reached 95 we were honestly able to say that we have better air here in our apartment in beijing than you have in the swiss alps
4698177 weve done many things over the last few years to try to demonstrate and educate people about what is really possible with good air cleaning
4698178 there are a lot of families out there with children with severe allergies and asthma and we are trying to raise awareness about an innovative new technology that can genuinely improve peoples lives

4698204 we have received feedback from australian players association and like us they have also expressed their reservations over playing in pakistan

4698207 we advise you to reconsider your need to travel to sri lanka at this time because of the very high risk of politically motivated violence attacks in colombo have become more frequent and have killed many civilians further attacks can happen at any time anywhere in sri lanka australians could inadvertently become victims of violence directed at others

4698233 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4698234 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas

4698236 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
4698237 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4698238 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4698239 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4698240 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas

4698243 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
4698244 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
4698245 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
4698246 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
4698247 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
4698248 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables
4698249 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro
4698250 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
4698251 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
4698252 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
4698253 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
4698254 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
4698255 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
4698256 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
4698257 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4698258 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4698259 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4698260 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
4698261 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
4698262 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
4698263 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4698264 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4698265 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4698266 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4698267 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4698268 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4698269 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
4698270 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
4698271 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
4698272 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n

4698333 ik weet dat dinsdag de ogen op mij gericht zullen zijn ik sta dit seizoen elfde op de wereldranglijst er wordt echt heel ver geworpen maar dit is enorm goed voor het zelfvertrouwen
4698334 dat was ook voldoende geweest voor de finale maar het was een week geleden dat ik met de discus had geworpen ik wilde graag nog een poging doen het gevoel was goed lekker ontspannen
4698335 ik heb met de kogel drie goede jaren gehad je weet dat er een moment komt dat het eens een jaar minder gaat je hoopt alleen dat dat niet in een olympisch jaar gebeurt in 2003 heb ik ook zon jaar gehad het juiste gevoel zal echt wel weer een keer terugkomen
4698336 dat biedt perspectief ik had er niet aan moeten denken dat we nu al hadden verloren we wilden door
4698337 eigenlijk hebben we onze tegenstander geen moment in de wedstrijd laten komen door de service van richard bleven zij voortdurend onder grote druk en wij konden ons niveau de hele partij vasthouden
4698338 eerlijk gezegd hebben we het getroffen bij de loting de amerikaanse wereldkampioen komen we nu eventueel pas in de halve finale tegen dat zien we dan wel weer
4698339 the machine is performing excellently and we have been able to see considerable reductions in waste and downtime most importantly to the growth of our business is that it has increased our productivity far more than we had anticipated
4698340 pfm has been extremely supportive and helpful in terms of the guidance provided by the engineers when installing the equipment the service levels from pfm far exceeded our expectations and the delivery time was impressively quick i would have absolutely no problem in recommending pfm to another company

4698343 our existing production line was totally efficient for the products it was packaging but for this job we needed something a little bit different and quality pack presentation was essential so we spoke to pa to see what they could offer i could not be happier with their approach and the support and level of service we have received
4698344 initially the order was for three ready meal lines but at the last minute the retailer added a new line which needed high oxygen map the machine order had already been placed but within just four days pa had sorted out the equipment to do exactly what we needed i have never known such a rapid response from a company
4698345 we have been hugely impressed with the personal service we have received throughout the project the response from the whole pa team has been excellent and i would certainly recommend them to anyone else looking for tray sealing equipment the machine we are using was very competitively priced and the service we have received has been second to none

4698354 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4698355 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4698356 they accepted the ruling because it was not the human eye making the judgment
4698357 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4698358 there is no doubt the question was for him to share or not to share first place there is no doubt the first arrival was michael phelps
4698359 in the old days the judges ruled now its the timers
4698360 technology is also imperfect the hand is quicker than the eye
4698361 they couldnt believe phelps got there and im sure ill feel the same way
4698362 there hasnt really been an error in the timing system that ive ever heard of the scoreboard said i got my hand on the wall first

4698378 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4698379 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4698380 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4698381 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4698382 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4698383 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4698384 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4698385 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4698386 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4698387 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4698388 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4698389 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4698390 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4698391 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4698392 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4698393 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4698394 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4698395 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4698396 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4698397 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4698398 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4698399 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4698400 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4698401 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4698402 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4698403 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4698404 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4698405 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4698406 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4698407 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4698408 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4698409 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4698410 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4698411 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4698412 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4698413 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4698414 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4698415 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4698416 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4698417 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4698418 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4698419 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4698420 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4698421 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4698422 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4698423 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4698424 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4698425 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4698426 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4698427 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4698428 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4698429 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4698430 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4698431 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4698432 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4698433 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4698434 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4698435 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4698436 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4698437 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4698438 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4698439 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

4698490 casey on the new website and ebook i am a bit confused about exactly what is going on right now but i still have faith in you and hope that you have a plan b in place
4698491 i told you casey is a superstar hes even got you groupie haterz to prove it at least i am not hanging on his every word like a loozer
4698492 is this niche willing to spend money are the people in this group willing to pay for a solution to their problem in the form of an ebook course seminars or whatever thats because some markets are research markets where people arent motivated enough to spend money
4698493 them haterz cant stand somebody being positive around here so youre getting double the hate sorry to see it but thats the way this crazy internet works with anonymous loosers that have nothing better to do than take cheap shots at people and say things they would never say in real life especially if theyre on a mach ave at 8pm in detroit hehe
4698494 the internet seems to bring out the extremes and levels the playing field in some ways
4698495 im going to read steve pavlinas excellent articles on becoming an early riser and to remind myself of some helpful techniques
4698496 last night i wanted to go be early but simply couldnt fall asleep so i put the alarm clock on the opposite side of the room so that i have to get up to turn it off
4698497 the whole idea that you should sleep at night for eight hours or so is a relatively new phenomenon
4698498 he does not need advice on how to sleep he needs to sleep when he feels like it and not worry about sleeping during the hours that most people would consider normal sleeping time he does not need to wake up early to go to work the next day so he can sleep whenever he wants
4698499 polyphasic sleep is peaked my interest when i first heard about it a couple of years ago steve pavlina did a whole experiment on polyphasic sleep where he slept about 20 minutes every 4 hours or was it 6 or something like that amazing stuff i think becoming an early riser is the first order of business and then perhaps trying polyphasic

4698501 oh one more thing hell yeah your e book is gonna sell
4698502 and its not just that the entire ebook market is beset with ridiculous proprietary formats clunky readers and expensive texts being pushed by companies whose only knowledge of books is a hazy memory of drawing moustaches on sperms in science class even amazon which built an empire on the blighters seems to have forgotten why we love them digital texts cost more than paperbacks you cant share them and its reader looks as if it were built in 1893 and runs on steam amazon quite contrary to its claims doesnt have an ebook strategy so much as a series of really bad ideas all lined up in a row
4698503 but i like even more his moral qualities his intelligence and so on hes a nice guy who made some mistakes not a crook or an idiot
4698504 your comment was caught in my spam filter prob cuz of the links but thanks you for your comment these looser haterz only know how to hate youre exactly right a lot of people buy ebooks they need a fast solution and if theyre willing to spend money
4698505 its a good thing youve been watching all those after school specials
4698506 i reviewed steve pavlinas excellent articles on how to become an early riser part 1 and part 2 as well as how to get up right away when your alarm goes off not wasting any time i already did the suggested simulation exercises today 5 times to train the subconscious mind what to do in preparation for tomorrow morning
4698507 the 27th day is my birthday sep 10th so i will give myself a day off to celebrate my success

4698517 if it was good enough for our grandparents its good enuff for me i mean i dont even need to track moon probe trajectories or nothin i just want to go surfin like everyone else so i finally get this big brain box home and i have to clean all of my bug out and fallout shelter stuff out
4698518 100 success paid my credit card bills minimum payments total 1 100 per month its a tough nut to crack right now so i better keep moving forward on the internet marketing and other ventures still working on finishing the freebie and doing a launch hopefully by friday saturday and sunday is gold prospecting
4698519 went to store to buy a computer and got scared away by these young punk know it all salesmen with their new fangled jargon and beanie propeller hats all this bizness bout hard drives and scuzzy interfaces multimedia this quad core all this new fangled foolishness everybody knows its all the same stuff year after year they just change the names to make it sound new so that everyone will go and and buy the new stuff

4698521 i know that i may come of as a biased supporter at times but i am actually quite neutral regarding the entire saga it was even quite amusing there for a while and served to fill the breaks in my day i am passionate about the story i admit but in my case not that it matters is more like a feeling of disdain that i have for what i call the really hardcore haterz
4698522 murses my past does not equal my future my mistakes do not define me my recovery from mistakes does every time i fall i will get up one more time i may be a slow learner but with persistence i will get there one becomes a failure at the very moment they give up trying

4698524 dude not to be nasty here but you are probably being just as productive asleep as most people are
4698525 mom and dad are not bankrolling me im paying rent and the credit cards i make money by doing website design and internet work for my previous client job and referring short sales there was a month where i couldnt make payments so i had to resort to paying one credit card with another i hate doing that but better than defaulting the assets are going up quite fast so a small increase in liabilities is not all that bad
4698526 working on 10 ways its actually now 7 ways i decided i dont have enough info on some of the techniques its coming along quite nice im very excited to get this info to the people that need it
4698527 very few people have the right attitude to succeed big playing small and playing safe is ok nothing wrong with that but i like to make the most of this life
4698528 payyourtaxes i actually wouldnt mind visiting a shrink just for fun and to see what they say but only if i can find a way to keep that stuff off my medical record also right now im too lazy to actually find one in sacramento or call for referrals ive got work to do maybe later

4698589 what do we really know about information and how we use the brain to think and act and create our inner self and personality and what can quantum physics tell us about the human mind and the universe is there a connection between the quantum and the classical systems that we are only now uncovering with the help of the incorporation of both classical and quantum physics this theoretical restriction by neurological and the biological sciences is motivated primarily by ideas about the natural world that have been known to be fundamentally incorrect for over a century contemporary basic physical theory differs profoundly from its seventeenth to nineteenth century forbearers on the important matter of how the consciousness of human mind enters into the structure of empirical phenomena or how the workings of the anomic level or quantum dynamics differs from the molecular and classical dynamics and vice versa today our new understanding of the mind humans thought process i areas like like b c i systems research and the evidence of e e g researcher the physics and the universe have given us new principles that contradicts the older ideas that local mechanical neurological processes alone can account for the structure of all observed behaviour personality consciousness belief systems creation conception and our excess of memories and past information and data to learn new mental and physical experiences that are who we are quantum physical theories bring directly and irreducibly into the overall causal structure certain psychologically described choices made by human agents about how they will act think live and learn to develop there own individual personality the key development in basic physical theory is applicable to neuroscience and it provides neuroscientists and psychologists with an alternative and un bias view conceptual framework for describing neural processes and how they do have quantum counter effects of that the quantum effects create the neurological factors indeed due to certain structural features of ion charged atoms channels critical to synaptic function quantum and electro magnetic field dynamic physical theory and photon dynamics must in principle be used when analyzing human brain mind dynamics and the quantum world that exists within our classical material word as with any argument the electromagnetic field changes every time we thing or do any mental or physical action so what comes first the quantum to the mind then to the brain to control the body and the way we used stimuli or like some people thick that the brain dictates thinking and so you get a transmission from brain to mind to brain again the problem of consciousness has both philosophical and scientific aspects as both hold weight in this argument and so is full of open ended opinions and theories by all areas of science and philosophical analysis there are the neuro biologists and physicist psychologists and new in the last 10 years quantum analysis of the brain and human thought process that controls it but this argument can be put into foundation areas the classical ideas and the quantum ideas both of the above areas of study have a strong evidence basis both on a scientific and philosophical level on the neurological side we know the brain in the master centre of the body and that without it we would not be able to use it to control and mediate our conscious mental self in the world around us but on the quantum level the brain and the way it transmits falls into the area of quantum physics as the ions in the micro tubes of the nerve cells are charges atoms and so quantum behaviour is important in this development in the research of human thought process ad mind consciousness study as this ion channel could be the possible mechanism behind human governance over the brain in both everyday life and psychological mental illness and the way humans tent to override there brain and biological functions this process could be seen to encode the cell to produce complicated neuro transmitters that allow the cell to communicate with the adjoining cell and that process is an electrical ionic transmission one major factor in the argument of minds and consciousness is that most of the tests in science today by neurological research are all based on human interaction and so the evidence can be contradictive based on a large amount of individuals and how there brains have developed on an individual bases on how they have lived and developed there synaptic connections over there live what we see in any of the quantum or neurological evidence and research is this 1 the action of human thought is the starting point of the brains cognitive and mediation of the lobes body chemical secretion and senses perception as again human sensory stimuli is individual and will be used differently by different people on a neurological level even the autonomic functions are included as human mental illness overrides the brain and causes chemical and neurological dysfunction in human thought and mental physical co ordination when an individual is in a state of mental illness it truly is a state of mind over matter 2 that the bran is our means of interacting with the classical world and learning form the stimulation we receive from it ad how we use it which again is individual the brain is our sensory receptor the world around us this can be see in the research of b c i systems brain computer interface and shows in great detail how we configure and mediate our brain on an electromagnetic level of physics and this then falls again into quantum physics as e m f are produced by complex transfers of photons by electrons this will be detailed in more depth in later pages 3 that if this is true and then there is another form of interactive science at play that we are yet to understand and an incorporation of the quantum and classical science is the way forward on the scientific side the task is to identify which occurrences in humans and other intelligent beings constitute conscious experience and if the brain is any way mind itself and what is one is dominant over the other does mind control bran or brain the mind we can expect advancements in physiology psychology neurology quantum mechanics and the cognitive science to help here but not underestimating the benefits of non scientific analysis as how we think the way in witch we think about things and the creative conception is in itself what we are studying the human mind as our knowledge of the structure and function of the human brain progresses we should be able to see more clearly what is common to those cognitive states of which we are consciously aware but we know that pre thought process of mind is what initiates the nerve conduction in the brain and the cognitive effects that co ordinate the rest of the body and brain together also we can not dismiss areas of philosophical methods of study as the mind is not always analyzable by science so rules of interference are called for to resolve understanding of mind and the brain and illness caused by mental physical effects and mental interactions mental illness is one major factor in the brain mind argument as mental illness is a direct conflict of the mind overriding the brain and stopping it doing its job correctly running the biological and chemical body another argument is the free will versus determinisms again this is a conception of human thinking as both free will and determinisms are concepts of the way in which we think and interact with the world i go to work because i need to work i dont want to work that part of my life is determined just is having a good home and food in our bellies now f we take a poor and run down country they existence would be materially less then ourselves no water food home health care

4698591 ion channels when nerve cells in the central or peripheral nerves system fire together which they do even for the smallest of mental physical interaction their electromagnetic field combine to generate stronger field disturbances and there fore different frequencies so simultaneous neuron firing will tend to have a bigger impact on the brains electromagnetic field than the firing of individual neurons so we can see that cellular function of the interactions with the mind and brain work on both a automaton

4698594 we had previously demonstrated that grp stimulates the growth of this particular cancer
4698595 this time we wanted to demonstrate the opposite effects by targeting grp receptors in neuroblastoma to see if we could make the cancer regress
4698596 in order for cells in a soft agar colony to proliferate and grow without adhering to a surface they have to possess malignant properties as in the original neuroblastoma cells
4698597 however our grp receptor silenced neuroblastoma cells behaved like nonmalignant cells their growth was significantly inhibited and they formed fewer new colonies
4698598 we wanted to see how these neuroblastoma cells would behave whether they would grow and or metastasize to the liver
4698599 the cancer cells that expressed the grp receptors behaved as we expected with rapid growth as well as aggressive liver metastases the implication is that the metastatic behavior of this cancer is driven by grp and its receptor
4698600 with the publication of our data we would like to propose an application involving a number of institutions to move forward with a phase 1 clinical trial using this fda approved grp receptor antagonist for neuroblastoma
4698601 we hope to demonstrate the safety of targeting grp receptors for effective inhibition of neuroblastoma growth and metastasis this is just such a tragic disease and with all the advances were making we ought to be able to make a dent in it
4698602 fda is the government agency we rely upon to assess food contact products theyve assessed this issue in great detail and their conclusion is very reassuring
4698603 its ironic fda would choose to ignore dozens of studies funded by the national institutes of health this countrys best scientists and instead rely on flawed studies from industry
4698604 inconsistencies and inadequacies which limit the interpretations of the findings
4698605 for this to come out on a friday afternoon just before california takes action it definitely raises some eyebrows
4698606 the fda alone simply lacks the ability to serve as the sole guarantor of drug safety
4698607 the fda would be stripped of an essential source of information that the agency has consistently relied on when making its regulatory decisions and the american public would be deprived of a vital deterrent against pharmaceutical company misconduct
4698608 the law in the devices case had a pre emption provision
4698609 congress has never put a pre emption provision in the food and drug act
4698610 fda considers and approves specific labeling for a drug and the drug manufacturer is generally barred from making unilateral changes to the fda approved labeling
4698611 even if the fda is doing the best it can it simply cant see the future clearly enough to pre empt manufacturers from litigation
4698612 the court system represents one of the key defense mechanisms that individuals have if a manufacturer has not made the risks of a product clear to the public
4698613 obviously more of this water will be traversable in more parts of the year so we want to find it before hollywood
4698614 its very exciting its like an indiana jones adventure its searching for a lost under water tomb
4698615 our objective is to find and protect the wreck because they are in danger of being found by people who dont have the know how and the same intention and preoccupation that we have

4698620 louisianas overall economy is strong home prices are stable and interest rates remain favorable
4698621 throughout the state we are seeing a very solid housing market
4698622 from a national perspective there are certainly areas of the country that are experiencing problems with overpricing and foreclosures but this has to be viewed in perspective
4698623 2007 was actually the fifth best year on record and very similar to the home sales and price gains experienced in 2002 when consumers across the country were very confident about the market
4698624 its true that nationally real estate has taken a hit this year
4698625 but it is important for people in louisiana to understand that we have weathered that storm and have actually come out on top
4698626 buying a home in louisiana now is as good of an investment as ever and over the past 40 years no other investment has delivered a more consistent positive return than real estate
4698627 louisiana is just not seeing the same problems regarding subprime loans that are being publicized nationwide
4698628 it is important for buyers and sellers to understand that real estate markets are highly localized
4698629 what impacts one area strongly may be irrelevant someplace else
4698630 even on the state level it is important to evaluate each locality as its own separate market in order to understand what is going on there in observing what is happening throughout our state our market is strong
4698631 how can i know gods will for my life what does the bible say about knowing gods will

4698633 delight yourself in the lord and he will give you the desires of your heart
4698634 the most important is hear o israel the lord our god the lord is one 30 and you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength 31 the second is this you shall love your neighbor as yourself there is no other commandment greater than these

4698670 but it was not faked and what we did in order to validate it was to go to dr ian donald in scotland who is the father of ultra sound the inventor of ultra sound and he looked at the film and he swore an affidavit that everything was as it was shown and there was no doctoring or manipulation or any changes in the speed or anything else
4698671 um dos mitos que foi dado para o p blico atrav s da m dia foi que legalizando o aborto s significaria que os abortos ilegais passariam a ser legais mas na verdade o aborto est agora sendo usado principalmente como m todo de controle de natalidade em todo o mundo como tamb m nos estados unidos

4698774 i was able to theoretically confirm that planned design changes to the current bifilar fault current limiter being developed by siemens and american superconductor would decrease ac losses in the system
4698775 my calculations are good news for the future of the device
4698776 i modeled the bifilar design as an infinite stack of superconducting tapes in which adjacent tapes carry current in opposite directions
4698777 i was able to find an exact solution for the magnetic fields and currents that are generated in such a stack of tapes once i calculated how the magnetic flux penetrates into the tape i then could calculate how much energy is lost in each current cycle for different tape widths and spacings between adjacent tapes
4698778 clems result was not obvious since there are competing mechanisms for ac loss in the bifilar configuration it turns out that for typical parameters when the spacing between adjacent tapes is small enough the result is very simple ac losses decrease as the tape width increases and the spacing decreases
4698779 this result is helping to guide us and our partner siemens in an optimized design for a fault current limiter in a major doe sponsored program and it is expected to open a path to a commercial product in the future

4698799 o que importa ressaltar que o modernismo desenfreado dos nosso dias irremediavelmente ambivalente tende por sa natureza embora o conteste a arruinar a f crist envidando os seus melhores esfor os para a esvaziar de todo o conte do mas a verdade que h um bom n mero de indiv duos que o aceitam como um esfor o para dar a esta f uma esp cie de testemunho desesperado porque sinceramente n o h d vida e por vezes na febre e na ang stia de uma alma profundamente religiosa que os corifeus do nosso neo modernismo se declaram crist os

4698802 o papa recomendou nos que o aggiornamento n o de modo algum uma adapta o da igreja ao mundo como se este houvesse de regulamentar aquela p r em dia posi es essenciais da pr pria igreja pois bem a insist ncia do esquema xiii constitui o pastoral sobre a condi o humana no mundo de hoje sobre a pessoa humana uma not vel ilustra o dessa verdade efectivamente o que ali aparece um contraste chocante entre a igreja e o mundo nesta comunidade de pessoas humanas que uma sociedade a igreja conforme as exig ncias da verdade d o primado pessoa sobre a comunidade ao passo que o mundo de hoje d primazia comunidade sobre a pessoa desacordo bastante significativo e de alto interesse na nossa idade de civiliza o a igreja tornar se cada vez mais e bendita seja ela o ref gio e o apoio porventura nico da pessoa considerando se portanto na perspectiva do genesis e da suma teol gica ou por outras palavras considerando a natureza humana e o mundo naquilo que os constitui em si mesmos a constitui o pastoral afirma de ambos sem rodeios a sua bondade radical e o apelo para o progresso que pode ser contrariado ou pela ambiguidade da mat ria ou pelas feridas do pecado mas que se encontra inscrito na sua ess ncia e mostra de uma maneira n o s geral mas numa an lise muito puxada e com aquela inteira generosidade que decorre da divina caridade como a igreja permanecendo sempre no dom nio da sua miss o toda espiritual e das coisas que pertencem a deus pode e quer ajudar o mundo e a esp cie humana no esfor o para avan arem para os seus fins temporais a dizer a verdade a doutrina perenal da igreja que se encontra assim reafirmada mas com notas novas e singularmente importantes porque ela reafirmada sob o signo da liberdade n o para reivindicar o direito da igreja intervir ratione peccati nas coisas do mundo para nele reprimir o mal mas para declarar o seu direito e a sua vontade de animar estimular e assistir do alto por assim dizer e sem invadir a autonomia do temporal os desenvolvimentos do mundo para um maior bem a atingir
4698803 tamb m verdade que o segundo conc lio do vaticano foi o an ncio de uma idade nova desta o pr prio conc lio indicou os grandes tra os ao passo que aggiornamentava os eternos tesouros da igreja gra as a uma tomada de consci ncia mais profunda e a uma melhor explicita o de certas verdades encerradas nestes tesouros por outro lado podemos notar que por um paradoxo que n o raro na hist ria humana acontece que aquilo que disforme e torcido vai frente do que direito assim como os produtos da imita o batem os produtos aut nticos

4698815 larry charles theory is just keep going till they throw you out i guess he learned that on borat the crew would set up and at the last second when the cameras were already rolling i would show up so either theyd be seen on camera leaving the interview and lose face or theyd have to talk to me it was like and now heres bill you could usually see the troubled looks on their faces at the holy land theme park the pr woman freaked out and finally told us to leave she was definitely not a happy camper

4698825 i think it was good that so many people went and said what they needed to i dont think the housing authority was aware of all of it

4698936 we are extremely excited that we were able to reach an agreement with allan dykstra this evening
4698937 it came down to the last hour we spoke earlier this afternoon and we had some conversations that obviously picked up as we neared the signing deadline
4698938 since it was at the deadline hour there are still some language issues and things we have to deal with the contract eventually thatll get out
4698939 we came to an agreement a verbal agreement and the commissioners office is very well aware of what the signing bonus is and im sure that in the next couple days youll be sure what that is
4698940 allan had a strong desire to play for the padres
4698941 it was his favorite team his hometown team and we selected him no 23 overall so we certainly didnt want to run into long term problems from an organizational standpoint i mean you have an extremely talented individual that hopefully long term has a very successful career and we reap the benefits and he does as well
4698942 he certainly missed some time this summer to get a chance to play with class a eugene
4698943 but the key thing is that we got it done and i think it just adds to an already very good 2008 draft and now it makes it all that more successful having dykstra now as a part of the padres family
4698944 he has the type of power that plays at petco
4698945 this ballpark certainly wont be able to hold him its hard to find those types of players out there
4698946 youd like him to interact with his teammates and get a feel for the organization staff and players that are here and are going to be working with him hopefully hell be playing with them for many years
4698947 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time

4698955 yes ideally we would like a vote formalizing the ceasefire this weekend

4699225 this would be impossible without the cooperation of russian and georgian authorities
4699226 these findings may suggest a new approach to treating serious strep infections by supporting our bodys natural defense system
4699227 lacking this single protease the mutant strep strain was easily killed by human neutrophils
4699228 in addition the mutant strep bacteria no longer produced a spreading infection when injected into the skin of experimental mice
4699229 in addition to attempting to kill the bacteria directly with standard antibiotics new treatment strategies could be targeted to inhibit the strep protease and thereby disarm the pathogen making it susceptible to clearance by our normal immune defenses
4699230 this was unexpected we really did not expect to see the tumor promoting activity of these creams
4699231 we thought it would be prudent to test dermabase by itself to see if it had tumor promoting activity
4699232 we did not think it would but lo and behold to our surprise we got an increased rate of skin cancer
4699233 the answer is we dont know our study raises a red flag and points out the need for epidemiologists to take a look at people who use moisturizing creams and the companies that market these products should take a look at animal models and see if their products promote tumors
4699234 this study could definitely be a warning to alert these companies to consider testing moisturizing creams with some sort of assay
4699235 these creams need to be tested first before they come to market
4699236 it is by far the most common cancer we deal with skin cancers account for more than half of all cancers combined but most skin cancers are totally curable
4699237 we need to moisturize otherwise our skin gets dry and we get rashes and so on it is too soon to say from this study people should stop moisturizing
4699238 we have just learned about this study and are currently reviewing it to understand the findings
4699239 eucerin original creme has been on the market for more than 100 years and is a highly respected dermatologist recommended brand it has been widely used by both individuals with normal skin and those with diseased skin under the care of physicians and no incidents of this nature have ever been reported
4699240 treatment with vanicream skin cream clearly did not increase the proportion of animals that developed tumors
4699241 the product has been around for 50 years and has no safety issues related to it

4699249 the political future of president musharraf is a matter to be decided by the pakistani people through normal constitutional channels washington should not do anything that appearing as thwarting their will
4699250 i am heartened by the reconciliation of the leading political parties in pakistan and their decision to break the deadlock which has virtually immobilized the pakistani government in recent months
4699251 christs faithful have the right indeed at times the duty in keeping with their knowledge competence and position to manifest to the sacred pastors their views on matters which concern the good of the church they have the right also to make their views known to others of christs faithful but in doing so they must always respect the integrity of faith and morals show due reverence to the pastors and take into account both the common good and the dignity of individuals

4699265 indias commitments under the current terms of the proposed arrangement do not justify making far reaching exceptions to international non proliferation rules and norms
4699266 unlike 178 other countries india has not signed the comprehensive test ban treaty ctbt it continues to produce fissile material and expand its nuclear arsenal as one of only three states never to have signed the nuclear non proliferation treaty npt it has not made a legally binding commitment to achieve nuclear disarmament
4699267 it will create a dangerous distinction between good proliferators and bad proliferators and sends out misleading signals to the international community with regard to npt norms
4699268 foreign nuclear fuel supplies would free up indias relatively limited domestic supplies to be used exclusively in its military nuclear sector thereby indirectly contributing to the potential expansion of indias nuclear arsenal
4699269 support measures that would avert further damage to the already beleaguered global non proliferation and disarmament regime

4699291 anybody can say whatever they want but i know im clean
4699292 people can question it all they want but the facts are the facts i have the results to prove it
4699293 this is something that i caught onto just before 2000 when there was so much search engine craze running around and started doing small just to test things at first but which i later expanded on after getting the hang of it
4699294 ive actually gotten over 87 million in advertising that using my secret i never had to pay for and the largest share of which was more recently in google pay per clicks as well as other forms of pad advertising at search engines all of which i got for free

4699300 beyonces getting double teamed to give in and get pregnant
4699301 both her husband and her mother want to see her have a child
4699302 he and beyonce dated for years now theyre married and for him its time for children
4699303 we have been a team that has been under the bar a team that hadnt been able to get over the hump in major competitions and not been able to beat the european power
4699304 for me personally i felt today was the trademark of seven years of work with the program
4699305 the most important thing is we played well as a team
4699306 individual performances dont mean anything at an olympic games you can score 30 points a game but your team does not go through to the next round
4699307 today we executed what we were supposed to do we took russia out of what they wanted to do
4699308 nobody believes in us but us everyone is doubting us but we have nothing to lose
4699309 its an accomplishment to get through to the next round that was our goal at the pre olympics training camp held on the gold coast
4699310 were not letting teams execute the half court and that is the key for australia if we try to play a half court game against european teams well get hammered
4699311 we took a soft approach inside against those two teams and backed off
4699312 we talked about everything comes down to respect and i thought the defensive end of the floor today was key
4699313 we have been waiting for this opportunity since the last olympics
4699314 there are only so many games that come up like this and we were ready for it
4699315 a few times there were some little flare ups but it was all about things being intense
4699316 now we have a chance of miracle on ice or whatever you want to call it
4699317 my path has taken a lot of turns and there has been a lot of adversity but i think a common theme is making the most of my opportunities
4699318 for sure there was a little disappointment being a northern california guy and following the niners
4699319 that was an opportunity that looked like it would be a good fit
4699320 i cant complain about where im at im in a very good situation here in green bay
4699321 i couldnt let that distract me i understand how they feel
4699322 theyre emotionally involved and this has been difficult for everyone involved the fans the coaches our team in general
4699323 im not sure how i felt right at that moment
4699324 not if you handle it correctly which aaron has done
4699325 this is something that i caught onto just before 2000 when there was so much search engine craze running around and started doing small just to test things at first but which i later expanded on after getting the hang of it
4699326 ive actually gotten over 87 million in advertising that using my secret i never had to pay for and the largest share of which was more recently in google pay per clicks as well as other forms of pad advertising at search engines all of which i got for free

4699331 it was not quite what i had expected but athens was an awesome time
4699332 our disappointment in 2004 has really given him a lot of motivation to continue
4699333 he looks fantastic and he should be a strong medal threat
4699334 i went to watch him compete at the olympic trials and it was definitely bittersweet
4699335 i got to go to the olympics i got to dive with my brother not many people get a chance to do that
4699336 the olympics is i dont want to say a once in a lifetime opportunity because people can go more than once but it was definitely a lifelong goal
4699337 it was a great run not sure i was quite ready to give it up but when my guard unit offered me the opportunity to come to pilot training i could not turn that down how many folks get to fly f 16s
4699338 i spent my entire life getting ready for seven seconds of competition that is pretty much what we do every day here flying f 16s
4699339 you never know when you will be called to go do your job
4699340 generally it is in a split second when you need to pickle off a bomb or strafe a target diving definitely lends itself to what im doing now
4699341 i kind of just of knew that is what i really wanted to do
4699342 but i got really sidetracked over the next 15 to 20 years
4699343 it was not making the team in 2000 i just missed it that made me really sit back and reevaluate what i wanted to do with my life
4699344 that itch to be a fighter pilot had never gone away so i started taking private flying lessons
4699345 it took me 20 years to make it to the olympics
4699346 it might give me a chance to dive with my brother again i would really enjoy that
4699347 the olympics was fantastic but im not disappointed that i gave up the opportunity to go again in 2008 to do this i would say that this might even be better
4699348 yet another example of irresponsible publicity hungry security researchers trying to grab a few headlines

4699363 it went perfectly the race was just the way i wanted it it went out slow playing to my kick
4699364 but with three laps left i just didnt have it
4699365 my legs i dont know if it was the heat
4699366 and i think part of it was i may have been a little dehydrated by now i should have known better
4699367 just like a race car every now and then you get a little bit of engine trouble or the tires arent working right or out of balance
4699368 im not going to let the race results spoil my olympics experience just to make it here was a great feat ive got two or three days here with my family and im going to make the best of it

4699378 there may have been multiple positions which were reclassified but they all appear to have been held by just one trader and this was a very special trader with an enormous concentration of positions in crude oil amounting to perhaps 460 million barrels and not much interest in anything else
4699379 this reclassification issue highlights the fact that improvements are still needed in the area of data collection and that the agency does not yet have the comprehensive data we need to make any declarative statements about the overall role of speculators in commodity markets

4699402 i think particularly the families but the whole community of western australia would desperately want to see those horrific crimes solved and whoever committed those crimes locked away forever

4699408 ultimately this will allow us to create better biofuel crops
4699409 right now about half of the biofuel crops dont have genomic databases and the ones that do are in many different places and are annotated differently which makes it difficult to compare and use the information
4699410 our biofuel genomic database portal will include information on any crop that can be used to produce cellulosic ethanol including all the grasses such as corn rice maize wheat and other biofuel species such as poplar willow and pine
4699411 this will save researchers a lot of effort so we expect it to be a valuable resource for scientists at msu and around the world
4699412 cellulosic biofuels offer one of the best near to mid term alternatives we have on the energy production side to reduce reliance and imported oil and cut greenhouse gas emissions while continuing to meet the nations transportation energy needs
4699413 developing cost effective means of producing cellulosic biofuels on a national scale poses major scientific challenges
4699414 and these grants will help in developing the type of transformational breakthroughs needed in basic science to make this happen
4699415 nobody knew how this mechanism worked before we described this protein
4699416 this protein directly affects photosynthesis and how plants create biomass stems leaves and stalks and oils
4699417 weve found that if the tgd4 protein is malfunctioning the plant then accumulates oil in its leaves
4699418 if the plant is storing oil in its leaves there could be more oil per plant which could make production of biofuels such as biodiesel more efficient more research is needed so we can completely understand the mechanism of operation
4699419 we applaud tyra banks and the cw for making this historic visibility of transgender people possible

4699426 the formation of dead zones has been exacerbated by the increase in pollution fueled by riverine runoff of fertilizers and the burning of fossil fuels
4699427 from 1970 to 1990 the hypoxic zone on the northwestern continental shelf of the black sea has expanded to 40 000 square kilometers 15 500 square miles
4699428 however since 1989 the loss of fertilizer subsidies from the former soviet union reduced nutrient loading by a factor of two to four with the result that by 1995 the hypoxic zone had gone
4699429 climate change also has the potential to expand naturally occurring omzs oxygen minimum zones into shallower coastal waters damaging fisheries and affecting energy flows in the same way that eutrophication driven hypoxia does
4699430 an appropriate management goal would be to reduce nutrient inputs to levels that occurred in the middle of the past century before eutrophication began to spread dead zones globally

4699495 once i was able to compare them side by side to other specimens in our collections it was clear that these birds were special you of course have to be cautious but i was still very excited at the prospect of possibly having found a new species of bird

4699551 the clear language of the artistic license creates conditions to protect the economic rights at issue in the granting of a public license these conditions govern the rights to modify and distribute the computer programs and files included in the downloadable software package the attribution and modification transparency requirements directly serve to drive traffic to the open source incubation page and to inform downstream users of the project which is a significant economic goal of the copyright holder that the law will enforce

4699586 the water compact that colorado and other upper basin states have with california and arizona should be renegotiated

4699588 the colorado river compact allocates 7 5 million acre feet of water to california nevada and arizona anything left over is split between colorado utah new mexico and wyoming
4699589 scientists have predicted a 10 to 30 percent reduction of water flow in the colorado river due to long term drought and higher temperatures associated with climate change in the southwest instead of threatening a diminishing resource it would be better to help states and communities with water conservation projects and stream restoration

4699595 the research of dr ringrose who works at the institute of education in london and whose conclusions have just appeared in the times educational supplement could hardly be more timely coming at a moment when there is growing anxiety about the sexualisation of girls and women
4699596 called for teachers to discuss feminism and suggest positive role models who could include figures such as virginia woolf suffragettes leader emmeline pankhurst and even the cartoon character lisa simpson but the study also found that while girls rely on their sex appeal to create their identities they tend to see themselves and others as slutty if their behaviour goes too far dr ringroses research published in the times educational supplement comes at a time of growing concern over the sexualisation of childhood through teen magazines advertising films and music videos ministers have launched an inquiry into the commercialisation of childhood and teachers leaders have warned that highly sexualised clothes and toys are being marketed at primary school children
4699597 in recent years women in algeria egypt morocco and tunisia have secured more rights greater access to education and a modest increase in their political representation
4699598 to guarantee and consolidate the gains of the last few years we must follow through with the application of the reforms

4699612 the united kingdom as a witness to the green tree agreement attaches great importance to the successful and peaceful implementation of this agreement which implements the judgement of the international court of justice
4699613 the british high commissioner to nigeria bob dewar represented the uk at the ceremony in calabar on 14 august which transferred authority in the bakassi peninsula
4699614 we commend the continued commitment of the united nations to this process and the diligent work of the un secretary general his special representative for west africa the chairman of the follow up committee and the cameroon nigeria mixed commission in facilitating this peaceful settlement
4699615 what would have been of very serious concern is if the boundary covered the entrance to the calabar channel but it does not the calabar channel is still under our command we have control of our own territory
4699616 there is a clause in the green tree agreement that says that merchant ships can have right of way when passing through the cameroonian section but that war ships will not right now that is what is happening
4699617 the war ship of another country cannot pass through our own territorial waters without clearing from us that is the same thing if our war ships want to pass through cameroonian waters
4699618 bakassi is no more part of our territory so we cannot pass through there without getting clearance from them cameroon
4699619 if they come into our own territory we will challenge them likewise if we go into their own territory they will challenge us
4699620 the number of cybersquatting disputes filed with the world intellectual property organization wipo in 2006 increased by 25 as compared to 2005 in a related development the evolution of the domain name registration system is causing growing concern for trademark owners in particular some of the effects of the use of computer software to automatically register expired domain names and their parking on pay per click portal sites the option to register names free of charge for a five day tasting period the proliferation of new registrars and the establishment of new generic top level domains gtlds the combined result of these developments is to create greater opportunities for the mass often anonymous registration of domain names without specific consideration of third party intellectual property rights while electronic commerce has flourished with the expansion of the internet recent developments in the domain name registration system have fostered practices which threaten the interests of trademark owners and cause consumer confusion practices such as domain name tasting risk turning the domain name system into a mostly speculative market domain names used to be primarily specific identifiers of businesses and other internet users but many names nowadays are mere commodities for speculative gain
4699621 the rate at which domain names change hands and the difficulty to track such mass automated registrations challenge trademark owners in their pursuit of cybersquatters
4699622 with domain names becoming moving targets for rights holders due consideration should be given to concrete policy responses

4699630 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4699631 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4699632 they accepted the ruling because it was not the human eye making the judgment
4699633 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4699634 there is no doubt the question was for him to share or not to share first place there is no doubt the first arrival was michael phelps
4699635 in the old days the judges ruled now its the timers
4699636 technology is also imperfect the hand is quicker than the eye
4699637 they couldnt believe phelps got there and im sure ill feel the same way
4699638 there hasnt really been an error in the timing system that ive ever heard of the scoreboard said i got my hand on the wall first
4699639 im not about fighting it im not angry at all
4699640 people will be bringing this up for years saying you won that race
4699641 if we got to do this again i would win it
4699642 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4699643 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4699644 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4699645 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4699646 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4699647 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4699648 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4699649 graduation prom everybody wants to see the senior year so its gonna
4699650 but when were down 6 0 it was like ok this is going to be a pretty gnarly comeback if were coming back from this
4699651 i take the time out at 6 2 and i believe we are going to make a side out to get to 7 2
4699652 i see myself leading 9 4 10 5 12 6 its an easy end of the set normally
4699653 down 6 0 and storming back to 7 7 and then winning
4699654 i dont know if ive ever seen anything like that
4699655 they call me the professor or whatever but theres really no way to explain making a shift like that you can try to do your best to mentally make that shift but
4699656 i dont know how many other games are like this but this game is such a mental swing game
4699657 dolosa y negligentemente ha ejecutado una pol tica abusiva y dominante al permitir mundialmente durante mucho tiempo el uso de programas sin licencia para cautivar a los usuarios y despu s obtener de ellos un r dito econ mico exorbitante incurriendo en monopolio
4699658 las razones de catedral podr an considerarse en el mbito legislativo para modificar la legislaci n vigente pero no justifican el uso sin licencias en el r gimen actual
4699659 la tecnolog a inform tica se ha convertido en una necesidad social primaria para el individuo y las instituciones pero algo semejante ocurre con otras creaciones intelectuales tecnol gicas muy difundidas tambi n protegidas por el monopolio temporario que justamente fomenta su desarrollo
4699660 los programas de computaci n son obras susceptibles de propiedad intelectual en favor del autor
4699661 no existi un ejercicio abusivo del derecho por parte de microsoft ya que simplemente pretende cobrar por la obra intelectual utilizada sin permiso
4699662 no es il cita ni justifica violar la propiedad intelectual
4699663 inmediatamente despu s de la carrera tuvimos una protesta de la delegaci n de serbia cuestionando la llegada y afirmando que su nadador hab a sido m s r pido
4699664 seg n nuestras reglas revisamos imagen a imagen el video de omega y estaba muy claro que el nadador serbio tocaba segundo despu s de phelps es evidente que uno est braceando y el otro est volando de acuerdo con nuestras reglas usamos el sistema autom tico de cronometrar y el sistema en este caso estaba en perfectas condiciones en perfecto orden y no hay duda
4699665 despu s de ver el video nos reunimos con los serbios para darles una explicaci n y ofrecerles a ellos la imagen porque no hab an tenido la oportunidad debido a que antes las reglas no se lo permiten
4699666 police also confirmed it has been aired to 700 people as part of the inquiry but never released publicly as part of the investigative strategy until now due to concerns that to do so would narrow the focus of the inquiry
4699667 the claremont murders were one of the great tragedies of western australia and i live in claremont its my electorate i know the families i know the effect on them and i know the effect on the surrounding community
4699668 if it can help solve those crimes i would want all television outlets to have that footage
4699669 i think particularly the families but the whole community of western australia would desperately want to see those horrific crimes solved and whoever committed those crimes locked away forever
4699670 the basic difference between the lives of men and women is of course that men have to compete with other men for status so as to be chosen by women whereas women do not have to compete with other women because what allows them to be accepted by the men they choose are their given attributes of youth and beauty
4699671 the mayors team would like to see prosecutors remove perjury charges from the table let the mayor plead to misdemeanors step down as mayor and agree not to run again
4699672 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4699673 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4699674 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4699675 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4699676 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4699677 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today

4699684 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4699685 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4699686 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4699687 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4699688 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4699689 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4699690 this is a planning took where all things are going
4699691 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4699692 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4699693 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4699694 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4699695 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4699696 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4699697 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4699698 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4699699 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4699700 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4699701 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4699702 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4699703 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4699704 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4699705 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4699706 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4699707 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4699708 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4699709 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4699710 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4699711 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4699712 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4699713 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4699714 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4699715 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4699716 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4699717 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4699718 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4699719 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4699720 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4699721 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4699722 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4699723 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4699724 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4699725 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4699726 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4699727 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4699728 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4699729 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4699730 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4699731 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4699732 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4699733 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4699734 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4699735 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4699736 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4699737 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4699738 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4699739 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4699740 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4699741 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4699742 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4699743 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4699744 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4699745 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4699746 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4699747 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4699748 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4699749 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4699750 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4699751 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4699752 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4699753 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4699754 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4699755 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4699756 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4699757 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4699758 the editors and assistants of farrar straus and giroux received an upsetting e mail yesterday morning from the venerable publishing houses director of operations informing them that the water in their building on 18th street was being shut off until the following day the building manager had reported unanticipated problems but a promise was made that they would be resolved very soon
4699759 it will attempt to circulate two proton beams all the way around the ring on 10 september
4699760 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4699761 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4699762 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4699763 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4699764 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4699765 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4699766 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4699767 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4699768 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4699769 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4699770 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4699771 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4699772 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4699773 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4699774 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4699775 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4699776 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4699777 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4699778 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4699779 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4699780 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4699781 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4699782 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4699783 that your submitted photo has been selected for inclusion in the newly released fifth edition of our schmap nice guide
4699784 i was a little nervous i didnt know if my legs were going to be under me
4699785 i felt a little flat the past couple of days because i cut training really drastically to just try to recuperate and give myself as much energy as possible
4699786 that plan worked and none of the others known to have fallen ill was showing any long term effects
4699787 we all had at least one day where we werent feeling all that well
4699788 i think its maybe a combination of people brushing their teeth with the water the long travel just a bunch of things
4699789 trotters american teammates in the 400 sanya richards and mary wineberg as well as pole vaulter jenn stuczynski said they were fine
4699790 i did ok today not really so good or so bad
4699791 he was concerned that her teammate huang shanshan fell late in her routine and did not advance huang was doing quite well before failing to connect her eighth and ninth elements
4699792 my teammate is out and its disappointing because i lost a comrade
4699793 its a relief when you have a teammate with you now i am alone
4699794 i did not even know what it was all about
4699795 for the last month i have been training all alone
4699796 i know some of my teammates have fallen ill and it just happened
4699797 borchin said he hadnt had any positive tests and repeated he hadnt been in contact with kanaikin
4699798 im not sure whats going on i barely saw any of my teammates before i came so i dont know anything about it
4699799 borchin shrugged off the negative attention to win in 1 hour 19 minutes 1 second
4699800 obviously the others had more experience than i have me but i was fortunate today
4699801 a silver medalist at the 2006 european championships borchin withdrew from the 20k race at world championships last august at the 14 k mark because of heat exhaustion perez struggled saturday with the heat collapsing near the track after the race and needing treatment for dehydration
4699802 i want to thank god for the opportunity to be in five olympic games and to end my career like this
4699803 silver is not bad but silver is silver sometimes i heard an athlete say silver tasted like gold but to me silver is silver and bronze is bronze
4699804 tallent was happy with bronze his first major medal but concerned about the doping issues in russia
4699805 its an issue probably an issue in one country we know what country
4699806 i guess theyre trying to do the best they can the testers youve just got to hope for the best for the people that are clean
4699807 tallent said hed heard reports that kanaikin tested positive and found it strange that there was no clear idea of what was going on
4699808 it was strange maybe they were dodging it a bit because theyre under a bit of pressure with the accusations that have been going around
4699809 there can be no liberty for a community which lacks the information by which to detect lies
4699810 faceless for centuries the filipino has worn a succession of masks imposed on him by alien intruders no one really knows the depths of his confusion and bewilderment no one can truly measure the intensity of his hurt and shame a moving shadow he drifts aimlessly feeling unworthy of his own true self he embraces other peoples values and claims them as his own
4699811 they are a harmless nondescript people and nation with no particular offensive qualities and no reason to bother anybody they never cause concern in any way at all what i want to know is how the fuck did they manage it what genius
4699812 the act of selecting analyzing and writing about the past it is something that is done that is constructed
4699813 young filipinos would at once see in any straight translation from the spanish that they do not exist within the novels pages filipinas of course appear but they are exactly what todays filipinas are not pure blood spanish creoles
4699814 the evil that men do lives after them the good is oft interred in their bones
4699815 even to his enemies he is the greatest man of the malay race
4699816 there is in aguinaldo a most serious cause for concern you must know that the insurrectionary movement is nor only nationalist it is above all socialist and revolutionary the people did not want the spanish exploiters anymore they do not like the americans any better who have fooled them and dream of enslaving them ill say more they no longer want any masters of any kind so much so that they being victorious over the americans they would take advantage of this victory to the limit we would then have a kind of socialist republic a number of young men who studied in europe brought back the socialist doctrine with them do we have to cite luna who frequented the socialist clubs in spain for a long time sandiko who was a propagandist in america paterno a poet a fanatic and what is more frightening still is that those who surround aguinaldo want to imitate the great french revolution and are inspired by its spirit the day after the proclamation of the philippine republic the newspaper in support of the president published the declaration of the rights of man and the citizen you may be sure that they want to follow the examples of 1789 and 1793 right to the end since we prefer to live under american domination rather than be ruined and stripped by a socialist republic since we have the instinct of self preservation which is not really surprising we wish for no more than an honorable modus vivendi from the representatives of the united states
4699817 colonialism and colonize in other words have become codewords for any relation involving exploitation although authors who use them thus acquire certain rhetorical advantages typical of using politically correct and politically fashionable terms they also create serious problems as well in particular as sara suleri and chandra talpade mohanty point out such rhetorical and metaphorical uses of terms involved with colonization unfortunately 1 turn away from the specific historical realities of colonialism and post colonialism and 2 thereby falsely imply that we know all there is to know about these realities particularly 3 that all colonialism and colonization was pretty much the same

4699829 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

4699831 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4699832 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4699833 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4699834 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4699836 het volkskrantblog leidt regelmatig tot onverwachte verschijnselen zo heeft ook goedmakers vaker nieuwe toepassingen bedacht van dit blog hij poneerde een tijdlang stellingen waarop anderen konden reageren via het aanbevelingssysteem dat we hanteerden en nu kopieert hij een idee van de bbc door fotos z nder een onderschrift te plaatsen en zijn bezoekers uit te nodigen om daarbij het bijschrift te bedenken ik vind dit mooie ontwikkelingen ze tonen voor mij aan dat het volkskrantblog een eigen leven begint te leiden en dat het zich een plaats verovert in het leven van de gebruikers
4699837 de hecho lo platiqu el otro d a con n stor de la torre con mis compa eros del cuerpo t cnico y les comentaba que me gustar a que el equipo tomara un ritmo importante porque eso te permite que cuando las cosas van fluyendo se presta para que se les d arrope a los muchachos y que sea una cuesti n positiva

4699839 me la juego con j venes soy un convencido de ese trabajo en fuerzas b sicas la directiva tiene toda la confianza depositada en un servidor porque saben que puedo sacar este proyecto y ang lica fuentes la semana pasada dio todo su apoyo al trabajo que se est haciendo pese a que los resultados en ese momento no se nos estaban dando
4699840 se vuelve a repetir lo del torneo pasado chivas es el primer en repetir esta situaci n de la regla del 20 11 no me sorprende me gustar a en lo personal que todos los equipos la cumplieran en la fecha cuatro o cinco esto habla de que nuestra instituci n ha estado haciendo bien las cosas en las fuerzas b sicas donde se ha hecho un trabajo muy importante lo cual me deja satisfecho
4699841 es un equipo que el torneo pasado nos toc perder con ellos el sistema que manejan es el mismo aguantan bien y saben muy bien atacar no van a salir a proponer van a esperar m s as es que tenemos que aprovechar las pocas o muchas oportunidades que se nos presenten

4699857 our party speaks for human freedom for the sweep of liberties that are at the core of our existence we do not shirk from our duties to preserve freedom so it can unfold across the world for yearning millions we believe that lasting peace comes only through strength and not through the goodwill of our adversaries we have a healthy skepticism of government checking its excesses at the same time were willing to harness its energy when it helps improve the lives of our citizens we have pretty strong notions that higher tax receipts are no inherent right of the federal government we respect the values that bind us together as families and as a nation i believe that god put this land between the two great oceans to be found by special people from every corner of the world who had that extra love of freedom that prompted them to leave their homeland and come to this land to make it a brilliant light beam of freedom to the world

4699859 we lived together two families under one roof my parents had eight children my uncle and aunt had seven but even my uncles children called my parents father and mother it was a joint family but with only one patriarch and one matriarch my parents we all abided by that rule
4699860 my uncle was a doctor who headed emergency services at the hospital each morning my father gave him a ride to work but if he wasnt ready my father would take off without him
4699861 everyone knew my uncle he was a fantastic doctor but he was also my friend and a fun guy to be with
4699862 just as my uncle slipped the gloves on the phone rang he grabbed it then an orderly rushed over with a requisition my uncle was talking rapidly on the phone signing papers giving orders to a nurse one man is still saying ah and the other poor man is on his knees what excitement i was hooked
4699863 my uncle asked for lighter duty and was sent to a small village i went there during summer recess every morning i would see a line of camels with drivers to pick up my uncle for house calls
4699864 at that time if you were diagnosed with cancer you went home covered yourself with a sheet and waited to die
4699865 i was a kid from india what did i know but next to mahatma gandhi the greatest person i could think of was abraham lincoln so i chose lincoln hospital in the south bronx
4699866 i had never seen african american or hispanic people and here i was trial by fire at lincoln hospital taking care of their sick babies
4699867 i went from treating kids of working poor blacks and hispanics to a mercedes benz world of wealthy anglo saxons

4699870 i had left a cutting edge research environment but when i tried to initiate research programs in india well it seemed that nobody really cared
4699871 i had two patients with the same cll diagnosis one had been coming to brookhaven for 12 years and he was doing fine the other diagnosed only a year before was practically at deaths door
4699872 i got the medical records of our cll patients and began reviewing them
4699873 i studied the summaries so obsessively that my associates joked dont go down that hall theres a crazy indian staring at the walls
4699874 i left brookhaven in 1970 returning to long island jewish to dr sawitskys department where i continued to work on the staging theory it took me another year before everything fit into place so we wrote a paper and submitted it to blood

4699920 he drove this cheap datsun pickup with sticky notes posted all over the car like little reminders almost to keep track of the stories he was telling
4699921 he drove this cheap datsun pickup with sticky notes posted all over the car like little reminders almost to keep track of the stories he was telling
4699922 and he boasted of having all this stuff i thought he was cheap
4699923 like how he thinks about me often and how he would love to get together again
4699924 it was not handwriting it was block writing it was consistent but weird
4699925 he tried to date all the young girls in san marino and i wondered how he got the trust of our fathers and other men in san
4699926 i said hes creepy dad theres something wrong with him
4699927 he was always nudging either myself or my husband to invest in this or that
4699928 he wanted us to foot the bill for bringing the stones over
4699929 my husband thought it was kind of a cute scheme we kind of chuckled about it because his schemes were so grandiose
4699930 i was under the impression that he didnt even have a place to live
4699931 he wouldnt tell us where he was living hed say he wasnt at liberty to say because after all he was occupying someone elses place
4699932 the only suspicion i had was that he wasnt really wealthy like he said he was
4699933 he would show up to my house sometimes at dinner time hungry
4699934 i saw an area of dirt that had obviously been dug up and filled in recently
4699935 we have had no formal complaints but we are sending a team to investigate initially they will ascertain the level of the sound and whether it is a statutory nuisance before taking further action
4699936 it is like feedback but it is continuous i like to look at the stars at night and i can always hear it suffolk homes
4699937 when he realized what he had done jimenez told detectives he tried to hang himself with a belt
4699938 because he couldnt stand the sound of her crying which interrupted his video game
