630000 it seems that the market the aggregate of speculators at a given instant can believe in neither a market rise nor a market fall since for each quoted price there are as many buyers as sellers
630001 clearly the price considered most likely by the market is the true current price if the market judged otherwise it would quote not this price but another price higher or lower
630002 oh stocks were down today because housing starts fell last month
630003 stocks went up because mortgage loan demand was higher than expected in august

630005 happy employees dont necessarily create better financial results but there is a definite link between engagement and a companys financial performance
630006 the notion of engagement is really a dollars and cents issue organizations that have employees that are highly engaged deliver better financial results than those that dont
630007 are looking for a greater demonstration of senior managements interest in their day to day work
630008 what employees are looking for is open communication communication that reflects the fact that senior management really understands how the work gets done and recognizes and appreciates that
630009 including organizations willingness to help employees balance work and activities outside of work to sponsor competitive benefit programs to focus on career development and training
630010 those are things that will translate to employees as senior management being interested in my well being
630011 ceos who will provide a monthly web cast or a voicemail just letting people know about key developments in the industry and in the company those are some of the things that help employees put at least a voice and a face to senior management
630012 its not to say the manager isnt important but imagine the best manager in the world working in an organization that doesnt have a good performance management system doesnt have good advancement opportunities

630031 its fantastic an incredible feeling winning here in finland means so much to me
630032 i desperately wanted to win this rally getting a win here was more important to me than just getting points
630033 its been a very hard battle with mikko all weekend with no chance to relax he did a great job ive had to fight for every second
630034 im pleased with the speed we had but seb was able to find a few more seconds and in the end thats all he needed to win

630041 who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross
630042 the divine life force which brings all creatures into existence must constantly be present within them were this life force to forsake any created being for even one brief moment it would revert to a state of utter nothingness as before the creation
630043 there is an effect something that humans are and have to be but this is not an essence nor properly a thing it is the simple fact of ones own existence as possibility or potentiality
630044 i call all knowledge transcendental if it is occupied not with objects but with the way that we can possibly know objects even before we experience them

630049 not just ottawa mommy ottawa is our nations capital ive been to other capitals but not our nations capital i think i really need to go to our nations capital i am seven after all
630050 hes a special player a special talent and since i havent seen what he can do on the field yet im kind of eager for camp to get started
630051 i think everybody is looking forward to seeing what he can do and were excited about that
630052 i think we all know terrelle is a heck of an athlete and were all pretty energized about getting to camp since well get the chance to see what he can do first hand
630053 i think for a long time hes been hearing from everybody about how great a player he is and how he should come into college and be a star right away and all
630054 he cant listen to all that hype or let all the attention affect him like every other guy hes got a tough few weeks ahead of him when we start camp his focus needs to be on that
630055 i think i am as anxious as anybody to find out what kind of things terrelle can do for us
630056 its not a matter of what position he plays or what year in school a player is
630057 we still havent got to camp so its early but terrelle has demonstrated that he is a very hard worker and a young man who wants to learn as much as he can if he deserves to rotate in there at quarterback then thats what well do right now i can tell you he has demonstrated a desire to be the best quarterback he can be and thats exciting for us
630058 i think this is an ideal way for a young man like terrelle to come in
630059 but hes a competitor so even though terrelle has boeckman in front of him he is going to compete studying the game and in the back of his mind he probably feels he can get in there and compete i would try to use his talent the best way i could to help the football team
630060 i would not sit him down because any more if you do that you never know what is going to happen with that kid you might only get two more years
630061 woody probably would do it like he did with art schlichter 1978 81 schlichter was also a number one recruit coming out of high school and woody played him the very first game art schlichter ended up being a fabulous football player at ohio state
630062 gt b gt hall of fame shouldnt be without these bengals
630063 why not basket ball is really behind the indians in popularity too this is a football town were the browns the name on the door is cleveland
630064 that ball was 92 mph down and away and he shoots it out to right field when guys do that for you you have to come through i walked out on the field and felt this is our night
630065 david works as hard as anyone and he cares as much as anyone
630066 he didnt play a lot last year hes getting pitches to hit but hes just a tad off hopefully he can start squaring some of those balls up
630067 when you get older you start to wonder hey have i lost my mojo
630068 i shaved my mustache got a new glove got a tip on the breaking ball and im throwing the ball better
630069 the ball ate me up it hit me on the wrist with elijah dukes running it had to be perfect
630070 theres no one better than brandon that shocked us all
630071 the ball ate me up it hit me on the wrist with elijah dukes running it had to be perfect
630072 theres no one better than brandon that shocked us all

630075 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
630076 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
630077 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
630078 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
630079 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
630080 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
630081 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
630082 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
630083 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
630084 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
630085 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
630086 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
630087 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
630088 naomi went from one doctor to another in america pulled all her contacts and did not take no for an answer my daughter saved my life
630089 i try to abide by rules and regulations if you break the law then you must pay the penalty and i think naomi understands that very well herself

630117 puur voor de lol een rondje rennen dat lukt me niet meer
630118 sport is gezond topsport niet in de loop der jaren heb ik behoorlijk wat blessures opgelopen een beschadigde schouder kapotte knie n en een permanente verkromming van mijn rug de rest van mijn leven moet ik daarom dagelijks een half uur strekoefeningen doen om soepel te blijven als kind werd ik veel gepest met mijn magere lange lijf ik wist niet hoe daar mee om te gaan anders dan met agressie e n verkeerd woord en ik sloeg erop alleen in het sporten kon ik mijn emoties op een positieve manier kwijt achteraf gezien was dat mijn redding want zonder sport was ik misschien niet zo goed terecht gekomen eigenlijk wilde ik profvoetballer worden boksen deed ik erbij als extra training toen ik ontdekte dat ik daar meer aanleg voor had heb ik 100 voor het boksen gekozen niet zozeer omdat ik dat leuker vond maar omdat ik dacht dat ik er meer succes mee kon behalen het boksen confronteerde me op een heel directe manier met mijn lichaam als je traint m et je wel constant naar jezelf kijken mijn negatieve zelfbeeld draaide zich vanaf dat moment om in plaats van iets ongemakkelijks waar ik me onzeker over voelde werd mijn lichaam een instrument om mijn droom te verwezenlijken op het hoogste niveau zijn alle sporten zwaar maar boksen misschien extra omdat het een contactsport is het maakt je lichaam n g kwetsbaarder natuurlijk ben ik wel eens bang geweest heel vaak zelfs maar dat is juist goed het houdt je scherp in beweging wat dat betreft is boksen een metafoor voor het leven in beide moet je optimaal in balans blijven om zo min mogelijk klappen op te lopen of ik ijdel ben absoluut elke bokser is trots op zijn lijf hij smeert zich in met olie toont zijn lichaam aan het publiek dat heeft zelfs iets sensueels maar het gaat dieper dan alleen het uiterlijk gezondheid fitheid prestaties die dingen maken er k onderdeel van uit helaas zien de meeste toeschouwers dat niet topsporters koesteren hun lichaam maar tegelijkertijd zijn ze er ook heel kritisch op het gevaar bestaat dat het nooit goed genoeg is je kunt letterlijk verslaafd raken aan het trainen zelf ben ik wel eens een periode overtraind geweest dat ik eigenlijk niet meer kon stoppen gelukkig had ik een coach die me op tijd terugfloot in 1992 ben ik min of meer van de ene op de andere dag gestopt met boksen ik studeerde sportmanagement en zat continu met mijn neus in de boeken in de weinige vrije uurtjes ging ik met vrienden uit eten of naar de kroeg binnen een jaar zaten er flink wat extra kilos aan dat voelde niet lekker het past gewoon niet bij mij zon log lichaam sindsdien heb ik er altijd voor gezorgd dat ik fit en op gewicht ben gebleven voor de buitenwereld zal ik waarschijnlijk altijd die bokser blijven maar zelf zie ik mezelf allang niet meer zo mijn voldoening haal ik nu uit heel andere zaken mijn werk als personal coach en mijn gezin daarbij maak ik natuurlijk wel gebruik van de kennis en ervaring die ik als topsporter heb opgedaan als ik daar n ding aan heb overgehouden dan is dat een fit lichaam de basis vormt voor een gelukkige geest een positieve energieke lichaamshouding maakt dat je je goed voelt over jezelf en dat je vol vertrouwen met de klappen van het leven kunt omgaan
630119 mijn hele sportcarri re heb ik met mijn gewicht geworsteld
630120 als kind al wilde ik overal de beste in zijn toen dat op school niet lukte stortte ik me helemaal op de sport eerst voetbal later ook volleybal en roeien voor iedere sport trainde ik drie of vier keer per week daar kwamen in het weekend dan nog de wedstrijden bij in combinatie met school was dat best veel ja al snel bleek dat ik met roeien boven de rest uitstak vanaf dat moment wilde ik maar n ding de top te bereiken ik was al veel met mijn lichaam en mijn gezondheid bezig maar dat werd toen nog een graadje erger ik schreef bijvoorbeeld alles op wat ik at dat werd dan later door mijn begeleiders geanalyseerd zodat ik waar nodig mijn dieet kon aanpassen vanaf mijn achttiende trainde ik tien tot twaalf keer per week dat heb ik ruim twintig jaar volgehouden blessures heb ik amper gekend omdat ik fysiek sterk ben maar zeker ook omdat ik altijd op tijd mijn grenzen heb aangegeven als ik grieperig was trainde ik bijvoorbeeld niet hoe vervelend dat ook voor de rest van het team was ook belangrijk ik zorgde ervoor dat er m r was in mijn leven dan alleen sport tussen alle trainingen en wedstrijden door heb ik mijn studie bewegingswetenschappen afgerond en ik ging bijna elke week wel een keer uit met mijn vrienden natuurlijk moet je lichamelijk in goede conditie zijn maar als je geestelijk niet in balans bent kun je nooit de top bereiken mijn mazzel is geweest dat ik altijd een goed evenwicht tussen de twee heb gevonden een paar jaar geleden ben ik uitgeroepen tot succesvolste nederlandse roeier ooit maar er is n ding dat blijft knagen ik heb nooit alleen een grote prijs gewonnen jarenlang heb ik met dat doel getraind maar ik was fysiek gewoon niet sterk genoeg eerlijk gezegd zit dat me soms nog steeds dwars de beste zijn in een eenmansboot is en blijft de ultieme prestatie sinds 2000 roei ik geen grote wedstrijden meer maar de obsessie met het sporten met mijn lichaam die blijft ik train drie vier keer per week ik eet gezond mijn gewicht is nog hetzelfde als twintig jaar geleden en ik drink weinig alcohol dat is een tweede natuur geworden sterker nog ik moet me fysiek fit voelen om in het dagelijks leven goed te kunnen functioneren voor een belangrijke vergadering ga ik vaak een uurtje sporten het maakt me letterlijk en figuurlijk sterk puur voor de lol een rondje rennen of roeien lukt me helaas niet meer ik moet altijd een doel hebben recent heb ik me ingeschreven voor de halve marathon en ik roei nog regelmatig wedstrijden met de oudolympische equipe die drang om me te willen bewijzen gaat nooit meer over ik heb een hoop opgegeven voor mijn sport maar ik heb er niets voor hoeven laten dat is een belangrijk verschil want als je het gevoel hebt dat je iets mist win je nooit aan de andere kant heb ik met al mijn successen natuurlijk makkelijk praten die medailles op de olympische spelen voelen toch als een soort rechtvaardiging voor de buitenwereld maar vooral voor mezelf al die duizenden trainingsuren zijn niet voor niets geweest
630121 de openingsceremonie van de olympische spelen in 1996 was het mooiste moment mijn hele sportcarri re meer nog dan het winnen van al mijn titels de emoties daar waren zo overweldigend duizenden sporters van over de hele wereld die allemaal vier jaar naar dat ene moment habben toegewerkt dat k n je gewoon niet onberoerd laten vier jaar eerder zou ik eigenlijk ook al gaan maar een paar weken van tevoren raakte ik geblesseerd aan mijn enkelbanden vanuit mijn ziekenhuisbed heb ik alle wedstrijden gekeken vreselijk balen natuurlijk maar toch kon ik me gauw over de teleurstelling heen zetten ik concentreer me in het leven liever op wat w l lukt een echt afgetraind sportlijf heb ik nooit gehad op mijn vijftiende moest ik van de sportarts zestig kilo wegen maar lager dan 64 kilo kwam ik niet ik vond eten gewoon te lekker bovendien als ik niet regelmatig chocolade at werd ik onuitstaanbaar dat is trouwens nog steeds zo in tegenstelling tot veel andere meisjes uit de selectie ik heb er een paar een echte eetstoornis zien ontwikkelen heeft dat me nooit onzeker gemaakt je kunt altijd een groter shirtje aandoen toch dat ik aan mijn sportcarri re geen complex heb overgehouden betekent trouwens niet dat ik niet let op wat ik eet net als alle andere vrouwen in de wereld vind ik altijd dat er wel iets af mag ik heb nu eenmaal aanleg om snel stevig te worden sinds ik in 2000 ben gestopt met tennissen is er 4 5 kilo aangekomen net iets teveel naar mijn zin vandaar dat ik met een aantal vriendinnen een weddenschap heb lopen om er een paar kilo af te krijgen of ik bang was voor de extra kilos van mijn zwangerschap helemaal niet maar ik ben waarschijnlijk een van de weinige vrouwen die na haar zwangerschap minder woog dan ervoor dat was het gevolg van een afkeer van zoetigheid en van relationele problemen 28 jaar lang heb ik bijna continu spierpijn gehad zodra ik stopte met tennissen wat die ineens over ik was vergeten hoe heerlijk het is om s ochtends zonder kramp in je benen naar de badkamer te lopen daar kan ik nog elke dag van genieten zodra ik mijn laatste wedstrijd had gespeeld was ik er ook echt klaar mee maar ik vond het wel moeilijk dat ik opeens geen reden meer had om s ochtends mijn bed uit te komen ik heb me daardoor een tijd behoorlijk verloren gevoeld tot ik voor de tennisbond aan de slag kon in het coachen heb ik een heel nieuwe vorm van voldoening gevonden als topsporter leef je met oogkleppen op je moet wel want afleiding is funest voor je prestaties terugkijkend vraag ik wel eens af hoe ik dat volhield ik heb bijvoorbeeld vijftien jaar geen sociaal leven gehad ook geen relatie mannelijke tennissers hebben vaak een vriendin die overal mee naar toegaat andersom werkt dat niet zo daaraan ben ik dus pas veel later toegekomen tennissen doe ik helemaal niet meer maar ik ben wel drie keer per week in de sportschool te vinden om fit en op gewicht te blijven natuurlijk maar ook omdat sporten me blij maakt als ik met een rotbui een uurtje ga spinnen voel ik me daarna honderd keer beter bovendien kan ik al mijn woede en frustraties erin kwijt sporten maakt me een aardiger en evenwichtiger mens

630124 uiteindelijk komt alles nu ook af alleen met minder stress
630125 in al die jaren heb ik nooit getwijfeld of ik de juiste keus had gemaakt nou ja die ene keer dan toen ik na een auto ongeluk acht jaar geleden in allerlei nare bureaucratische procedures verzandde in een crisissituatie worden de cultuurverschillen enorm uitvergroot je weet niet hoe dingen werken tot wie je je moet wenden normaal kan ik me prima redden in het italiaans maar opeens kwam ik woorden tekort intu tief wist ik dat men misbruik maakte van de situatie en ik kon er niets aan doen dat machteloze gevoel was vreselijk toen wilde ik dat ik in nederland was maar gelukkig is het bij dat ene moment gebleven
630126 matthijs en ik hadden ons leven in nederland goed voor elkaar beide een vaste baan als journalist bij een krant een mooi huis in den haag en drie gezonde kinderen toch besloten we in 1993 te vertrekken naar een oude toscaanse boerderij zonder elektriciteit riolering telefoon of warm water een duidelijk idee wat we gingen doen hadden we niet de meeste achterblijvers verklaarden ons voor gek maar het was een goed doordacht besluit ons leven was geweldig maar ook overvol ik voelde me altijd opgejaagd op kerstavond 1992 stond ik half overspannen achter het fornuis matthijs lag ziek in bed op tafel een grote stapel cadeautjes klaar om ingepakt te worden binnen een paar uur zou diezelfde tafel vol gasten zitten teveel doen in te weinig tijd zoals zo vaak ik werd overspoeld door heimwee naar itali naar de camping in toscane met de grote houten buitentafel waar we altijd mochten aanschuiven voor het eten daar voelde ik me thuis daar kwam ik tot rust op dat moment wist ik we gaan verhuizen we vertrokken niet alleen maar met drie jonge kinderen of dat het besluit lastiger maakte helemaal niet maar dat wil niet zeggen dat het altijd makkelijk voor hen is gewest de oudste marije had in het begin heel veel heimwee en marijn begon nederland enorm op te hemelen daar hadden ze tenminste normale huizen met verwarming en licht en allemaal mooi speelgoed naarmate ze ouder werden zijn ze het leven hier gelukkig meer gaan waarderen
630127 vooraf hadden we tegen elkaar gezegd dat als we het eerste jaar maar doorkwamen we een goede kans hadden om het te redden helaas bleek dat nog niet zo simpel het huis regeerde ons hele leven stond in het teken van de verbouwing tijd om geld te verdienen was er nauwelijks terwijl er m r dan genoeg dingen waren om het aan uit te geven het dak moest bijvoorbeeld met spoed vernieuwd met als gevolg dat we de eerste winter met sneeuw in de woonkamer zaten het was zo koud dat we met zn vijven in n bed sliepen om warm te blijven warm water hadden we niet dus we wasten onszelf in een cementkuip die we met keteltjes gekookt water vulden en dan heb ik het nog niet eens gehad over de muizenplaag of de elektricien zonder elektriciteitsdraad of de eindeloze hoeveelheden gruis en stof en spinrag financieel hebben we het heel zwaar gehad als er niet af en toe wat hulp uit nederland was gekomen hadden we het niet gered en nog steeds is het niet makkelijk het gebrek aan geld maakt ons wel creatief ik heb geloof ik al vijftien jaar geen nieuwe meubels of kleren gekocht maar met gebruikte spullen kun je ook veel doen de auto die niet wil starten doet het wel als je hem met een tractor aantrekt en eten doen we van ons eigen land nederlanders noemen ons leven soms armoedig maar zelf voelen we dat helemaal niet zo het is maar net wat je belangrijk vindt alleen voor de kinderen was het af en toe lastig als ze de nieuwste gadgets of schoenen niet konden krijgen gelukkig kregen we gaandeweg steeds meer journalistiek werk en we verdienden wat bij door nederlanders te adviseren bij het verbouwen van hun huis in toscane zo redden we het uiteindelijk altijd toch
630128 ergens wonen is heel wat anders dan er op vakantie zijn het is een gewenningsproces dat veel verder gaat dan alleen het leren van de taal ik denk dat elke emigrant een soort identiteitscrisis doormaakt het effect daarvan mag je niet onderschatten je moet een nieuwe persoonlijkheid voor jezelf cre ren zonder de zekerheden van je vertrouwde omgeving want die ben je kwijt dat is zwaar maar als het je lukt geeft het zoveel zelfvertrouwen ik doe nu dingen die ik in nederland nooit gedurfd zou hebben ruzie maken met een boze ambtenaar tussen wildvreemde mensen dansen op een dorpspleintje de halve wereld over reizen voor een interview ik draai er mijn hand niet meer voor om waar ik het meest aan heb moeten wennen is de italiaanse omslachtigheid sterker nog die went nooit een italiaan zal niet iets makkelijk doen als het ook moeilijk kan mensen laten je rustig drie keer voor niets komen en niemand vertelt je iets je moet lles zelf uitvinden dat is soms om gek van te worden aan de andere kant maakt het je wel inventief toen marijes nieuwe school een officieel bewijs wilde dat ze naar groep vier mocht heb ik haar oude directeur in nederland een prachtig document laten opstellen met handtekeningen van de tuinman van de gymleraar en stempels van de melkunie dat ging erin als koek is het leven in itali extra moeilijk voor ons effici nte nederlanders ja en nee in het begin heb ik mezelf wel eens voorgehouden dat ik veel te praktisch was dat ik dat moest afleren onzin natuurlijk want dat kan helemaal niet na vijftien jaar in itali ben ik nog steeds effici nt maar op een andere manier ik heb mezelf aangewend in een rustiger tempo te werken en dingen te durven laten liggen uiteindelijk komt alles nu ook af alleen met minder stress
630129 ik wist dat de man vrouwverhouding in itali veel traditioneler is dan in nederland toch keek ik in het begin raar op als de aannemer of notaris alleen met matthijs zaken wilde doen en dat terwijl mijn italiaans veel beter was dan dat van hem maar in de loop van de tijd ben ik de duidelijke rolverdeling tussen mannen en vrouwen juist gaan waarderen je weet precies waar je aan toe bent als werkende vrouw in nederland moest ik alles kunnen nu kan ik me zonder g ne richten op de zorg voor het huis en de kinderen niet dat ik niet meer wil werken dat doe ik nog steeds met plezier maar er is minder druk op komen te staan een leuke bijkomstigheid is dat matthijs veel meer man is geworden in nederland lachen ze hem uit als hij zich macho gedraagt hier wordt dat juist gewaardeerd het legt nogal wat druk op een relatie samen opnieuw beginnen in een vreemd land maar matthijs en ik zijn er als stel alleen maar sterker uitgekomen als we al woordenwisselingen hebben gaan die altijd over ons werk nooit over het leven hier we hebben een natuurlijke taakverdeling gevonden die ons allebei heel goed bevalt en net als de italianen maken we elkaar regelmatig complimenten wat zeker helpt is de enorme ruimte het is zo groot hier dat ik vaak niet eens weet waar matthijs precies is op een bovenhuis in florence waren we waarschijnlijk allang gescheiden
630130 wat ik zo leuk vind aan italianen is dat ze meer complimenten geven dan nederlanders men heeft aandacht voor elkaar er heerst altijd een positieve sfeer zelfs gewone dingen worden op die manier heel speciaal het betekent wel dat alles v l tijd kost even boodschappen doen kan hier alleen in de supermarkt voor andere inkopen moet je uren uittrekken de markt is een soort buurtcentrum iedereen kletst kijkt verlekkerd in elkaars tassen en maakt afspraken voor etentjes reuze gezellig het nadeel is wel als je je te snel uit de voeten maakt lig je eruit vrienden maken is in itali veel gemakkelijker dan in nederland de zuidelijke hartelijkheid bestaat cht zelfs als je iemand net kent word je binnengehaald alsof je familie bent en italianen staan altijd voor je klaar middenin de nacht een probleem je kunt je buurman rustig uit zijn bed bellen en hij komt nog ook misschien dat onze kinderen in de toekomst een tijdje in nederland gaan wonen maar ik kan me niet voorstellen dat matthijs en ik ooit nog teruggaan ik ben een boerse vrouw geworden die op het land werkt en naar de lucht tuurt om te zien wat voor weer het morgen wordt de rust en de ruimte hier zijn zo geweldig ik geniet nog elke dag intens van het grote niets om ons heen teruggaan naar een wereld waar het uitzicht niet verder reikt dan het volgende huis en waar altijd iets moet boezemt me angst in ren e wees als een kind zo nieuwsgierig durf vragen te stellen en kijk vooral veel af van de plaatselijke bewoners zo leer je het snelst wat ook helpt je aansluiten bij een club of vereniging speel je viool schilder je graag gebruik dat dan om contact te maken niet alleen met andere buitenlanders maar juist ook met mensen uit de buurt en realiseer je je denkt misschien dat je veel weet maar in de praktijk weet je niets je kunt geen grotere fout maken dan een italiaan vertellen hoe je pasta moet koken laat hem het jou leren en je hebt een vriend voor het leven
630131 ik denk vaak met vermaak terug aan de verbouwing van ons huis in den haag twintig jaar geleden dat zou nu zo veel gemakkelijker zijn bouwtechnisch heb ik in itali echt alles uit de kast moeten halen een gevels restaureren een betonplaat storten een trap maken ik deins nergens meer voor terug vroeger liet ik me altijd leiden door wat ik kende nu laat ik me graag verrassen met een andere aanpak als die dan lukt ben ik extra trots
630132 nederlanders praten veel meer over wezenlijke dingen dan italianen ook met hun kinderen die zijn daardoor veel zelfstandiger als italianen van school komen weten ze totaal niet hoe de wereld in elkaar steekt ze zijn volkomen afhankelijk gemaakt ze blijven dus thuis wonen en kunnen niet voor zichzelf zorgen onze ouders wilden juist dat we zo snel mogelijk dingen zelf deden ze gingen regelmatig weg voor hun werk en dan regelden wij alles natuurlijk miste ik ze maar ik voelde me wel heel zeker omdat ze zoveel aan ons overlieten
630133 we waren anders en dat vond ik niet leuk vanaf het moment dat we in itali woonden wilde ik liever italiaan zijn het leven in twee werelden lijkt rijk maar als kind voel je je verloren tussen de verschillende culturen dat geldt des te meer als je heel armoedig woont terwijl de italianen om je heen hun zaakjes goed op orde hebben ik kan niet zeggen dat ik mijn ouders als losers zag maar het lag er wel dicht tegenaan als ze in nederland waren gebleven was al dat gemodder niet nodig geweest
630134 in de toekomst zou ik wel een tijdje in nederland willen wonen dan ga ik alles met de fiets doen want dat kan hier niet ik geniet van de dingen die in nederland heel gewoon zijn het water de bruggetjes het vlakke land maar met de mensen zou ik meer moeite hebben italianen beschouwen je eerder als familie ook al ben je dat niet echt je hoort er direct bij nederland is rijker in de zin van geld en spullen maar de mensen kijken je eerder raar aan als je niet precies doet wat ze verwachten

630242 since this will be a series that will be shown everyday makikita natin dito lahat we will see what happens to the contestants not just while they are doing the stunts but also before and after the stunts malalaman natin yung mga takot nila and televiewers will be able to relate to them
630243 there are stunt rigs that are readily available there the crew is waiting for us to begin shooting soon they are very well versed with the stunts and with the safety issues sanay na rin sila pagdating sa coverage ng show
630244 may mga makikita tayong stunts na nagawa na sa fear factor na gagawin din sa pff hollywood in style pero pinoy ang gagawa may mga stunts naman na galing din sa south america they are all safe naman we are going there to ensure the safety of the stunts
630245 the contestants came from diverse backgrounds we believe that the viewers will be able to identify with each one of the contestants ang mga pinoy kasi matatapang by nature tinignan lang namin yung contestant kung paano siya mag react sa fear at paano nila io overcome yung fear na yun
630246 pinoy fear factor will give us an entertainment value of a reality action packed show i believe the filipinos are ready for this kind of show ratings wise maganda naman yung pagtanggap ng mga pilipino sa fear factor
630247 though here in swiss and in europe all workers in the film industry media even hairdresser to aide in the kitchen gets formation to get a license they are paid well and not abused by employers you are right theres so much bureaucracy that goes with licensing but we have to start somewhere to discipline ourselves our government offices our leaders etc
630248 i dont think we need to take it to the level of licensing artists what will be your criteria for licensing education what about the artists who learned from the bottom up and didnt study in any formal school what makes a director what makes an editor a person can know all the textbook terms and processes but still not be a director
630249 fine line there between regulating professionals and regulating artists the latters dangerous ingats lang
630250 mukhang tax ang makakalaban nila pero di ako masyadong sigurado sa magiging impact baka mas makabuti ito in general
630251 yes the industry needs this licensure exams so the exams should be made by scholars and practitioners alike license can protect professionals from pseudo artists there is no law in the philippines protecting the artist and in turn the movie stage advertising industry i had been a victim of abuse on numerous occasions and i know there have been others abused among production crew and even directors

630285 later today we will have to consider the best way forward for the england team he said
630286 michael has been the most successful test captain england have ever had the critical thing is that we will be sitting down with michael and the selectors to plot the way forward it was a significant blow to lose the series to south africa
630287 it was desperately disappointing we had high hopes after two wins in two previous tests against new zealand so clearly the selectors will be talking this through we have an incredibly important 12 months ahead of us

630310 the theory of evolution seems to me quite powerfully sacrificial darwin stresses the importance of death just as much as the importance of survival in some sense it is representing nature as a super sacrificial machine
630311 i claim that religion protects men and societies from mimetic escalation religion has an adaptive value but this is not enough it is also the source of hominization of the differentiation between animals and human beings because through sacrifice it creates culture and institutions
630312 one can argue that many groups and societies perished and were destroyed by lethal infighting by the explosion of mimetic rivalry being unable to find any form of resolution the scapegoat mechanism provided a fundamental contribution to the fitness of the group this is the reason why such a practice is found throughout the world this is the result of a form of systematic selection which lasted thousands of years it was the scapegoat mechanism and subsequently religion which provided that fundamental instrument of protection against natural instraspecific violence that any group of hominids primates is bound to trigger at some point for purely ethological behavioural reasons
630313 when two geese approach each other showing signs of hostility most of the time the common aggression is redirected and discharged against a third object this redirection of aggressiveness has been crystallized by evolution in an instinctual pattern which can create a bond through a kind of incipient scapegoating mechanism even if it isnt proper to call it scapegoating since the third element often is an inanimate object one can see here the first sketch of future scapegoating very much in the sense of redirecting violence onto a third party this observation if correct could account for the emergence of a bond among individuals who together scapegoat a third party a victim the redirection of the inner aggression of a specific group against an external element or an internal element perceived as external which is expelled creates a strong cohesion within the group itself
630314 to have a common symbolic or real scapegoat is the most efficient mechanism to reinforce friendship
630315 there are forms of collective violence present in these groups of chimpanzees there are also forms of hunting with ritual aspects therefore the are clearly signs of the emergence of the scapegoat mechanism this is another stage of the long evolutionary process that led to the scapegoat mechanism
630316 l anguage and the symbolic sphere could only be generated by a systemic catastrophe one cannot explain taboos prohibition and the complexity of symbolic exchange systems simply via biological explanations of the emergence of unselfish behaviour there must be that upheaval there which forced the change in behaviour the same reasoning can be applied to language the only thing that can produce such a relational structure is fear fear of death if people are threatened they withdraw from specific acts prohibition is the first condition for social ties and the first cultural sign as well fear is essentially fear of mimetic violence prohibition is protection from mimetic escalation all these incredibly complex phenomena were triggered by the founding murder by the scapegoat mechanism
630317 i believe that one starts treating animals like human beings in order to sacrifice them doesnt bode well for my dog t here is no incentive directly related to domestication and its advantages since no one knows about them at the start and they will only become evident as time goes by
630318 d omestication could not have been foreseen nor even planned
630319 there were also massive ritual killings of human beings because the process of animal substitution in ritual sacrifices never occurred
630320 could have given to the human being the idea of putting seeds into the ground they buried them hoping they would resurrect like the community as a result of sacrifice and they werent wrong
630321 why was this behaviour reinforced and hence selected for if it was not offering adaptive rewards surpassing those accruing to hunter gathering or foraging communities
630322 became reinforced because it has a sacrificial origin the hunter gatherers started to settle permanently because of the increasing importance of ritual sites and the complexity of the rituals of which they were part and which in turn produced as i said the domestication of animals and the discovery of agriculture
630323 converts the gesture of appropriation into a gesture of designation that is into an ostensive sign that comes to designate the object rather than attempting to capture it
630324 in order to believe it you must believe that there has been violence before the previous violence has produced fruits of awareness of its consequences

630441 the lamps are going out all over europe we shall not see them lit again in our lifetime
630442 the demand for high end accommodation has risen driving up rental prices which can be partly explained by companies expanding their operations in singapore together with government initiatives to attract skilled workers from overseas
630443 but at the same time the supply of property available has been limited by a number of factors such as en bloc purchases by developers which has exacerbated the situation
630444 while accommodation costs in singapore have increased considerably over 12 months it remains a competitive location for companies moving staff into the region since accommodation is one of the largest costs borne by a company when moving staff overseas
630445 exchange rate fluctuations also play an important role when making direct comparisons of residential property to let between cities worldwide
630446 when using the u s dollar as a point of reference it is not surprising that rental prices have gone up in locations like singapore where the local currency has strengthened against the dollar however this makes rental rises in hong kong where the currency is pegged to the weak u s dollar all the more significant
630447 on average rental prices in asia are approximately usd 3820 well above the global average of usd 2950
630448 a robust economy and increased demand for high end accommodation have been instrumental in driving rental prices up
630449 while prices in beijing are likely to rise sharply this year due to the olympics the effects of this are unlikely to be long lasting and rents after the games should return to their normal levels

630460 most vehicle crime is opportunistic and results from criminals spotting security weaknesses
630461 i bought a coat for five shillings 25p that was grey with a blue fleck and wore it with a turquoise dress and a pair of lovely navy blue shoes with a bow on the front that vic had got me from wilsons shoe shop in the old arcade where the mander centre is now
630462 money is no guarantee of happiness weve shared everything and been very happy
630463 i left school and wanted to study business my dad was doing an mba in business administration at the same time as i started my hnd
630464 and it inspired me to carry on get more worthwhile qualifications and get to where i wanted to go
630465 all the way through it was a huge success and every step has been brilliant
630466 to help ensure the accurate reconstruction of this much loved local building which we saved from demolition we are keen to hear from anyone with family connections or memories of the shop
630467 throughout its life in hall street the distinctive shop has been extensively developed and modernised
630468 we need to know what the shop looked like in 1935 and hope that photographs of the inside or outside from the last 70 years will help us piece together its history
630469 we are also looking for information about the shop next door which was once ashmores tailors
630470 we just concentrate on keeping locals how local people like them
630471 we are not a tv pub or anything flashy like that we just give people what they want we are opening pubs while everyone else is closing them down so we must be doing something right

630478 i feel really alive again when id been feeling so dead now im in control of the pain again
630479 youre just being selfish do what i say or youll be sorry
630480 murderous cleansing has been moving across the world as it has modernized
630481 fling it on to the bed by the mother so violently that he might have broken its spine
630482 giving birth to their babies in the privy and treating the birth as an evacuation some of the women killed their children in a very crude way by smashing their heads
630483 it is extremely rare for a german lady to nourish her own child
630484 he would not eat if she did not give up her disgusting habit
630485 one rarely encounters a german infant who is fully breast fed
630486 the wretched new born little thing has been wound up in ells of bandages from the feet right and tight up to the neck as if it were intended to be embalmed as a mummy
630487 babies are loathesome foetid things offensive to the last degree with their excreta and the heads of the poor things are never washed and are like the rind of stilton cheese with dirt encrusted upon their skull
630488 rarely could we eat a piece of bread without hearing fathers comment that we did not merit it
630489 exclusively described as screaming and the mother told to remain hard and relentless
630490 after a few nights the child will understand that its screaming will have no effect and is quiet
630491 consistently repeated until the child calms down or falls asleep for then one is master of the child forever from now on a glance a word a single threatening gesture is sufficient to rule the child
630492 dressed up in terrifying costumes as the so called knecht ruprecht made their faces black and pretended to be a messenger of god who would punish children for their sins
630493 hairy monster that chased me under the living room table chains clanking hoofs stomping appearing it wanted to drag me off in its carrying basket the korb
630494 suggest the brutal contrast between the experiences of central european working class children in the late nineteenth century and the dominant ideals defining childhood in other nations
630495 one feels sorry for these little german children they must work so hard and seem to lack that exuberance of life spirits and childish glee that makes american children harder to train but leave them the memory of a happy childhood
630496 at some point in the future so starting a preventive war was
630497 sacred union we are no longer what we had been alone
630498 a beast of a thousand heads that crushes anything it cannot swallow
630499 to exterminate undesirable children who were late in being toilet trained or had used dirty words
630500 youll be eaten by lice youll rot in your own shit
630501 the jews are like the lice of civilized mankind somehow they must be exterminated or they will invariably resume their tormentive and molesting role
630502 antisemitism is exactly like delousing the removal of lice is not an ideological question but a matter of hygiene
630503 it is commonly known that typhus and other infectious diseases are spread by the jewish population
630504 youll be eaten by lice youll rot in your own shit all are going to die
630505 by exterminating the pest we shall do humanity a service
630506 this is a death camp youll be eaten by lice youll rot in your own shit you filthy shitface
630507 guard with a big clock whom the germans dressed as a rabbi and called the shit master
630508 the german warrior always carried with him the spirit of his loving mother and her eyes shone on him even in death
630509 seldom had a nation so readily surrendered all its rights and liberties as did ours
630510 a sheer magnitude of antisemitic violence greater than in any other city of the reich
630511 85 percent of austria still showed some degree of anti semitism and 20 percent said that auschwitz had its positive aspects
630512 aw demause come on thats too simplistic just love your children and youll eliminate wars you expect me to believe this
630513 for network rail to become truly accountable we must all be given the right to become individual members as a genuine mutual venture it would be structured so that we all have a voice it would allow us to democratically elect a members council which would have powers over the appointment and pay of network rails board

630515 we have found that what applies to animals also applies to humans
630516 maltreatment may lead to lesions and deficiencies in the structure of the brain
630517 my grandfather smoked all his life but never got cancer and he was over eighty when he died
630518 i was beaten as a child and i turned out perfectly fine if scientists say spanking may lead to brain damage theyre also saying that it may not
630519 dont be distressed if you find yourselves involuntarily giving your children a smack its something your hand learned very early on it happens almost automatically and you can usually limit the damage by recognizing that you made a mistake and admitting your error but whatever you do dont ever tell your children you hit them for their own good if you do you will be contributing to the perpetuation of willful stupidity and covert sadism
630520 in general im in agreement with you but i cannot endorse your efforts to get corporal punishment legally banned because it deprives parents of a way of instilling certain values in their children and i find that important my children are three and five and theyve got to learn what theyre allowed to do and what they arent if a law like that really got passed it might stop many young people from having children at all
630521 i cant remember its all such a long time ago but it must have been something serious because i can remember how my fathers face was twisted into a grimace my father was very fair so i must have deserved the punishment
630522 you say you were seventeen at the time and you cant remember what youd done all you can remember is your fathers face twisted into a grimace from that you conclude that your punishment must have been deserved but you expect your three and five year old children to internalize the well meaning principles you try to impress on them when you spank them what makes you think that a small child is better able to understand these lessons and get some good out of them than you were as an adolescent all a beaten child remembers is fear and the faces of the angry parents not why the beating was taking place like you the child will assume he had been naughty and merited the punishment what kind of beneficial pedagogical effect do you see in that

630597 a breezy writing style and a cool mix of tidbits
630598 whatever it is we do must have a foreign intelligence purpose
630599 even in pursuing this forreign intelligence purpose the law requires us to do everything reasonable to prevent us from touching communications to from or about americans
630600 i wont deny that the way the world communicates now there is the potential all the time of bumping into american communications to say that we do that intentionally would be absolutely wrong we try to safeguard against it in every step of the process respect what the law requires us to do which is to protect those communications protect the privacy rights of americans
630601 if were collecting against a person we believe to be a foreign target and turns out to be an american person that is someone who is protected by the fourth amendment we have to stop i mean its turn it off that is no longer a legitimate target if that happens to be collected and in the processing of the information we discover that that information must be destroyed
630602 i wouldnt wine about this personally but were a heavily tasked agency we cant afford ahh bumping into things that arent of foreign intelligence value or arent legitimate areas where we should be working
630603 by executive order it is illegal for us to ask others to do what we can no lo we can not do ourselves and we dont do it

630613 that at the beginning the creator made them male and female and said for this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife and the two will become one flesh so they are no longer two but one therefore what god has joined together let man not separate
630614 atlanticism as a sole historical principle has already had its day nato has failed to give new purpose to its existence
630615 you dont understand the real russia unless you read la russophobe
630616 very many arrivals from the near and far abroad work in the housing and public utilities structure
630617 migrants from tajikistan uzbekistan moldavia sic have to live someplace while theyre toiling here and the construction of a temporary village for them as it seems to us could solve this problem
630618 in the scales of a megacity construction of separate villages for migrants most likely will turn out to be a step towards ethnic quarters living their own life
630619 multi nationality dormitories could turn into a closed ghetto separate from the other part of the city with its own culture economy social relations and this will complicate even more the process of the assimilation of the arrivals in a society alien to them
630620 the problem is not just that the enclaves will turn into a kind of reservations living by their own laws
630621 such villages could turn out to be a real magnet for various extremist groupings those same skinheads will no longer need to ponder where to seek a victim it will be sufficient simply to come to an officially published address and the capitoline administration to my view will simply not be able in the current situation to ensure reliable protection to arrivals conflicts will be unavoidable
630622 in the prefecture of the central district for example they have proposed to lodge the migrants in evicted and semi evicted houses prior to their demolition
630623 and likewise in buildings undergoing reconstruction if these proposals are liked by the capitoline administration it is possible already in the nearest years a roof will appear over the head for migrants
630624 why limit oneself to the construction of houses only for natives of central asia
630625 in moscow there are enough labor migrants who have come to the capital from the regions they likewise are in need of improvement of housing conditions but the separation thought up by the muscovite powers could become an additional stimulus for hatred on the basis of nationality let this be small apartments in not the best districts of the city but accessible to both tajiks and let us say migrants from bashkiria and udrmurtia
630626 in samara now they are preparing to open a center for arrivals working in the sphere of construction and housing and public utilities
630627 it will represent a dormitory and at the same time play the role of a cheap income generating house for an insignificant payment migrants will be able to lodge in it for the time of work in the city
630628 so the total number of people who produce nothing and get their wages out of the russian state budget or from wealthy fellow citizens is 109 397 600
630629 the main thing that distinguishes us from other companies is the asymmetricality of our approach to problem solving and our non traditional ways with typical situations
630630 cooperation between the state and moslem organisations is managed at many levels and in a number of directions
630631 there will soon be no one left to work in the country up to 60 of russians are old people children and invalids of the 20 million people of working age about 1 million are in prison camps for various crimes 4 million are serving in the mvd mchs and fsb systems another 4 million are chronic alcoholics with a million drug addicts on top of that
630632 loss of healthy men is on a scale similar to the ussrs losses during wwii
630633 180 000 people die yearly in russia from the effects of harmful and dangerous manufacturing conditions

630639 should the appropriate political decision be made the tu 160 nuclear bomber and the tu 95 strategic bomber could refuel at one of cubas airfields
630640 russia is not building any military bases in foreign countries
630641 supposedly even though the event was horrible it wasnt typical for the country as a whole but i think otherwise i think it is typical and that there are more than enough events like this throughout the entire country they simply dont all fall into the mass medias field of vision
630642 there are thousands just like them all over russia they live in their cities towns and villages in general quite poorly there is often no electricity in their homes they travel on horrible roads and they vote in elections the way theyre told to they couldnt care less who is in power in the country the powers couldnt care less how they live or whether theyre even alive
630643 yes they often get detained by the police their animal instincts often dominate over their feelings i mean if they are hungry they can just take a bun from the shelf in a bakery and they will not think about consequences then again they are easily influenced if you are elder i mean if they take you for an adult and if you just offer them an apple or a chocolate bar they will do anything you ask for a thief might ask them to take the things out of someones flat and they would do it they cannot think
630644 this is pure politics if these athletes who are the main contenders for gold medals are forced out of the games the new favorites will automatically be the chinese

630667 he was supposed to be under 24 hour supervision and was to have two trackers if he left the property
630668 yet he was able to jump the fence into my property and stalk my five year old daughter for 10 days
630669 it was only because i am a protective mum anyway that i found out who he was before something happened
630670 when i did find out who he was and what he had done i hit the roof

630674 ya bagus lah kalau kpc menghentikan operasional namanya tahu diri tapi saya juga imbau anggota komda komite daerah aphi menahan diri dari kemungkinan berlanjutnya masalah ini
630675 prodisa sebagai anggota aphi sudah melapor kalau kpc ini masuk melewati kawasan hutan yang dikelola prodisa lalu kita lapor ke dephut yang langsung menurunkan tim terpadunya hingga keluarlah vonis kpc bersalah masuk areal konsesi prodisa
630676 masalahnya meski mengantungi izin awal kpc mengklaim sudah mendapat izin dephut sehingga masuk untuk menambang padahal izin eksploitasinya belum keluar karena izin pelepasan kawasan dari dephut setahu kami juga belum turun
630677 kita belum tahu prodisa mau bagaimana apakah minta ganti rugi atau apa tapi kamis arankan untuk diam dulu melihat kondisi di lapangan dan kebijakan pemerintah
630678 aphi juga usul agar menko perekonomian memanggil dua menteri terkait dan membahas masalah ini bersama sama karena terkait praktik dua sektor berbeda di lapangan yang sama kalau menurut kami pertemuan itu wajib terjadi
630679 pihak lain juga harus mentaati aturan main itu bagaimana mungkin pemantapan kawasan bisa tercipta jika diobok obok pihak lain yang tak ikut aturan main itu

630682 saya ini sifatnya hanya terjebak dalam situasi pada saat itu diminta sebagai saksi untuk penyerahan uang itu dari anthony dan disuruh membagikan uang itu kepada dpr

630722 today we have absolutely no concerns about the organization no regrets come the 9th of august the opening day of competition the magic of the games and the flawless organization will take over
630723 im not going to apologize for something the ioc is not responsible for
630724 we are not running the internet in china chinese authorities are running the internet in china
630725 i really do understand that the overwhelming majority of fans wanted so badly for me to succeed
630726 additionally i would like to sincerely apologize to those fans offended by my wrongful actions last saturday night it was an overreaction on my part to what i felt was a series of public inaccurate and unfair remarks about me
630727 while my nine seasons there were filled with personal highlights like hitting my 400th 500th and 600th home runs in a reds uniform and the negatives of having to fight through too many injuries my biggest regret is that we were not able to win a world championship while i was there
630728 i got the call at 9 30 a m and when your minor league manager calls you its one of three things youre either going up being released or being traded
630729 last year i struggled in tacoma waiting to get the call
630730 this year i changed my approach i decided not to look up here and just do my best ive been through this before brought up and sent down the bottom line is you still have to pitch well wherever you are ive worked hard ive competed
630731 with two lefties woods gives us the luxury of saving cesar jimenez until later in the game
630732 we talked about a number of pitchers in tacoma and from the information we got it was jake
630733 bunting is part of the game were trying to incorporate into yunis game
630734 i wondered over the last month whether he was 100 percent watching him throw because some of his throws werent getting to first base
630735 hes still the best shortstop in the league his offense needs work but his defense is so good that even when hes not at his best hes better than anyone else you can run out there
630736 were just trying to get through and run as well as we can
630737 here you just dont know things can go bad in a hurry
630738 we dont just sit back and run the same thing that we ran were constantly changing to find something that is a little better
630739 were in a points race with bernard so we have to beat them every time we match up we knew he was really fast but thankfully the oberto prevailed
630740 se pasa mucho tiempo juntos est s aislado del resto del mundo
630741 we may be using webcams and internet technologies but youre still trying to find that chemistry
630742 and if it isnt there you just move on to the next person
630743 if people decide they dont like someone they usually know within 30 seconds
630744 if you meet someone you like three minutes isnt long enough if you dont like them 30 seconds is too long
630745 if you see someone you like in real life you dont go up to them with your resume and compare you just talk
630746 i wanted to be a little ridiculous and put myself out there
630747 my mom said the more places you put your resume the better chance you have for finding a job i figured id do the same thing with dating
630748 eight to 10 of our users have been to real dating sites
630749 were more about meeting new friends not necessarily meeting new dates
630750 the dating stories are good to hear and weve got plenty of them
630751 the indian statement is not only surprising but shocking too
630752 there were also bombing incidents in pakistan subsequently but we have not pointed fingers at anyone as we believe in carrying out investigations before laying responsibility
630753 such baseless accusations serve no purpose other than vitiating bilateral atmosphere

630778 the world faces a global climate emergency it is now clear that only action by both developed and developing countries can prevent the climate crisis from deepening
630779 the aim is to limit global temperature increases to two degrees above pre industrial levels
630780 the time is right for the countrys private sector to show leadership by partnering with government to develop a solutions driven national climate change mitigation and adaptation response
630781 the cost of inaction far outweighs the cost of mitigating the effects of climate change
630782 our emissions per capita are higher than many other developing countries sas emissions per capita are also high due to our coal based energy system
630783 our analysis shows that putting a price on carbon has the single largest impact on emissions by using the price signal it sends signals to all actors in the economy and can shift behaviour

630823 what do you expect i mean were real people i have nothing bad to say about anybody
630824 something sexy and edgy something where i get to use a knife
630825 it was pretty much the same with the last record
630826 weve been working on acoustic guitars and then trying to bring it all together as a full band were not sure whats going to happen yet but weve been having a lot of fun we havent stopped writing songs since we stopped recording pretty odd because we have a lot to write about
630827 its sounding pretty awesome which is probably what were going to call the next record
630828 weve got quite a few new ideas and songs weve been working on and were hoping to record some of that stuff by the end of the year
630829 i can tell you its on our latest record its in the middle somewhere
630830 dealing with the press is something that youve gotta start getting used to
630831 and you know people want something to talk about so theyre going to have the two disney girls or three disney girls kind of feuding
630832 theres no feud theres nothing to feud about so why start a fight
630833 its something that we all have to live with and unfortunately it involves friends
630834 im not interested in being anybody but myself and im not here to replace anyone
630835 i think that shes a wonderful performer and of course its a compliment but i would like to take a different route
630836 i would love to step out of disney and maybe do a couple of roles maybe challenging roles and fun roles new things like that
630837 when i get older i will be stronger theyll call me freedom just like a waving flag
630838 and do you really want to hold my dirty hands
630839 we are always interested in any kind of workshop that is empowering and will encourage girls to feel like they can do anything
630840 they can create their own environment and be creative in the risks that they take
630841 if you can find other girls to play with its not just a bonding experience its not just about the music its sort of this big empowerment thing
630842 its a confidence builder youre playing and youre jelling together on a stage in front of people who are pumping you up and its just a really big empowerment and confidence booster
630843 we actually put a bunch of names in a little baggy and drew out four or five random words and put them together and we wrote down about 40 different possible names
630844 we were down to finding nowhere and broken media and we all voted for broken media
630845 total teenage drama its like us making fun of girls because we say they are talking on their cell phones listening to the radio looking in the mirror and trying to fix their hair

630849 i know people are expecting me to fill the shoes of nicolas anelka but its going to be difficult because he is a very good player

630851 i want to go to chelsea in the same wat that ronaldo wants to come to madrid it is the same thing
630852 ive talked with him and he knows perfectly that he is an important part of our plans
630853 he is a key player and we are not thinking about if he leaves or not
630854 we are looking for someone very physical who can play as a wide striker everyone likes david silva but he is too expensive lukas podolski is an excellent player but would not fit into our style of play
630855 im calm very calm i am waiting calmly to see what eventually happens the truth is that im happy

630894 the buy in by the community since the painted cave fire has been tremendous
630895 we can throw a bunch of people firefighters at a fire but if we dont have some safe areas to work out of youre going to lose some homes

630945 simpatica che non perde occasioni per fare battute dicesi anche battutaro di prima categoria ma anche gentile allegro solare divertente
630946 preferite che gli altri siano attratti dalla vostra personalit piuttosto che dal vostro aspetto questo non significa che non dobbiate mantenervi in forma ma che volete si sappia soprattutto che siete intelligenti
630947 felice del binomio spirito e corpo vivi con le giuste percezioni e con la consapevolezza di chi non ha nulla da invidiare a nessuno ecco perch appari sempre sicuro di te e delle tue azioni estroverso e spregiudicato sempre allaltezza dosato
630948 hai un carattere molto timido e introverso non aleggia in te nemmeno un briciolo di spudoratezza sei talmente distante da questo atteggiamento che ti sfugge persino il significato fai della riservatezza una ragione di vita non ti sbilanci mai e hai la rara capacit di mantenere sempre il controllo anche quando tutto e tutti ti sono avversi chi ti conosce davvero non ha dubbi in proposito
630949 riesci a far buon uso del linguaggio sei sicuro di te stesso e non parli mai a vanvera non fai del linguaggio una ragione di vita ma quando occorre sai spiegarti perfettamente hai la capacit di trovare le parole giuste quando la situazione lo richiede senza per questo scadere nella retorica un buon uso della dialettica condito dalla condizione di saper ascoltare moderato
630950 hai lambizione di crescere professionalmente del resto perch non dovrebbe essere cos ci non significa necessariamente che sei disposto a sacrificare ogni istante della tua esistenza per il lavoro hai linnata capacit di saperti adattare alle circostanze non esiti a sacrificarti per raggiungere ottimi risultati ma il tuo tempo libero e i tuoi interessi sono sacri composto

630952 i pensieri che corrono le frasi che segnano le emozioni che proviamo
630953 sei la persona pi tenera e dolce che abbia mai incontrato in questo mondo fatato
630954 le mie coccole sono per quella persona che quando ho iniziato con il blog mi ha insegnato ad inserire immagini scritte e come si pu parlare con la gente anche se in modo virtuale sono le coccole di un genitore a cui tu come figlio hai insegnato a passare qualche ora nel blog e a conoscere tanta gente stupenda forse virutale ma forse pi vera di chi ti pi vicino una forte stretta di mano
630955 non ho resistito alla tentazione e sono ripassata complimenti per il tuo blog mi piace moltissimo ho iniziato a leggere qualcosa e pi leggevo e pi avevo voglia di andare avanti proprio come un romanzo che ti appassiona
630956 lo sai forse il motivo del tuo successo che scrivi tanto ogni giorno hai un blog super aggiornato scrivi cose che vivi sulla tua pelle cose semplici della vita quotidiana le scrivi dettagliate con trasporto ed emozione sei sincero parli ai lettori con voce umile sei diventato un posto di ritrovo continua a tenerci compagnia ancora

630961 quando non mi senti parlare vuol dire che sto parlando dentro
630962 lamore e un incendio che ti sfugge dal controllo che non puoi pi domare che scoppia e non puoi spegnere e travolge tutto quello che trova intorno
630963 ma aldil delle frasi fatte che una donna vuole sentirsi dire correggetemi se sbaglio penso che non c bisogno di essere degli studiosi per far felice una donna no basta solo lamore e una volta tanto basta solo far parlare il cuore e dire qualcosa di carino ricordandosi sempre che il cuore a parlare perch lamore in fondo solo un incontro di emozioni nate pure e vitali nel nostro profondo e siccome penso che le donne vadano adorate e corteggiate ogni giorno e che ogni giorno vadano premiate per tutto quello che le donne fanno per noi maschietti per rendere loro il nostro grazie basta solo far parlare il cuore e allora si che una donna sar felice

630982 people will point to the last gp in germany and say it was obvious there were team orders in that event because it was clear heikki moved over and let lewis pass
630983 but the simple fact was throughout the race lewis was nearly seven tenths of a second faster and heikki was told that he was not told to let lewis pass
630984 but when youre in a team and you know your team mate has the opportunity to win the race and you dont if you have the right values that are not lodged solely and exclusively in your own motives and your own objectives and your own selfishness then you take a decision which is to allow the driver past and allow him a chance to win the race which is what he did

631013 i think no matter whether the quake has impacted us the torch should still come here
631014 of course he still thinks of his child in the evenings when hes alone he cries in secret but he thinks theres no way of seeking redress
631015 hes still supporting the olympics the kids were all so happy about it
631016 i am totally relieved this brings a lot of closure
631017 it may not have brought the closure that others may have wanted to see this person face justice as opposed to take his own life but i think they have the right person
631018 he fits the profile that we had advanced but they would like to see the evidence
631019 the family definitely wants to be able to see the evidence that the fbi has accumulated that theyre not just trying to make this guy a scapegoat allowing them to close their file and be done with it
631020 so we gather the facts and then we ponder the facts and we just wait and see what develops
631021 my head and my heart says that saying anything detrimental unkind toward this man only hurts his family because theyre the ones left to sort through and to wade through all of this
631022 we have to remember they lost someone they loved also
631023 those are the only times when i consider the fact that this is not normal
631024 this is not the type of person i was seven years ago
631025 it got a bit too far maybe it is such an issue at the moment in spain it gets a bit over the top
631026 a couple of our players they made the comment that there was only talk about him and not about the current team and stars and everybodys waiting for the next rumour without anything concrete
631027 i was upset but it wasnt like i was upset with shawn i was upset with my own performance because i had a little bobble in my routine
631028 i worked so hard that whole year to come back and i wanted to get my floor title back after not even making it to finals in 2006
631029 but if anything having her come in and being such a good competitor just pushed us hard to achieve more it was a motivational thing for me to work harder
631030 im personally glad it was now in 2007 because i knew i needed to go home and work harder and get up my level of difficulty to give her a good fight in
631031 its such a great accomplishment to have someone from your own country win the olympics but it was a little hard to watch as i would have liked to have been at that olympic games
631032 it was really hard it was a tough time i took some time off and that helped me to revive and made me realise that i do want to do gymnastics and keep training there were a lot of tears shed but made me stronger and i feel im a lot better competitor because of it
631033 a world medal is amazing but getting that olympic medal would just top out the world medal that feeling of winning a gold medal would be to die for that olympic medal might have to be in my room that ones mine
631034 your first game will catch the attention of the world and you must have confidence stay collected and play well
631035 no matter whether you win or lose above all do it with spirit
631036 use an outstanding competition to win honour for the motherland
631037 win respect win friendship show the spirit of the chinese people
631038 when i was young i was also a basketball fan i loved to watch basketball games most of all
631039 for me going three in a row i certainly realise the attention and expectation that comes with that
631040 but at the same time i probably feel more relaxed with this than i felt in the past two games
631041 touch wood everything is going according to plan this time i was always looking forward to these olympics and i have prepared myself physically and mentally
631042 there are so many rivals this time round and more depth than ever now you just have to go out there give it your best shot and the results will talk for themselves
631043 i am confident i can get the best out of myself i feel fit to race and look forward to doing everything correctly
631044 weve got to wait to see what will happen in the transfer market with regard to signing a new striker but what wayne did last season was staggering
631045 he had to take the responsibility of leading the line on his shoulders and he was awesome
631046 he played out of position a lot he played on the left and sacrificed himself so many times for the team
631047 i know the manager wants to see wayne playing in his more accustomed position just off the front

631053 nao vejo cartazes espalhados nas capitais da nacao com algo escadalizante e chame a atencao do povo como sou lavado com sangue tenho que pregar pra voce nao escuto nada com respeito ao movimento estudantil cristao dentro das escolas muito menos nas faculdades
631054 quando escuto sempre algo do tipo a fulana tava fazendo 4 anos de direito na faculdade federal no segundo ano resolveu ajuntar alguns amigos cristaos dentro de uma sala comecaram a orar a coisa foi crescendo at que chamou a atencao dos diretores e resolveram dar um auditorio claro n vieram as greves a escola parou por um pedaco pra falar a verdade vez ou outra entrava numa greve mas fazer o que faculdade aqui no brasil assim mesmo enfim ja tinham banda e tudo os jovens gostavam mas a ja era o terceiro ano o quarto ano chegou a fulana se formou e o ministerio acabou
631055 meditando de como a igreja brasileira tem cuidado dos seus jovens e sobre a atencao que ela tem prestado a eles concernente as suas tentacoes e as suas vontades confusas de de querer servir a deus sem ter medo de estar fazendo algo errado porque nao foi assim que a igreja ensinou o senhor falou comigo
631056 olha quando tava ainda nesse dia pensando sobre essas coisas pensei assim o jovem de hoje em dia nao encara as mesmas tentacoes que os jovens do passado um dia chegaram a encarar ou seja nossos avos encaram no sentido de que as tentacoes sao as mesmas em natureza mas completamente diferente em sua roupagem
631057 hoje em dia tudo ta depravado demais ate onde sei meu avo nao tinha acesso a internet para acessar sites pornograficos quando bem entedesse e ficasse assim de boas se meu pai fosse pego pelo meu avo com uma revista de mulher pelada com certeza ficaria na penitencia de ficar no minimo 1 semana ajoelhado no punhado de milho com as maos marcadas com o sangue que com certeza nao seria do cordeiro mas o proprio sangue dele espirrado pelas arrojadas varas de bambu criadas como muito carinho no quintal da casa dos meus avos para uma hora muito especial como esta
631058 nos estados unidos chamamos isso de updating quando os programadores fazem a atualizacao do sistema no computador para que sempre fique em dia com eventos atuais e nunca fique ultrapassado e fora de moda eles dizem que farao um updating no computador
631059 quando ouvia pregacoes de pastores a jovens sobre tentacoes ouvia assim busque a deus ele vai te ajudar entao sempre me fazia 2 perguntas
631060 deus me disse entao rafael se eu derramasse sore o brasil um mover novo em 1970 e isso se tornasse uma fonte de agua viva para muitas pessoas e essa geracao fosse educada sobre os ensinamentos dessa epoca e repassasse isso a outros de acordo como aprenderam com seus lideres de 1970 e os anos forem passando e a igreja brasileira nao for buscando uma atualizacao do meu
631061 a partir desse momento compreendi e tive a resposta das minhas famosas perguntas
631062 se a igreja brasileira encarar os jovens como jovens e nao como velhos darem um novo tipo de tratamento os entederem ve los de acordo com a atualidade nao como que nem meu tempo entao teremos uma ameaca na palma da nossa mao
631063 tem velho fazendo updating diario enquanto jovens deixam ser ultrapassados por eles mesmos

631065 i hope they can reach a solution that fits all parties and prevents the situation from deteriorating further
631066 the mistakes of politicians brought us to this stage our social fabric was torn up in kirkuk and this is very dangerous for all of iraq
631067 they have to settle all their differences otherwise it will lead to a crisis in all iraqi cities
631068 it was a democratic process why did they reject it
631069 we arabs are against any new resolution that could affect our presence in this city
631070 the mosque destruction reinforces muslim fears of seeing the league in the ruling coalition
631071 this place will be turned into a park and a car parking space and will be named after italian writer oriana fallaci
631072 to believe that a good islam and a bad islam exist goes against all reason
631073 we believe the life of italian muslims will get more complicated
631074 the mosque destruction is sign of spiraling islamophobia in many european countries
631075 but this friday i went to the mosque for prayers but i could not as it was razed
631076 we live in a state of anticipation and fear after the mosque was destroyed and we want arab and muslim governments to pile pressures on italy to stop anti immigrant and anti islam policies
631077 we want to tell the muslim world that mosques construction in italy is almost a mission impossible
631078 except for the milan based islamic center and the rome mosque there are no real mosques in italy
631079 the school foundation urged us to intervene to protect people
631080 many students suffered various injuries to the head others were burnt by molotov cocktails
631081 the assailant was a fairly large man who basically took this young boy by the hand and forced him into a private room where he subjected him to sexual contact
631082 the boy was at the mosque for some type of instructional classes
631083 im in shock i dont know what to really say it is very disturbing news
631084 i had no idea anything like this could happen with him well just have to wait and see
631085 we are milanese and we are not going to accept the solution thats being offered
631086 india has been suffering from terror attacks by islamic militants for many years the ahmedabad blasts that killed 45 people yesterday are not isolated there have been several other blasts that have taken place recently in jaipur bangalore and other places
631087 but what is of great concern to british indians is that there have been several reports of british charities sending money to pakistan that are being diverted to terrorism against india
631088 if i go to the uk as a cleric and tell people that islam is under attack i can come back with lot of funding
631089 we dont know who lives in legal nomadic camps let alone the illegal ones we dont know the nationalities of the residents so we have to do a census
631090 it incomprehensible why fingerprints are being taken solely from minors from this tiny ethnic minority
631091 all of this will not reduce fear and give peace to our people but set the stage for unearthing a type of xenophobia or worse of racial discrimination

631109 is it possible for us to witness a world without america and zionism
631110 todays situation is that neither the return of palestinians nor formation of a government and even the collapse of the zionist regime is unachievable
631111 the government has lost the philosophy of its existence and is no longer capable of implementing the policies of the united states and europe in the region
631112 more joint harmonization could be effective to continue bilateral ties on a suitable basis
631113 some countries want to create distance between iran and syria but they are making a mistake as the two countries will forever stay beside each other

631123 the great need of the disciples on this occasion was that they thought they could think and figure they did not believe or realize what kind of lord they had in christ it would be better for us to commend the whole matter to god and not think so much about needs
631124 due to the economy we are going to have to let one of you go
631125 i hope they can reach a solution that fits all parties and prevents the situation from deteriorating further
631126 the mistakes of politicians brought us to this stage our social fabric was torn up in kirkuk and this is very dangerous for all of iraq

631130 many parents are looking for ways to disconnect their kids from the electronic media that keep them indoors and reconnect them with nature and with each other
631131 fishing is an inexpensive and very enjoyable way to accomplish that but lots of parents havent fished for years they can come to our clinics and brush up on fishing techniques or even learn from scratch right along with their kids
631132 a lot of leaders of this community enjoy the benefits that the naacp made it possible for them to have but they are not members
631133 how can you forget the organization that helped you get where you are
631134 i told myself when i get to be a man ill live here
631135 im sitting here wondering will a matchbox hold my clothes
631136 i aint got no matches but i got a long ways to go
631137 i have struggled with my weight for my whole life and pregnancy obviously does crazy things to you
631138 so when my daughter was 3 months old i looked for a place she could be with me when i got in shape i never thought i could enjoy exercising
631139 my baby loves it near the end of the class we put the kids on a big mat where they can play together and interact
631140 my husband accepted a new job and we moved from baton rouge la where i was attending strollerfit
631141 i checked to see if there were any classes in this area and i couldnt find anything so i decided to open one myself
631142 we meet the needs of all fitness levels and incorporate music nursery rhymes and games into class to make it fun for both mom and baby
631143 strollerfit is a total body workout while building your mommy muscles you are also incorporating cardio strength and resistance
631144 the faster someone burns off the extra weight that most new moms carry the better but they should increase their activity level gradually
631145 if exercise isnt hurting you you can do almost anything that doesnt produce pain
631146 i had tried my local gym but my daughter hated their day care and it was a nightmare now she likes the floor exercises and plays while were in a circle around them sweating
631147 some of the very aggressive elements that ive outlined in my plan
631148 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good here and if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things that they dont like in exchange for moving us in the direction of energy independence then thats something im open to
631149 i wanted to send a strong signal that we cant allow partisan bickering or the desire to score political points to get in the way of providing some genuine relief to people who are struggling
631150 i want to be absolutely clear to everybody about this if i thought that i could provide you some immediate relief on gas prices by drilling off the shores of california and new jersey if i thought that by drilling offshore we could solve our problem id do it
631151 drilling provisions are about as careful and responsible as you might expect from a drilling agenda
631152 i also recognize that in the house and the senate there are republicans who have very clear ideas about what they want and at some point people are going to have to make some decisions do we want to keep on arguing or are we going to get some things done
631153 thats been a goal from the beginning its just a matter of getting the money
631154 its going to take a hell of a lot of money
631155 everyone in germany should at least one time in their lives pay a visit to the museum island in berlin

631157 educations purpose is to replace an empty mind with an open one
631158 they said they might not have lived if it hadnt been for the screening
631159 there is a business side to this health care costs are expensive and if we dont manage it they can get out of control
631160 this is a way to manage it and the side benefits to this are remarkable better morale and happier healthier people
631161 but then they started asking what are you doing in the area of wellness and they discussed different things people do there
631162 were seeing some fairly dramatic improvements in the health of employees
631163 so i can design wellness initiatives to help combat or improve those wellness scores
631164 this a strategy of chronic and regular communication and an opportunity for people to keep themselves healthier
631165 its a great service to our community and to our staff our employees cant get these kind of tests done for the price that mainland offers to us
631166 early detection is a huge factor in health and wellness
631167 our program is a win win because we are focused on the needs of both the employer and the employee
631168 health care is the largest cost of doing business today and employers are having to pay more
631169 what we do is say lets work together lets make the right things happen
631170 21 injured including six police in algeria car bomb attack
631171 there are just not that many civil lawsuits and they are not clogging the court system
631172 weve given her the space and the time that i think her performance level deserves well see her get here and again well be watching progress and see what happens
631173 i am more optimistic as time goes on ill wait and see where we are but as things positively progress thats good news
631174 well cross that bridge when we come to it its a team effort there are a lot of people involved in this coaches medics
631175 you sit down and say where are we are you capable of doing yourself justice if yes youve earned the place take it
631176 things are getting better and stronger but then of course they would through the passage of time
631177 the challenge shes taken on is a considerable one and its important for us to make sure that challenge is progressing not at the expense of her long term health and also to see how that challenge is progressing in terms of her getting towards good shape to be able to perform
631178 why i hate blacks at least those who perpetrate crimes against whites and those who do nothing to stop it
631179 the media and popular culture have been full of rampant anti male propaganda for decades
631180 insofar as there is any gender war going on feminists are the ones fighting it themselves
631181 but i might make a mistake giving up this man

631186 ein teil der b rgerrechtler meint die deutungshoheit ber die ddr errungen zu haben sicherlich keiner kann die stasi in der erinnerung ausklammern aber manchmal gewinnt man den eindruck dass sie heute gegenw rtiger ist als zur zeit ihrer existenz
631187 fr her geschehen wenn die menschen nur unter der knute gelebt h tten das leben funktionierte trotz all dieser widrigkeiten
631188 wenn man heute sagt jeder b cker der morgens um drei oder halb vier aufgestanden ist um p nktlich brot zu liefern oder jeder chirurg der an seinem operationstisch gestanden hat war eine st tze des systems dann ist das objektiv vielleicht richtig ignoriert aber die lebensleistung dieser menschen
631189 in dieser situation in der sie leben mussten in der ganz berwiegenden zahl ihre w rde behalten in dem ma e wie das system es ihnen erlaubte
631190 es war einsatzkommunikation die nicht f r die ffentlichkeit bestimmt war

631199 things are getting better and stronger but then of course they would through the passage of time
631200 the challenge shes taken on is a considerable one and its important for us to make sure that challenge is progressing not at the expense of her long term health and also to see how that challenge is progressing in terms of her getting towards good shape to be able to perform
631201 dont judge another person when you may be judged the same way as him her
631202 you are doing wrong because you dont read your bible like you should be doing
631203 for with what judgment you judge you will be judged and with the measure you use it will be measured back to you
631204 who do you think he is referring to now its obvious that jesus is referring to a hypocrite and not all christians its pretty self explanatory here you could just read the same example i used before

631353 oakland killers share many characteristics they are young most killed before their 25 th birthday a majority grew up without a father he was either murdered incarcerated or he abandoned his children mom is typically absent too either because she is working several jobs for minimum wage or because shes also lost to the streets through drugs prostitution or prison
631354 these kids have one thing in this world and when you have nothing else no money no access no privileges no resources no means the only thing you have from a little boy on is your respect
631355 none of the convicted killers told the chronicle that they were worried about their futures or consequences of their criminal lifestyle before going to prison to go to school to work for minimum wage to shun the game takes an enormous amount of patience for someone who lives in a war zone the payoff is too far off for someone who doesnt plan for middle age or a career
631356 witnesses are cowed into silence because snitches have been known to disappear nearly half of all murders in oakland go uncharged for lack of a willing witness so a shooter knows he has about a 50 50 chance of getting away with it
631357 some children are born into families that claim the streets children are expected to put the familys gang wars ahead of anything else they skip school when the turf wars heat up and the gang members are expected to stand out on the streets in a show of force
631358 in a dysfunctional environment its prestigious to be a gangster and it inspires you to act the same says a convicted killer it fulfills that ego gives you a sense of identity its like being a star athlete kids in constructive environments their peers give them accolades and support to continue their good behavior by bolstering their ego its identical in the streets only the behavior rewarded is different
631359 it was the drug dealers who gave them their first sense of belonging the gang on the block is the first group that wants them that pays attention to their whereabouts that asks what they are doing and what they think about things
631360 how can people not be resourceful enough to figure things out
631361 many developed their own chemical habits and a little more than half dropped out of school
631362 in this world challenges cannot be left unanswered a boy who is jumped robbed or insulted and doesnt respond is labeled soft or a punk or a bitch he becomes prey
631363 all it takes is a look a put down or a lost fight and bullets fly disrespect is the no 1 reason to kill killings have been concentrated in these neighborhoods for so long that revenge killings continue for decades
631364 gun laws cant reach places like east or west oakland guns are as common as cell phones
631365 boys dont think theyll live past 25 so they dont live their lives as if they will
631366 the body count is woven into the civic consciousness here every mayor leaves city hall on broken promises to quell the violence and the killings continue
631367 the experts and the killers say a mentor might have saved them anyone from the outside who could have shown them another way to be a man
631368 being with joe makes me realize the world is bigger than oakland theres way more places that are cleaner and dont have a bunch of dudes on the corners
631369 children will look for guidance wherever they can and guess who theyre going to look up to in neighborhoods saturated with gangbangers and drug dealers an outsider who shows an interest can give a child that one sliver of hope that they can make it without having to hustle
631370 you work with active change agents and with the vast middle ground of people who are open minded
631371 before it destroys itself may oakland find both that vast middle ground and the brave change agents bearing hope

631404 the indian statement is not only surprising but shocking too

631499 the fact remains there are too many people becoming infected with hiv every year
631500 many of us felt for some time that the methodology originally used was flawed
631501 from our perspective this is certainly indicative of poor planning and poor administration of things going on at cdc
631502 this means that cdcs ability to measure the true scope of the epidemic has improved
631503 there have never been more people living with hiv in the united states or in massachusetts and there will be more tomorrow because of our success in keeping people alive and well
631504 its only going to get worse if we dont match what were seeing with funding and evidence based prevention programs
631505 in the past couple hundred years china has felt they were looked down upon by world powers
631506 the people see the performances of the athletes in these games as a direct reflection of the strength of the country to be honest theres probably too much emphasis on performance
631507 when liu xiang can win a gold medal in one of the pure athletic events like track and field it really symbolizes to the chinese that they are not inferior
631508 a lot of what underlies chinas relationship with the outside world is a deep seated sense of inferiority thats the flip side of the ultranationalism you sometimes see
631509 they didnt know how to play hard just how to pace themselves
631510 theres no doubt about it when they start something they go at it that was one of the great pleasures of working with the team they would do anything asked of them and do it gladly they were so respectful of everything
631511 in the old days they would probably have given her shots and made sure she runs and fights to the last step
631512 now they say were not going to force her to run shes going to have a long career and a future were not going to ruin her right now they really are a lot more open
631513 i feel a little sorry for them because theyve been playing by outdated rules in some ways when it comes to national image and sports
631514 they never quite got it that winning gold medals alone doesnt mean that you have become a strong nation that can compete with other nations
631515 whether china is first place in the medal count or second place or third it probably wont make too much difference in the eyes of the rest of the world
631516 if liu xiang wins the gold medal maybe hell encourage tens of millions of kids to start hurdling in china and theyll have another guy in five years
631517 the impact coming out of the olympics might be greater than the olympics on the horizon
631518 we have a very big population in china so there must be quite some talented athletes
631519 the thing we need to do well now is find a more efficient way to find those talented athletes

631689 i guess the rest of this year we have an opportunity to blood a few kids see how they handle first grade
631690 but thats also difficult because you dont want to throw them into a side thats playing poorly its sort of a catch 22 with how many guys you look to bring in
631691 unfortunately thats the way it is at the moment theres not a lot we can do about it
631692 we need to move on as a club and i dont think the players today were thinking oh i wish sonny bill was here
631693 we prepared as well as we could and i thought the atmosphere was okay pregame in the dressing room but we just fell into the same traps weve done the last couple of weeks and conceded near on 30 points in the first half
631694 im not sure what emotion im feeling at present i guess disappointment is one of them
631695 its difficult its a difficult time for the club its a difficult time for me personally and for all the players and fans its difficult
631696 i wouldnt say were concerned about qantas safety at all in fact weve found no evidence of safety slipping within the airline or safety standards being allowed to drop at all
631697 but weve got to be cognisant if things happen we need to be flexible and proactive and respond to those concerns and thats what were doing
631698 we have no evidence to suggest there are problems within qantas but we think its prudent and wise to go in with a new special team and take an additional look at a range of operational issues within qantas
631699 the civil aviation safety authority has been in there looking at their handling of recent incidents weve been looking at their performance in general we completed an audit in june and weve found no evidence of any problems or shortcomings within the airline
631700 cleary theres been a number of incidents recently and its important that we go in and double check and make sure that all the standards are being maintained
631701 because office buildings have air conditioners and in the wintertime it would be safer because maybe employees wouldnt have to travel in bad weather on certain days
631702 im not certain at this moment whether this would be our biggest reduction i would be pretty surprised if thats where we would get our energy efficiency savings
631703 i wish i could work ten hours a day for four days instead of ten hours a day every day
631704 youd go on the bus with the window open and youd be dirty after the ride
631705 at the sport centre here in calgary thats their concern too
631706 so theyve actually tested athletes to see if they had that a minor case of asthma that would become inflamed if they ever go there

631708 you go outside all day you come back to blow your nose and its covered in soot a lot of people liken it to the industrial revolution that london underwent when there was lots of coal use
631709 i was telling ctv cameraman tom michalak when we were in kandahar how ironic it is were in a war zone but in a lot of ways its healthier to be there

631716 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
631717 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
631718 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
631719 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
631720 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
631721 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
631722 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
631723 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
631724 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
631725 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
631726 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
631727 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
631728 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
631729 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
631730 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
631731 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
631732 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
631733 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
631734 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
631735 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
631736 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
631737 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
631738 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
631739 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
631740 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
631741 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
631742 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
631743 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
631744 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
631745 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
631746 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
631747 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country

631893 we have to decide on one central and basic position and that is that we cooperate and want to help the pragmatic forces among the palestinians those who want to negotiate with us and who are fighting the radical islam of hamas those who oppose terrorism
631894 we are sending a message that no one is above the law and that no family is above the law gaza will enjoy peace and security
631895 i was very afraid to leave their family because i was happy i had a family and i kept holding on to them all the time trying not to lose them
631896 it was the family that raised me that rescued me i also didnt want to leave poland i thought it was the country that let me live
631897 but i was 15 years old i was incredibly scared of the bombs i was no hero
631898 i think of my mother often because she was the dearest person in my life it stays with you all the time what you go through you cant throw it out of your memory
631899 my husband is very religious and doesnt especially care for the jews
631900 anytime he tried to say something against the jews i would tell him you forget who i am
631901 assembling to march and protest is a citizens right but it must be stressed that when exercising this right citizens must respect and not harm others freedoms and rights and must not harm national social and collective interests
631902 given that they have announced these parks i think the government will want to show that citizens have scope to use them
631903 china wants to show it is progressing in human rights
631904 i hope they can reach a solution that fits all parties and prevents the situation from deteriorating further
631905 the mistakes of politicians brought us to this stage our social fabric was torn up in kirkuk and this is very dangerous for all of iraq
631906 they have to settle all their differences otherwise it will lead to a crisis in all iraqi cities
631907 it was a democratic process why did they reject it
631908 we arabs are against any new resolution that could affect our presence in this city
631909 there is no way except talks and obedience to the law
631910 zimbabweans must realise that the country is in a practically binding state of socio economic emergency
631911 as such there is need for a universal moratorium on all incomes and prices for a minimum period of six months
631912 the mdc believes that no amount of tinkering with currency denominations will address the zimbabwean crisis
631913 as long as there is no production we will continue to move in circles as a country

631916 conditions will take away with one hand what has been given with the other
631917 would literally take away with one hand what has been given with the other
631918 the nsg guidelines apply to non nuclear weapons states nnws so our preference is for the nsg to simply say that these guidelines do not apply to india if they are unwilling to say that at a minimum the requirement of full scope safeguards and other prescriptive elements in the guidelines that are intended for nnws must be waived for india
631919 if you read the nsg guidelines as a whole right at the top it says these prescriptions are for non nuclear weapon states there is an enunciation of the requirement that countries must accept full scope safeguards there is language about what happens if one of these states tests there is restrictive language on enrichment and reprocessing enr equipment and so on
631920 of course we are very clear that there cannot be any linkage with nuclear tests
631921 but just as in the 123 agreement with the u s there cannot be any explicit linkage to nuclear testing as a condition in the nsg
631922 i am not interested in labels like the npt definition of a nuclear weapon state because we are what we are
631923 but certainly we dont want the other label to be attached to us either
631924 are any of these elements present in those agreements so our view is that all these things in the nsg are extraneous tomorrow if the political situation changes all these things can create difficulties

631944 im confident that by showing respect to the people to the olympics it will put me in a position to continue to have frank and candid discussions
631945 this is an enormous show of face gesture of face from the president to actually go to the olympics
631946 this is chinas international coming out party in many respects the olympics so its an enormous thing
631947 if this man is going as the leader of the free world to one of the most notorious rights abusing regimes in the world and he spends the whole afternoon watching water polo what does that say about where the united states priorities lie
631948 not every single minute of every day has to be totally organized and so ill be with a lot of my family and theyre fun to hang around with im sure well walk around the different venue sites and just get a sense for the while atmosphere of people from all around the world

631950 but in a nation in which 66 according to a survey commissioned by cars com during july about 50 of us consumers dont believe that obama or mccain has a magic rabbit up their the one
631951 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist
631952 and i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
631953 what im interested in ultimately is going to be governing
631954 what that means is were going to have to try to get things done
631955 theyre very good at negative campaigning theyre not so good at governing
631956 were glad the obama campaign retracted barack obamas accusation because it was absolutely false and were moving on
631957 the only cynical candidate in this election is barack obama for his continued opposition to john mccains comprehensive energy plan that includes additional oil drilling gas tax relief and affordable nuclear energy
631958 none of you thought i was making a racially incendiary remark or playing the race card
631959 it wasnt until john mccains team started pushing it that it ended up being on the front page of the new york times two days in a row
631960 youve got statistics that say weve lost another 50 000 jobs that florida is in a recession for the first time in a decade and a half and what was being talked about was paris and britney
631961 theyre clever on creating distractions from the issues that really matter in peoples lives
631962 we face serious issues in this election and have real differences
631963 im not going to assault sen mccains character im not going to compare him to pop stars i will however compare our two visions for our economic future
631964 this is someone who has been in washington nearly 30 years has a pretty slim record on education and when he has taken a stand its been the wrong one
631965 this is a top forum for hearing important new scientific research and for productive structured dialogue on the major challenges facing the global response to aids
631966 however as is often the case with global conferences like this one the needs of children are too low on the agenda
631967 almost 1 200 children a day under the age of 15 are newly infected with hiv around 90 percent of those from mother to child transmission which is preventable
631968 as a global community we should be ashamed that 9 out of every 10 hiv positive children get the virus from their mothers during pregnancy childbirth or breastfeeding a particular tragedy because mother child transmission can be safely stopped prevention services can reduce transmission risk to less than 2 but only about 1 in 10 hiv positive pregnant women who need arvs get them theres no acceptable reason to not put an end to mother to child transmission
631969 without addressing the needs of children impacted by hiv and aids and of those infected by mother child transmission specifically the iac will sadly prove to be just another expensive talking shop to the millions who need action now
631970 sixty eight people are confirmed dead and 45 others are injured

632001 its a a little after the father again asked his son t he 4th time
632002 today my little son aged three was sitting with me on the sofa when a crow was sitting on the window my son asked me 23 times what it was and i replied to him all 23 times that it was a crow i hugged him lovingly each time h e asked me the same question again and again for 23 times i did not at all feel irritated i rather felt affection for my innocent child
632003 i want to see my parents happy forever they have cared for me ever since i was a little child they have always showered their selfless love on me they crossed all mountains and valleys without seeing the storm and heat to make me a person presentable in the society today
632004 ive kind of gone on record the last couple of times and said thats the best ive been him pitch and i got to pull it back that was extraordinary the guy is throwing 95 miles an hour in the ninth inning he just made it look easy you talk about a guy that was going to win tonight and he wasnt going to let anybody take him out of the game that was tremendous
632005 you take away that first part of the first inning and he was right on top of his game you were looking at a guy that had all of his pitches working that was fun to watch
632006 they swung at a lot of early pitches and i was able to throw strikes with all my pitches
632007 that allowed me to get outs instead of just contact the more guys youve got to face the more pitches youve got to throw i think that was the big key mixing it up
632008 i think the guy had earned every opportunity to win it or lose it himself
632009 for me it was a no brainer it was easy you go to the bullpen there and i think youre telling him hey everything you just did is down the drain i think you dont show him any disrespect by going to the bullpen there you take him out there the boo birds i think would get the noose out
632010 the character prop and line are staples in the competition
632011 we use them for two reasons the first is that it helps ensure teams dont start ahead of time its also interesting to see how people use the same thing in different ways
632012 we dont have a lot of money for big advertising
632013 its a little word of mouth but each year there are more people who discover it
632014 he blames everyone except for himself he doesnt take responsibility thats the whole premise of the movie that he wont man up to anybody
632015 i think the biggest mistake that especially the first timers in the competition make is they try to cram a feature film idea into a four to seven minute window
632016 the most effective films are those that figure out a simple story to tell and dont overshoot the runway
632017 good films are carried by believable performances but the talent pool of actors in louisville is only so deep
632018 they say its not an issue but when we go out and actually start filming it could become a problem
632019 we were kind of limited by the vehicles ideally wed have a pickup truck to mount a tripod in
632020 i hung the camera on a tripod upside down out the back of sharons pt cruiser at one point kyle was holding on to my belt so i didnt fall out
632021 thats the kind of guerrilla filmmaking you have to do when you have no money
632022 always the things i cant control are the most stressful
632023 colby would talk me down from having a panic attack several times
632024 its actually kind of cool like this indie art movie i never expected to make
632025 when people ask me what it means i can say
632026 the plot sort of demands some assembly from the audience for them to know whats going on
632027 a professional filmmaking group approached us they wanted to talk to our writers about doing something for them

632030 its still a mystery why women get autoimmune diseases more than men
632031 it cant be explained entirely by genetics there are a lot of other things happening on the environmental side as well
632032 i am personally pleased that a solution has been found and this can only be to the benefit of all the people of sheffield

632043 the islamic veiling today crystallizes a myriad of new tensions between religion and secularism piety and politics feminism and islamism but foremost it points to the centrality of the questions of womens body and sexuality in organizing public life it is a reminder of a personal embodied practice but is also a symbol communicated to others in public realm the meaning that women subjectively assign to islamic covering and its public perceptions might not be the same and can differ it is these interstices and mis communication between personal and the public calls for social scientific comprehension and visual representation

632061 libraries and bookstores clearly have different missions free provision of information vs profit although we deal with many of the same physical items at this point what tallis envisions as the pervasive library runs contrary to the definitions and missions of the organizations he uses as examples

632071 what shock he the supporter of contraception must undergo when he strikes a match and it lights up
632072 we recognize that virtually all catholics are living in a state of serious sin but there is nothing we can do about it so we wash our hands of responsibility
632073 the practice of contraception is a grave sin those who indulge in the practice are in danger of losing their immortal souls christianity has always held holds now and always will hold that contraception is a serious offense against god unless repented it is punishable by eternal deprivation of the vision of god which we call eternal death
632074 the doctrine is true but the presentation has been fatally flawed

632083 heres the deal i was contacted by one of the biggest musicians in rock and roll bigger that skid row bigger that guns n roses some other mystery guy he was putting together a supergroup with slash on guitar and he wanted me to sing it looked like it was going to happen but it is not happening now it may happen in the future but it is not happening now i want to make that clear
632084 we have a guy who weve been working with whos a really good singer and a great guy i really hope hes the one the question is does he have that extra thing its just really hard to tell until you do a gig theres a lot of expectation in truth he has to be killer to front velvet revolver were writing amazing material and i really think the new record will be the best thing that weve done as a band so do we have the right singer to do that music justice
632085 we got a call from a pretty big guy who wants to be our singer i cant say who that is yet but talks are happening about it and hopefully well see what happens in the next couple of months
632086 no no its a lot cooler than that but i dont know if its going to happen so i cant say its cool that people are calling us and wanting to get in the band so thats exciting

632096 the big idea being bandied around at the moment is the reality tv show it would be based on tv talent show searches like the bbc did to find an actress to play maria in
632097 there are a number of channel 4 executives who are keen on the idea but there is a fear that some stuffy viewers may not like it

632114 ini semua adalah karena saya mentaati pesan ayah karena ayah berpesan supaya saya tidak menagih kepada orang yang berhutang kepada saya maka saya tidak pernah menghutangkan sehingga dengan demikian modal tidak susut
632115 juga ayah berpesan agar supaya jika saya berangkat ke toko atau pulang dari toko tidak boleh terkena sinar matahari maka saya berangkat ke toko sebelum matahari terbit dan pulang sesudah matahari terbenam karenanya toko saya buka sebelum toko lain buka dan tutup jauh sesudah toko yang lain tutup
632116 sehingga karena kebiasaan itu orang menjadi tahu dan tokoku menjadi laris karena mempunyai jam kerja lebih lama
632117 saya tidak mau kuenya uang ini anggap saja sedekah dari saya
632118 hai adik kecil kenapa uangnya kamu berikan kepada orang lain kamu berjualan kan untuk mendapatkan uang kenapa setelah uang ada di tanganmu malah kamu berikan ke orang lain
632119 om jangan marah ya ibu saya mengajarkan kepada saya untuk mendapatkan uang dari usaha berjualan bukan dari mengemis kue kue ini dibuat oleh ibu saya sendiri dan ibu pasti akan sedih dan marah jika saya menerima uang dari om bukan dari hasil menjual kue tadi om bilang uang sedekah maka uangnya saya berikan kepada pengemis itu
632120 baiklah berapa banyak kue yang kamu bawa saya borong semua untuk oleh oleh
632121 terima kasih dik atas pelajaran hari ini sampaikan salam saya kepada ibumu
632122 terima kasih om ibu pasti akan senang sekali hasil kerja kerasnya dihargai dan itu sangat berarti bagi kehidupan kami

632124 go on adam but be quick i have a world to create
632125 when you created eve why did you make her body so curved and tender unlike mine
632126 i did that adam so that you could love her
632127 oh well then why did you give her long shiny beautiful hair and not me
632128 i did that adam so that you could love her
632129 oh well then why did you make her so stupid certainly not so that i could love her
632130 teman apakah engkau terluka jangan takut tunggu sebentar aku akan segera mencari tali untuk menolongmu
632131 teman aku sudah datang talinya akan kuikat ke pohon sisanya akan kulemparkan ke kamu tangkap dan ikatkan dipinggangmu pegang erat erat aku akan menarikmu keluar dari lubang
632132 mengapa setelah aku memukulmu kamu menulis di atas pasir dan setelah aku menyelamatkanmu kamu menulis di atas batu
632133 setelah kamu memukul aku menulis di atas pasir karena kemarahan dan kebencianku terhadap perbuatan buruk yang kamu perbuat ingin segera aku hapus seperti tulisan di atas pasir yang akan segera terhapus bersama tiupan angin dan sapuan ombak
632134 tapi ketika kamu menyelamatkan aku aku menulis di atas batu karena perbuatan baikmu itu pantas dikenang dan akan terpatri selamanya di dalam hatiku sekali lagi terima kasih sobat
632135 hidup dengan memikul beban kebencian kemarahan dan dendam sungguh melelahkan apalagi bila orang yang kita benci itu tidak sengaja melakukan bahkan mungkin tidak pernah tahu bahwa dia telah menyakiti hati kita sungguh ketidakbahagiaan yang sia sia memang benar bila setiap kesalahan orang kepada kita kita tuliskan di atas pasir bahkan di udara segera berlalu bersama tiupan angin sehingga kita tidak perlu kehilangan setiap kesempatan untuk berbahagia sebaliknya tidak melupakan orang yang pernah menolong kita seperti tulisan yang terukir di batu karang yang tidak akan pernah hilang untuk kita kenang selamanya

632176 it is possible that the group which may be responsible for the blasts in ahmedabad and planting of bombs in surat belong to a new generation of terrorist group

632237 every candidate has baggage but if part of the reason to put sebelius on the ticket is to reach out to catholics obama should recall that john kerry who also struggled rhetorically tying his religion to a progressive agenda lost the catholic vote partly as a result of his fight with the conservative hierarchs four years ago

632241 we still have a long way to go however community support is growing and we believe the gold coast is telling us they want this team now we have players who are telling us they want to play for us so we are confident we are on the right track
632242 het vinden van sponsors is een beetje lastig je zou toch zeggen dat iedereen wel wil helpen
632243 zelfs onze kleren laten we achter op het stel na natuurlijk dat we op onze terugreis dragen
632244 dat is een lang verhaal eigenlijk komt het door mijn zwager willy die daar sinds 1962 missionaris is in 1995 ben ik voor het eerst bij hem op bezoek geweest en ik was direct verkocht alles in het land valt tegen er is helemaal niets maar de mensen zijn zo verschrikkelijk aardig ze hebben niets maar overal waar je komt krijg je wat een kip een geit zelfgemaakte kleren na dat eerste bezoek wist ik het zeker hier kom ik nog eens terug en dat heb ik ook diverse keren gedaan
632245 ik ben sinds 1995 diverse keren teruggeweest in burkina faso en heb hier in nederland diverse keren geld ingezameld voor goede doelen daar ik wil nu met een aantal leerlingen van middelbare scholen die mij in het verleden hebben geholpen bij die inzamelingsacties naar burkina om daar weer een nieuw project op te zetten we willen een runderstal gaan bouwen zodat het vee er niet langer los rondloopt en bovendien sneller vet wordt
632246 toen ik op het gertrudis de leerlingen vroeg wie er mee wilde stak bijna iedereen zijn vinger op toen vervolgens duidelijk werd dat dat iedere leerling tweeduizend euro zou gaan kosten was de belangstelling begrijpelijk natuurlijk al wat minder maar uiteindelijk valt het met die kosten allemaal mee dankzij een subsidie hoeven de leerlingen nog maar een kwart van dat bedrag zelf te betalen de rest wordt bijgelegd dus eigenlijk is deze trip nog goedkoper dan een vakantie naar de costas
632247 in de eerste plaats dat de mensen daar geen zielepoten zijn ze hebben weliswaar heel weinig maar ik denk dat wij hier met veel meer problemen zitten dan zij daar daarmee wil ik trouwens niet zeggen dat je dus alles maar zo moet laten in een land als burkina faso waar je wat kunt doen moet je dat zeker niet laten ik ben ook heel benieuwd hoe de leerlingen de meesten zijn trouwens meisjes die meegaan straks terugkijken op hun reis en of de trip hun kijk op afrika veranderd heeft
632248 pfff veel heel veel het leert je bijvoorbeeld beter naar jezelf te kijken om een voorbeeld te geven op een gegeven moment schreef ik een brief naar iemand in een dorp daar maar ik kreeg maar niets terug vond ik raar totdat ik bij een volgend bezoek begreep dat die mensen analfabeet waren daar had ik helemaal niet bij stilgestaan soms duurt het ook gewoon heel lang voordat je een brief terugkrijgt en dat is voor een ongeduldig iemand als ik nou eenmaal ben weleens moeilijk maar als je dan hoort dat de brievenbus voor een dorp in burkina 35 kilometer verderop ligt en er nog niet eens een weg naar toe loopt snap je dat de mensen daar maar eens in de zoveel tijd zon brievenbus legen

632264 il faut relativiser cette victoire je pense que cela va plus contrarier les lyonnais que nous satisfaire on a vu quon avait produit beaucoup de jeu un jeu int ressant en 1re mi temps cest a qui est satisfaisant
632265 on est forc ment d u car on voulait gagner apr s cest la loterie hugo lloris ndlr avait fait ce quil fallait apr s cest nous qui avons rat le coche cest triste car on avait les cartes en mains dans lensemble le match tait assez quilibr ils ont eu la premi re mi temps nous la deuxi me m me si je pense quils ont eu plus doccasions franches que nous on est encore en phase de pr paration il faut trouver certains automatismes
632266 rien nest jamais acquis une s ance de penalties cest un peu le hasard la loterie jai eu la chance d tre en r ussite et den arr ter deux mais on a eu la malchance den mettre deux au dessus cest comme a cest le football il faut oublier et repartir vers lavant c tait un bon match bien engag avec deux belles formations bordeaux a aussi fait un gros match on a r pondu pr sent le score de 0 0 tait logique jai fait en sorte d tre le plus concentr possible d tre vigilant je ne connais pas parfaitement mes d fenseurs mais cest de mieux en mieux cest de bon augure pour la suite
632267 on est tr s satisfaits de cette victoire et quand cest un troph e cest plus plaisant bien s r je suis content de l tat desprit notamment de notre premi re mi temps de grande qualit de tr s bonne facture apr s on a un peu baiss de pied physiquement mais cela a t le cas des deux quipes et l on a pu voir que lyon reste un candidat tr s s rieux car dans la fatigue ils ont eu plus de ma trise technique que nous moins de d chet nos joueurs sont en train de dig rer la lourde pr paration quon a faite m me si ce soir les deux quipes n taient pas encore au top physiquement et tactiquement c tait int ressant de se mesurer une tr s bonne quipe qui domine le foot fran ais depuis un bon moment

632270 islamic institutions which gibran academy is not whether schools or mosques have a pattern of extremism and even violence
632271 learning arabic in and of itself promotes an islamic outlook
632272 arabic language instruction is inevitably laden with pan arabist and islamist baggage
632273 muslims tend to see non muslims learning arabic as a step toward an eventual conversion to islam an expectation i encountered while studying arabic in cairo in the 1970s
632274 this proposal for an arabic language school is utter madness considering that five years after september 11 ground zero is still a hole in the ground and were bending over backwards to appease those sympathetic to individuals who would destroy us again
632275 it basically means shaking off that is the root word if you look it up in arabic i understand it is developing a negative connotation due to the uprising in the palestinian israeli areas i dont believe the intention is to have any of that kind of violence in new york city i think its pretty much an opportunity for girls to express that they are part of new york city society and shaking off oppression
632276 at the core of the debate over the school is a linguistic disconnect

632287 the enthusiasm that obama has generated in other parts of the country is certainly not evident here
632288 that goes a long way to explaining the low turnout in the primary
632289 i would rather have had somebody different than john mccain on the republican side but i cant even believe who the democrats picked
632290 i know our country will be in bad shape if barack obama is elected president
632291 i know the news media give john mccain fits and are for barack obama but tell me what has barack obama done
632292 honestly it amazed me when the republicans began talking about putting george bush on the ticket back in 1999
632293 most likely hes done more damage to the republican party than anybody ever hes probably going to be the one who elects barack obama
632294 i think we need a younger man with some ideas to change things up a little

632532 ambas candidaturas se han formalizado bajo la modalidad de independientes y eso nos exige trabajar el doble

632544 fiction is really about how to get around in the social world which is not as easy as one might think
632545 people who read fiction give themselves quite a bit of practice in understanding that and also i think reading fiction sort of prompts one to think about these questions you know what are these people up to
632546 because you absorb the craftsmanship of the writer and because the story itself helps you understand the behaviour of other human beings

632583 no ano passado no mundial terminamos em quarto lugar mas com um tempo que nos daria a medalha de prata ou de ouro em todos os mundiais anteriores isso mostra que podemos chegar longe s precisamos estar focados e acreditar
632584 esse time sempre foi muito centrado movido pela determina o e treino forte e claro temos uma passagem de bast o que hoje copiada no mundo inteiro mas sempre tivemos atletas de muita garra muita for a de vontade que nunca se intimidou com atleta nenhum

632624 drug disasters are literally built into the current system of drug testing and approvals in the united states
632625 recent changes in the system have only increased the proportion of new drugs with serious risks
632626 based on our current system the designation of safe and effective on todays new drugs could be replaced with apparently safe based on incomplete information and more effective than a placebo
632627 speed up reviews for safety have more than tripled the number of black box warnings of side effects or withdrawals after drugs are on the market
632628 despite recent reforms to strengthen the fdas role in protecting the public from harmful drugs the harm benefit ratio is worsening due to these reviews and relaxed rules that allow companies to promote drugs for unapproved uses

632640 a couple of our players they made the comment that there was only talk about him and not about the current team and stars and everybodys waiting for the next rumour without anything concrete
632641 it is an interesting challenge for alparslan erdem because galatasaray have in mind a good role for him in their team
632642 nevertheless it is a real shame because he was on the fringes of our team and would have had chances
632643 the fact is we have a strong competition for places at left full back and there are lots of young players coming through
632644 galatasarays offer was attractive for everybody and was lucrative for us
632645 i have had a good time here and felt very happy but i think i have better prospects at galatasaray
632646 a large part of my family lives in turkey so i will feel at home very quickly

632665 if a sovereign wealth fund came along with a huge amount of money then theyd be tempted but i suspect it would be getting to the stage where bernie is replaced if someone wanted to buy it the whole business depends on a man who is 78 years old
632666 after a good lap on the final run in q2 pushed me a few places up the grid weve definitely made some progress with the new developments to the car in particular the new rear suspension is working well and this has enabled us to improve the car step by step over the weekend
632667 i got the most out of the car and its encouraging to see we were only three tenths away from the top ten as it has been a while since we were that close im on the dirty side of the grid which is a disadvantage but i am sure we can have a good race from here nonetheless
632668 it got a bit too far maybe it is such an issue at the moment in spain it gets a bit over the top
632669 a couple of our players they made the comment that there was only talk about him and not about the current team and stars and everybodys waiting for the next rumour without anything concrete
632670 weve got to wait to see what will happen in the transfer market with regard to signing a new striker but what wayne did last season was staggering
632671 he had to take the responsibility of leading the line on his shoulders and he was awesome
632672 he played out of position a lot he played on the left and sacrificed himself so many times for the team
632673 i know the manager wants to see wayne playing in his more accustomed position just off the front
632674 were very concerned they could go into a nose dive that they wouldnt recover from
632675 they cant really strut their stuff anywhere where theres something tall nearby
632676 without those leks theres not going to be baby prairie chickens in the next generation
632677 as you see isolation happening you can pretty much count on overall population rates going downhill
632678 it basically means that we dont have the time and financial resources to work on that one yet
632679 there is a lot of really good opportunity in virginia
632680 we are strong advocates for renewable energy and wind energy

632683 fasting in shab n is better than fasting in the sacred months and the best of voluntary fasts are those that are observed in the months closest to ramad n before or after the status of these fasts is like that of as sunan al raw tib which are done before and after fard prayers and which make up for any shortfall in the number of obligatory prayers the same applies to fasts observed before and after ramad n just as al sunan al raw tib are better than other kinds of voluntary prayers so fasts observed in the months before and after ramad n are better than fasts at other times

632691 perbuatan mana mana individu muslim sama ada pemimpin atau rakyat yang meletakkan kalungan bunga tabik hormat dan bertafakur yang dilakukan untuk tugu negara adalah bercanggah dengan prinsip prinsip akidah islam yang anti kepada sebarang unsur keberhalaan
632692 ia tetap haram kerana meniru perbuatan musyrikin dan jika pelaku beriktikad itu memberikan kemanfaatan kepada keamanan kedamaian ruh mereka yang telah meninggal dunia maka itu adalah perbuatan syirik yang jelas
632693 akidah islam menentang sebarang unsur keberhalaan pemimpin atau sesiapa sahaja yang terlibat dalam perbuatan ini hendaklah bertaubat kepada allah dan kembali kepada akidah islam yang sebenar
632694 meletakkan kalungan bunga di tugu peringatan sempena upacara sambutan hari pahlawan dan upacara upacara lain adalah haram dan hendaklah ditinggalkan
632695 sebenarnya persaingan politik malaysia pada hari ini adalah antara dato seri anwar ibrahim dan dato seri najib tun razak
632696 pada 1998 anwar difitnah dengan tuduhan liwat kerana beliau pada waktu itu sudah sedikit sahaja lagi akan menjadi perdana menteri malaysia kini 2008 situasinya sama di mana anwar hari ini juga sedikit sahaja lagi akan menjadi perdana menteri maka skrip lama berkenaan isu liwat itu diulang
632697 semua taktik jahat ini dilakukan bagi memastikan kelangsungan politik najib dan bn terus kekal dan selamat
632698 saya mengambil sikap hanya akan melayan kenyataan dari anwar dan wan azizah sahaja sehingga hari ini saya masih menunggu reaksi mereka
632699 saya tetap akan pertahankan maruah saya dan akan bersumpah secara islam untuk menunjukkan kebenaran
632700 tercalon atau tidak saya tetap berada di barisan hadapan dan bersamasama berjuang
632701 saya hanya menyatakan kesediaan sahaja dan akhirnya keputusan tetap dibuat oleh pucuk pimpinan parti
632702 hanya saya tahu apa yang anwar tahu dan anwar tahu apa yang saya tahu saya masih lagi berpegang kepada prinsip untuk tidak mengaibkan orang
632703 tindakan itu juga semata mata untuk pertahankan parti yang jelas mengidolakan pemimpin mereka lebih daripada perjuangan terhadap bangsa dan negara
632704 malangnya dasar itu hanya untuk yang berkroni kepadanya setiap syarikat akan menerima kontrak tanpa rundingan yang jauh berbeza seperti yang diperjuangkannya kini iaitu open tender tender terbuka
632705 dengan ini saya berpendapat adalah amat wajar bagi saya mempertahankan jawatan naib presiden supaya dapat terus berperanan dalam membantu peralihan kepimpinan ini
632706 keputusan ini saya buat atas kesedaran dan prinsip yang saya dokong dari dulu hingga sekarang iaitu sentiasa bersedia dan bersama menjamin keutuhan parti dan menampilkan barisan kepimpinan tertinggi yang berwibawa dan kuat agar mampu berusaha memperjuangkan teras perpaduan dan nasib kaum melayu demi kepentingan bangsa agama dan negara

632724 daca petrolul nu ne mai face surprize si daca nu vor mai fi variabile cu impact negativ credem ca vom avea o crestere foarte redusa aproape de zero in urmatoarele luni insa nu va fi vorba de o recesiune

632766 tiada sesuatu yang paling mulia dalam pandangan allah selain dari berdoa kepada nya sedang kita dalam keadaan lapang
632767 rasulullah datang ketempat wuquf di arafah dan ia menghadap kiblat lalu terus menerus berdoa sehingga tenggelam matahari
632768 ketika nabi muhammad saw duduk dimesjid tiba tiba datang seorang laki laki masuk lalu ia shalat setelah selesai ia membaca doa allahummaghfirlii warhamnii maka waktu itu rasulullah pun berkata wahai kawan engkau terburu buru jika kau shalat duduklah dahulu kemudian bacalah puji pujian kepada allah karena dia yang memiliki pujian itu lalu kau baca shalawat kepadaku kemudian baru berdoa kemudian datang seorang yang lain setelah shalat ia memuji allah dan membaca shalawat untuk nabi muhammad saw dan setelah itu nabi bersabda berdoalah akan dipenuhi
632769 berserulah berdoa kepada tuhanmu dengan merendahkan diri dan suara yang lembut sesungguhnya allah tidak menyukai orang orang yang melampaui batas dan janganlah engkau berbuat kerusakan dibumi sesudah allah swt memperbaikinya dan berdoalah kepada nya dengan rasa takut tidak diterima dan harap akan dikabulkan sesungguhnya rahmat allah amat dekat kepada orang orang yang berbuat baik

632845 drug disasters are literally built into the current system of drug testing and approvals in the united states
632846 recent changes in the system have only increased the proportion of new drugs with serious risks
632847 based on our current system the designation of safe and effective on todays new drugs could be replaced with apparently safe based on incomplete information and more effective than a placebo
632848 speed up reviews for safety have more than tripled the number of black box warnings of side effects or withdrawals after drugs are on the market
632849 despite recent reforms to strengthen the fdas role in protecting the public from harmful drugs the harm benefit ratio is worsening due to these reviews and relaxed rules that allow companies to promote drugs for unapproved uses

632853 workers were being asked to carry the entire economy on their backs
632854 there was no willingness on the part of employers to make any offer that would relieve the pressure of inflation rising energy and food costs on the working people who are increasingly finding it hard to cover the basics of life in ireland in 2008
632855 the talks have failed because the employers bodies fail to recognise that irish workers are suffering from huge inflationary pressures and are really struggling at the moment ictu and government were committed to a flat rate increase for all employees which would protect low paid workers from dropping below the poverty line
632856 ibec put forward a proposal seeking an initial pay freeze for six months which from our point of view is unrealistic workers have already had what is essentially a pay freeze for the last year due to cost of living increases and now the employers bodies want workers to take what is really a pay cut for the next six months
632857 ireland is facing the most challenging economic conditions since the late 80s and it requires leadership by government trade unions and business to put in place arrangements that will help us to regain competitiveness and protect the maximum number of jobs
632858 ich w rde sagen das unterscheidet die formel 1 von jeder anderen sportart denn du hast eineinhalb stunden lang eine herzfrequenz von 170 schl gen pro minute und das siehst du bei keinem anderen sport
632859 das macht den gro en unterschied aus und deswegen musst du als formel 1 pilot richtig fit sein
632860 die herzfrequenz ist erstaunlich weshalb die piloten eine aerobe fitness auf besonders hohem niveau ben tigen sie joggen fahren fahrrad und machen alle sportarten die den aeroben bereich ansprechen der zweite teil des trainings ist speziell auf den nacken zugeschnitten
632861 sie brauchen eine sehr starke halsmuskulatur denn in jeder kurve wirken in etwa 20 bis 25 kilogramm gewicht auf den nacken au erdem brauchen formel 1 piloten nat rlich noch einen durchtrainierten oberk rper sowie starke unterarme
632862 das gehirn verh lt sich eigentlich wie ein muskel denn du kannst es trainieren
632863 wir bereiten uns mit diesen simulationen welche ber jahre hinweg entwickelt wurden mental vor
632864 ich kann das leicht daheim machen oder sie auch w hrend des grand prix wochenendes an meinem laptop abspielen es geht darum konzentriert zu bleiben und das ber eine renndistanz auch aufrecht zu erhalten das ist nat rlich nicht ganz so einfach wenn man in einem blitzschnellen formel 1 auto sitzt
632865 der unterschied zu einer normalen person ist dass der fahrer im vergleich mit seinen leistungen konomischer haushalten kann das bedeutet schlicht und ergreifend dass er in der lage ist seine performance ber einen l ngeren zeitraum abzurufen das ist der wichtige punkt auf den wir im training besonders acht geben m ssen
632866 seit beginn dieser saison haben wir im vergleich zum vorjahr festgestellt dass die herzfrequenz um etwa f nf bis zehn schl ge erh ht ist und die fahrer schwitzen auch mehr
632867 als es wieder stark zu regnen begann hatte ich l auf der windschutzscheibe und konnte das einfach nicht mehr loswerden
632868 am ende musste ich ganz am streckenrand fahren und mit ein wenig speed hat sich das wasser auf der scheibe auch verfl chtigt aber hinter dem pacecar haben sich wasser und l vermischt und meine sicht war schlicht und ergreifend gleich null
632869 ich bin mir sicher dass die ganze unternehmung 1998 nach meinem formel 1 titel wesentlich leichter gewesen w re
632870 im prinzip haben alle gro en respekt davor was ich erreicht habe aber man will wissen wie es mir in einer saison mit 36 ovalrennen ergehen w rde bist du noch hungrig um das alles zu tun das ist vermutlich das gr te fragezeichen
632871 ich war wahrscheinlich ein bisschen bermotiviert und habe beim start zu viel riskiert
632872 ich lie die kupplung zu fr h los das lag daran dass meine hinterachse stark bersteuerte damit hatte ich das ganze rennen ber zu k mpfen warum das so war kann ich jetzt noch nicht sagen wir m ssen das erst genau analysieren
632873 au erdem war mein speed heute einfach nicht gut genug und so konnte ich villa javier villa anm d red nie wirklich unter druck setzen
632874 das ist der wahnsinn ich bin mir nicht sicher ob ich das ganze schon glauben kann
632875 war eines meiner ganz gro en idole und ich habe heute nur aus respekt vor jacques mein t shirt nicht getragen
632876 wir hatten noch viel l nger drau en bleiben k nnen aber nascar hat das richtige gemacht die strecke stand komplett unter wasser die bedingungen wurden so schlecht dass man nicht mehr viel sprit verbraucht hat denn man konnte selbst auf der geraden das gaspedal kaum mehr voll durchdr cken
632877 die gischt war bei 110 stundenkilometern schon so gro man hat nur noch spray gesehen so etwas hnliches hatten wir in le mans mit der corvette
632878 ganz bitter entt uscht wir haben dieses rennen dominiert und ich habe in der boxengasse einen fehler gemacht ich konnte die boxenausfahrt nicht einsehen und bin zu fr h aufs gaspedal gestiegen
632879 wir hatten einen tollen tag ich bin nur sehr entt uscht dar ber dass ich meine jungs im stich gelassen habe wir haben das rennen kontrolliert und das ist schon eine schande f r das gesamte team
632880 ich w nschte nur es h tte ein wenig l nger gedauert denn ich denke schon dass wie eine siegchance gehabt h tten
632881 jeder hat sich gefragt ob die funktionieren w rden und das haben sie
632882 ich wei nicht ob ich da drau en auf sieben jahre alten slicks fahren h tte wollen aber die regenreifen waren gut
632883 ich bin schon berrascht wie gut sich alle verkauft haben
632884 am ende gab es nur unf lle unter gelb weil man absolut nichts mehr gesehen hat
632885 as far back as the year 2000 the respondent has actually attempted to murder several other people either through poisoning he is a revenge killer when he feels that hes been slighted or has had especially toward women he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings
632886 has been forensically diagnosed by several top psychiatrists as a sociopathic homicidal killer i have that in evidence and through my working with him i also believe that to be very true
632887 very important that the fbi present their case against bruce and not just state that the investigation was over because it was him and hes gone
632888 im concerned about what closing this case without conclusive evidence might do to harm our life sciences enterprise i think we as americans need to see the proof
632889 its a shame the man is not here with us we might have known more
632890 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure

632897 in fact everythings on the house ive bought the place
632898 what brought you back to keighworth what made you buy this place
632899 its the only place where i ever felt i had roots the place i used to come back to during the holidays at school or on leave from the army the place where ma and pa and you two and your family were the place where i could always pick up a few quid when i needed them
632900 after all dear tom blood is thicker than water as youve so kindly demonstrated all these years all ive done is repay you and as for this place i bought it to stay here whenever i come home i cant go on sponging on you good people can i
632901 you know therell come a time when ill be too old to go gadding off and id rather end my days here than anywhere else
632902 i warn malacanang not to sign the grp milf memorandum of agreement on ancestral domain president arroyo will be committing an impeachable offense since the agreement constitutes a gross violation of the 1987 constitution
632903 to say that we need to amend the constitution for this moa only lends credence to allegations that the arroyo administration intends to unscrupulously exploit the mindanao peace process in its relentless bid to amend the 1987 constitution and pave the way to extend president arroyos stay in power beyond 2010
632904 it will reportedly authorize the bje to sign trade pacts friendship treaties and other international agreements with foreign countries and send representatives to asean and the united nations
632905 you cannot divide sovereignty which the moa provides for when it allows bje to exercise shared authority and responsibility with the philippine government over the bangsamoro homeland
632906 this moa goes beyond the constitutional parameters and boundaries which provides only for autonomous regions i am for the granting of full and genuine authority to the autonomous region for muslim mindanao armm but the process should not violate the constitution
632907 a system of governance suitable and acceptable to the bangsamoro as a distinct dominant people
632908 it is essential to lay the foundation of the bangsamoro homeland in order to address the bangsamoro peoples humanitarian and economic needs as well as their political aspirations
632909 lopez family is not in the business of bribing people in the pursuit of its businesses or to win cases in court
632910 if we could do that nsg process expeditiously we can deliver the package to the us congress in september we have a lot to to in short term we hope we can bring it to fruition
632911 well by the time we get to the nuclear suppliers group we hope no country will object it is simply a process we have been working on with countries who had questions and are getting those questions answered
632912 we have been working with the nsg we have that line going
632913 now that the indian government has worked its way through its political issues we are going to go forward full steam with that
632914 this is work leave the other parts of life at the door

632949 the indian statement is not only surprising but shocking too
632950 there were also bombing incidents in pakistan subsequently but we have not pointed fingers at anyone as we believe in carrying out investigations before laying responsibility
632951 such baseless accusations serve no purpose other than vitiating bilateral atmosphere

633069 sin embargo cuando est s en un equipo y sabes que tu compa ero tiene la oportunidad de ganar y t no y tienes los valores correctos no s lo tus propios motivos y tus propios objetivos y tu propio ego smo entonces tomas una decisi n de dejar pasar a ese piloto

633096 in plaats daarvan is het bijna een sociale norm geworden dat kinderen uitsluitend onder begeleiding van een volwassene de straat op mogen en aangezien het gezien de tijdsdruk voor veel ouders niet altijd mogelijk is om als chaperon op te treden zullen de kinderen thuis nog meer tijd voor hun computerscherm doorbrengen

633100 het kopen van cadeaus om een goede beurt te maken bij een vrouw is al sinds mensenheugenis een vast onderdeel van de relatie tussen de geslachten nu blijkt dat het niet zozeer de eigenlijke gift is dan wel de indruk van gulheid die door mannen wordt gebruikt als een signaal eerder onderzoek heeft al uitgewezen dat vrouwen inderdaad worden aangesproken door gulle mannen je zou generositeit kunnen zien als een middel waarmee mannen kunnen tonen dat ze geschikt zijn om te investeren in een relatie en om te helpen bij het grootbrengen van kinderen

633103 any actor in his right mind would want to do this film would die to do it
633104 it took me six minutes to walk here the bag was on the belt most of the time its a 15 to 20 minute delay from when the plane lands
633105 in the past ive waited two hours or they lost my luggage coming back just from a simple flight from boston this is a very favorable experience ive seen improvement
633106 that used to be a pretty regular part of my life
633107 i dont profess to be a miracle worker but i hold people accountable
633108 what was lacking here was accountability direction people needed to know where do you want us to go they needed someone to lead the way
633109 because thats when we have had service problems in the past
633110 weve been able to work through a lot of issues
633111 we review any delay we tear it apart what happened
633112 im not there to beat anybody up the intent is to understand what happened and what we could have done to avoid or minimize it
633113 if the managers flight incurs a delay he or she is asked to come to the noon meeting to share what happened
633114 a little accountability and direction you put all that into the formula its working
633115 we have come a long way but we still have a long way to go
633116 we fear that change will be much harder and longer than many might believe
633117 the dysfunction at dhs goes deep down to the bone
633118 this failure is appalling on many levels not least because ms walkers job was to supervise five employees to make sure that they completed their investigations
633119 if she did not do this what on earth was she being paid for
633120 workers like poindexter to continuously ignore reports of children being abused and neglected
633121 instead of supporting supervisors who tried to hold poindexter accountable ms poller covered up for him for his lax supervisor janice walker and for herself
633122 we heard from the dhs workforce find ways to get rid of the bad workers because it brings us all down
633123 and wed wait until the grand jury finished its work
633124 expectations need to be made clear to the workers and im very very focused on accountability
633125 some people are going to have to go as we move forward
633126 im prepared to make those decisions and its clear from the report that other people who sat in my seat were not
633127 oh egipto tiempo vendra en que no quedara nada de tus religiones sino vagos relatos en los que la posteridad ya no creera en la tierra y el mar reina zeus subterraneo los tiempos ser n mejores bajo la dominacion de aquellos que ahora estan establecidos en un gran ciudad bajo la monta a de libia
633128 todos se han marchado han encontrado sitios mas apropiados para sus viviendas eran fuertes y emprendedores algo nuevo los atrajo pero yo sabia que no existe nada nuevo en la tierra y no quise cambiar el sitio de mi muerte asi se marchan los mas fuertes los que ya estan declinando esperan la muerte con paciencia acaso no es esta la historia de todas las migraciones de todas las empresas
633129 te demostrare que el relato sobre los chud lo habitantes subterraneos no es una fantasia te conducire hasta la entrada del reino subterraneo
633130 una vez en este fertil valle vivio y florecio la poderosa tribu chud sabian como explorar el terreno en busca de minerales y como segar la mejor cosecha esta tribu era muy pacifica e industriosa pero entonces vino un zar blanco con hordas innumerables de guerreros crueles los pacificos e industriosos chud no pudieron resistir los ataques de los conquistadores y no queriendo perder su libertad permanecieron como siervos del zar blanco entonces por primera vez comenzo a crecer un abedul blanco en esta region de acuerdo con las profec as los chud supieron que era el momento de su partida y los chud no queriendo permanecer sometidos al zar blanco se marcharon bajo la tierra solo a veces se puede oir cantar al pueblo sagrado ahora sus campanas resuenan en los templos subterraneos pero llegara el glorioso momento de la purificacion humana y en esos dias los grandes chud volveran a aparecer en toda su gloria
633131 aqui estamos he aqui la entrada del gran reino subterraneo cuando los chud entraron en el pasaje subterraneo cerraron la entrada con piedras ahora nos encontramos junto a esta sagrada entrada
633132 ah contest son doring piedras alargadas este es un antiguo lugar sagrado es muy util poner grasa en las cabezas de las piedras entonces las deidades de este sitio ayudan a los viajeros
633133 nadie lo sabe pero desde epocas antiguas esta zona ha sido llamada doring piedras largas las personas dicen que gentes desconocidas pasaron por aqui hace mucho
633134 los mas fuertes han pasado por aqui y han encontrado los sitios mas apropiados
633135 porque mi mapa de cuentos fantasticos se vio comprobado cuando en carnac sostienes en una mano el extremo de una cuerda encantada no es una alegria encontrar el otro extremo en los transhimalayas
633136 pero estas seguro de que las personas de quienes hablas son los llamados godos
633137 para mi no tiene importancia como se llamen si fueron los antepasados de los godos o sus descendientes acaso estos fueron vinculos profundos con las tribus celtas o alanas o escitas alguna otra persona debera hacer estos escrupulosos calculos pero me regocijo ante el hecho de que en las cimas de los transhimalayas he visto la personificacion de carnac no insisto en las nomenclaturas pues las nomenclaturas superficiales han cambiado con mucha frecuencia ante mis propios ojos y muchas veces un asi llamado hecho ha sido falsificado con toda facilidad por periodos de aproximadamente mil a os nunca olvidare mi sorpresa cuando al excavar un kurgan que en ese momento se habia definido como caracteristico de un periodo no posterior al siglo x encontre en las manos del esqueleto una moneda del siglo xiv asi son las fluctuaciones los pueblos determinan estos problemas con mayor simplicidad para ellos todo lo que ha desaparecido se ha marchado al interior de la tierra
633138 de la lejana india partieron dos principes y dirigieron sus pasos hacia el norte en el camino uno de los principes murio y su hermano honro su memoria erigiendo sobre el una resplandeciente morada de enormes piedras y el mismo continuo su largo camino hacia las tierras desconocidas
633139 habeis oido decir ojo por ojo diente por diente pero yo os digo que si os pegan en una mejilla poned la otra
633140 alli encontrareis a un hombre con un cantaro y en ese lugar la celebraremos
633141 los hijos de los dioses se juntaron con las hijas de los hombres
633142 de no ser asi una interminable procesion venida de oeste este norte y sur inundaria nuestros remotos lugares donde sin ser invitado nadie perturbara nuestros estudios

633144 los prudentes de saben dominar las energias interiores y unirlas con las energias cosmicas
633145 una vez antes del alba mientras acampaba en los himalayas salio el mayor de su campamento y se dirigio a los barrancos vecinos a contemplar los majestuosos perfiles niveos de las monta as
633146 el sahib ha visto a uno de los hombres de nieve que custodian la region prohibida
633147 a esos hombvres de nieve se les ve muy raras veces

633157 if the chinese believe that the olympics failed or were badly tarnished because of foreign actions whether demonstrations or media coverage chinas reaction will be sharply negative
633158 this is perhaps the most exciting games weve ever broadcast
633159 people sometimes ask me why the hell did you give the games to beijing in 2001
633160 international olympic committee president jacques rogge said earlier this year

633162 they have infused large amounts of resources behind their sports programs
633163 theyve developed incredible olympic pipelines 2008 is just the beginning

633178 victoria says natto tastes weird and smells a bit horrible but you only have to eat a small portion to get the benefits she has just been having two small pots a day sometimes with rice
633179 she has been able to relax her super strict diet and eat and drink more of what she likes such as green tea ice cream and her all time favourite champagne david is very happy about it and victoria has already noticed a difference even though she has only eaten it for a couple of weeks

633187 the news another man is playing such a big part in beas life at this impressionable age will hurt sir paul he has to accept bea will spend time with any partners of heathers choice
633188 but its hard for him to accept because he has no control over who heather dates
633189 hes just feeling like any dad would in this situation slightly displaced
633190 heathers told anyone who will listen how smitten she is with jamie so sir paul will have to get used to jamie being around for a long time yet

633216 another stark reminder that torture is in and of itself a space that is that torture happens within a space as much as it defines a space even if it is out in the open for all to see
633217 sometimes only the simplest rudimentary unit of space is all that is required to constitute torture

633256 its important to note that the new estimate does not represent an actual increase in the number of new infections but reflects our ability to more precisely measure hiv incidence this new picture reveals that the hiv epidemic is and has been worse than previously known and underscores the challenges in confronting the disease

633259 very hot when we asked them for more information bush laughed and said when we share information with your guys the bad guys always run away
633260 the question is why its taken the americans so long to see what the isi is doing
633261 weve been telling them for years but they wouldnt buy it
633262 there is no involvement by the isi of any form in afghanistan
633263 the security of pakistan afghanistan the entire region and maybe that of the whole world will be determined by developments in the tribal areas over the next few months
633264 the indian embassy bombing seems to have finally provided it this is the smoking gun weve all been looking for
633265 what we were trying to do was bring national security and the war on terror under the interior ministry but it was wrongly announced
633266 they said they were still waiting for a signal to act in the tribal areas to be honest none of us could think of a thing they had done in six months
633267 we need to identify these people and weed them out
633268 it was the first thing i read on my blackberry when i got off the plane
633269 if you want to make a clever call on the bottom of the market you had best pay attention not in 2010 2011 or even 2017 the various years in which house price recovery has been tipped but now liam bailey knight franks head of research suggested this week that just as cash strapped homeowners are most inclined to avert their eyes the biggest bargains may be emerging
633270 my priority is to get into the starting 11 for the first game against west brom and go from there
633271 i will just keep working hard in the pre season games and training
633272 i found it quite tough in the first week but now ive settled in a bit
633273 me cummin back a skool wit a lighter n gasoline to bun out pemberton
633274 excuse me have you seen a blowfish driving a sports car
633275 id love to play him hes one of my favourites and there are some things in the pipeline
633276 if people are worried that because im taking over doctor who its going to be really really frightening well then tough
633277 christina is following the recommended treatment of her doctors and will have a full recovery
633278 the real problem was not the brilliance of the tory conference but the hubris and vacuity of our own this meant the tories by having something to say on policy appeared substantial and to represent the future
633279 there has been a lamentable confusion of tactics and strategy
633280 at present there is every indication that the lessons will not be learnt
633281 tony blair continues to be 100 percent supportive of gordon brown and the government
633282 the choice is and was always between gb gordon brown running as the change candidate or as continuity nl new labor
633283 by trying to be change he played exactly the same game the media wanted but never the game that gives us the only chance of a 4th term in office
633284 cdcs first estimates from this system reveal that the hiv epidemic is and has been worse than previously known results indicate that approximately 56 300 new hiv infections occurred in the united states in 2006
633285 this figure is roughly 40 percent higher than cdcs former estimate of 40 000 infections per year which was based on limited data and less precise methods
633286 though the number of new hiv infections remains unacceptably high
633287 the analysis shows that new infections peaked in the mid 1980s at approximately 130 000 infections per year and reached a low of about 50 000 in the early 1990s
633288 the data really confirm that there is a severe impact of this epidemic among gay and bisexual men in the united states as well as black men and women
633289 we need to develop programs that specifically target those most at risk such as african americans hispanics and men who have sex with men
633290 the reality is that it is a wake up call for all of us
633291 there are things that you and i can do to stop the disease encourage others to use condoms consistently and correctly abstain from sex
633292 it would of course be impractical to suggest living in a less hygienic environment or changing living conditions in order to afford possible protection from future development of ibd
633293 we tell the enemies of god that god has saved those who will be even more painful for you
633294 as abu khabab has gone he left behind with gods grace a generation of faithful students who will make you suffer the worst torture and avenge him and his brothers
633295 the direction by david eraserhead lynch is competent although he gives us an inexcusable opening scene in which merricks mother is trampled or scared by elephants or raped who knows and an equally idiotic closing scene in which merrick becomes the star child from 2001 or something
633296 dune looks like a project that was seriously out of control from the start sets were constructed actors were hired no usable screenplay was ever written everybody faked it as long as they could some shabby special effects were thrown into the pot and the producers crossed their fingers and hoped that everybody who has read the books will want to see the movie not if the word gets out they wont
633297 take away the surprises and you can see the method more clearly
633298 lost highway plays like a directors idea book in which isolated scenes and notions are jotted down for possible future use instead of massaging them into a finished screenplay lynch and collaborator barry gifford seem to have filmed the notes is the joke on us is it our error to try to make sense of the film to try to figure out why protagonists change in midstream lets say it is lets say the movie should be taken exactly as is with no questions asked then what do we have we still have just the notes for isolated scenes theres no emotional or artistic thread running through the material to make it seem necessary that its all in the same film together the giveaway is that the characters have no interest apart from their situation they exist entirely as creatures of the movies design and conceits
633299 because the film was directed by david lynch who usually deals in the bizarre
633300 but i warn you my dog is always with me
633301 lynchs latest film inland empire is stunning completely literary labyrinthine regressive its the best piece of art in any medium ive come across for years
633302 in terms of now i think some of the most interesting literary figures arent necessarily writers the films of david lynch for example have an extremely literary logic his latest inland empire is structured like finnegans wake or the novels of robbe grillet with a set of repetitions regressing inwards modulating as they repeat hes grappling with questions of narrative and representation and identity in a way that mainstream novelists simply arent and is therefore much more interesting as a writer even if he isnt strictly speaking one
633303 in the geological time of the arts finnegans wake happened a few seconds ago weve hardly even realized that its happened let alone set up a coordinated response the really good artists have realized and are responding look at david lynchs films or alain novels but most of the players in the mainstream cultural industries are trying to pretend it didnt happen or doesnt matter and theyll be washed away forgotten as a result
633304 the necessity and impossibility of watching yourself from the outside is what drives the picture of dorian gray or frankenstein or the films of david lynch
633305 i dont think that people accept the fact that life doesnt make sense i think it makes people terribly uncomfortable
633306 hes got this musical soul and melodies are always floating around inside i feel a mood of the scene in music and one thing helps the other and they both just start climbing
633307 lynch experimented with recording techniques just as he had during his innovative sound work on eraserhead placing microphones inside bottles and lengths of plastic tubing to try and capture a unique sound
633308 i like to make films because i like to go into another world i like to get lost in another world and film to me is a magical medium that makes you dream allows you to dream in the dark its just a fantastic thing to get lost inside the world of film
633309 ludwigs homosexuality can be seen as indicative of the passing of a monarchical system reliant upon hereditary and therefore compulsory heterosexuality this dovetails two themes patriarchal systems based upon physical reproduction have become outmoded and unstable a newer form of patriarchy is necessary to achieve stability for ludwig to express his desire even as a monarch means to regress from the social reality of the moment only when bavaria has been subjugated to prussia leaving a token monarchy can ludwig act out his desires in a limited way
633310 its been suggested that theres incest between hamlet and his mother in shakespeares play but between them theres lots of things in addition to the incest hamlet never actually has intercourse with his mother and even in my film the damned i was able to convince the censors that the scene was very elliptical however when i showed them the film with a tiny cut they asked for a much longer cut one which would have eliminated the whole scene so i refused and stuck to it i said i could have cut more of that scene but that i would have been forced to insert a counter camp and i said it would have made everything more graphic because you would actually see a naked man and a naked woman on a bed so i cut this counter camp in and i showed them the film again and they immediately agreed to go back to that only one tiny cut
633311 the damned won visconti his sole academy award nomination for best screenplay shared with his two co writers
633312 i can see it behind your eyes just listen to me im going to make you up im going to change your style im going to make you look like a woman in her thirties youre going to have beautiful clothes a beautiful set youre going to have beautiful people around you im going to put you into this place and youre going to have to do what you have to do i cant act for you i can do everything else for you but i cant act for you will you act for me
633313 visconti dramatizes alienation and madness in a very similar way that stanley kubrick handled similar themes in
633314 with the damned visconti reassures himself again a spot right up there into the pantheon of great directors one can see the influence of the damned on later films such as bob fosses cabaret or the psycho sexual drama the night porter the film was originally rated x due to its challenging subject matter but viscontis craft and talent elevates this epic drama to a higher artistic level with its brilliant set design spectacular costumes the intensity of helmut berger and ingrid thulin performances luchino viscontis the damned is a feverish masterpiece not to be discarded
633315 some shots of bj rn andr sen the tadzio of the film could be extracted from the frame and hung on the walls of the louvre or the vatican in rome for this is not a pretty youngster who is supposed to represent an object of perverted lust that was neither novelist manns nor director screen writer viscontis intention rather this is a symbol of a beauty allied to those which inspired michelangelos david and da vincis mona lisa and which moved dante to seek ultimate aesthetic catharsis in the distant figure of beatrice
633316 in his memoir an orderly man dirk bogarde relates that after the finished film of death in venice was screened for them by visconti in los angeles the warner bros executives wanted to write off the project fearing it would be banned in the united states for obscenity because of its subject matter they eventually relented when a gala premiere of the film was organized in london with queen elizabeth ii and princess anne in attendance to gather funds for the sinking city
633317 the only action in this film is what goes on within aschenbachs mind and it is by colouring the potentially neutral at times almost documentary scenes that visconti creates with the appropriate mood that he brings this film to life
633318 one would spontaneously put viscontis ludwig in the category of films that are bigger than cinema and more audacious than their time their mere existence challenges the dullness of daily life the materialism of the century and in this film of over proportionate ambition the filmmaker could not remain smaller than his subject ludwig no more than linderhof castle is meant to be inhabited
633319 in helmut bergers ludwig viscontis echt aestheticism finds its last champion its tristan and also its supreme sacrificial victim its christ ludwig is a passion play a mass
633320 in one powerful scene we follow ludwig into a room full of relatives through a complicated process of bowing and hand kissing
633321 ludwig is ultimately a man crushed and destroyed by architecture having been deposed by the government as mentally unfit to govern he is silently escorted by his captors in an interminable real time scene down an endless series of corridors to his bleak sterile cell it is at moments like this that viscontis leisurely pace turns almost sadistic yet the relentless oppressiveness of corridor after corridor is genuinely chilling and taken in the right spirit possesses a hypnotic mercilessly compacted power it is the natural conclusion to ludwigs ever contracting world a final imprisonment all that is left is his mysterious death by drowning the first time he is let out for a walk in the grounds
633322 left behind other experts who were trained by him it did not give details of how he and three other men died
633323 will not give up a single iota of its nuclear rights
633324 a clear signal for a mutual freeze we would freeze our sanctions efforts and iran the development of its centrifuges
633325 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
633326 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
633327 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
633328 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
633329 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
633330 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
633331 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
633332 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
633333 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
633334 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
633335 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
633336 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
633337 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
633338 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
633339 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
633340 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
633341 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
633342 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
633343 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
633344 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
633345 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
633346 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
633347 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
633348 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
633349 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
633350 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
633351 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently

633789 if we think about the wal mart model it is incredibly fuel intensive at every stage and at every one of those stages we are now seeing an inflation of the costs for boats trucks cars
633790 that is necessarily leading to a rethinking of this emissions intensive model whether the increased interest in growing foods locally producing locally or shopping locally
633791 each year you see more and more hispanic families walking through the fairs gates
633792 every year we seem to get a smaller portion of the general population
633793 people are not growing up with the fair like they did a generation ago
633794 its perceived that we have differences but they really dont exist
633795 the county fair is an american institution that is suffering
633796 they are learning that they are going to have to reinvent themselves
633797 it makes them remember their childhood their roots and their family
633798 it seems like people are finally taking notice of us
633799 whenever america targets and kills innocent people it comes up with such propaganda that it has killed a big personality in an attempt to justify the cruelty it has done
633800 it would be even painful if i was using regular
633801 if youre not using the horsepower that you have the potential for then the extra energy thats in the super gas is going to drive you further down the road
633802 super should be 60 cents more today its a better deal now
633803 if you want the car to perform at its maximum capability the best choice would not be 87
633804 there generally isnt any harm done to the engine by using lower octane fuel
633805 because our engines do have very good forms of knock sensing and are able to deal with lower octane fuels you will not have any drivability issues you will however lose some of the performance you have paid for
633806 epa fuels engineers say that there isnt a meaningful difference between regular and premium gasoline
633807 when i put the cheapest stuff in i get closer to 16 mpg
633808 but the difference is michael jordan was never expected to break a world record every time he competed no athlete in any sport has ever had the pressures and the expectations michael has on him now
633809 the great tiger woods competes and you know what people say about him that he has a good chance to win michael doesnt have that luxury he has to win
633810 i want to be the first michael phelps not the second mark spitz
633811 im just trying to do something thats never been done before
633812 and on the other side of the room ill hear my voice say in that powerbar commercial fear is good all my friends tell me they are sick of seeing me on television frankly i still am not used to it
633813 ive learned how to keep a little more reserve in my tank for when i need it every race i went for it even prelims i dont have to do that
633814 the difference between swimming the 100 butterfly and the 400 individual medley is like the difference between running one mile and running 15 miles
633815 i have been asked by a lot of my friends to get michaels autograph
633816 but im going to keep a few of them for myself
633817 you have to decide either be trampled under hamas shoes or stand in dignity
633818 we are sending a message that no one is above the law and that no family is above the law
633819 would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
633820 some people have said its the hardest of all the courses theyve had at the olympics
633821 obviously i felt like i could have done well at the same time it made me motivated for next year
633822 sent people walking onto the sidewalks so they could take a break from their jobs and talk about the earthquake and then get coffee before going back inside to check some news web sites until it was time to go home
633823 dude i wouldnt date her shes a 6 3 but her friend is a smoking 6 6
633824 although this is a very exciting development well be following closely for the next 48 hours no one in l a is dead injured or at all interested
633825 but the change has to be acceptable john kerry has to prove he is acceptable
633826 i did everything i could to get bush elected and re elected
633827 no no i the fact is that im different but the fact is that i have agreed with president bush far more than i have disagreed and on the transcendent issues the most important issues of our day ive been totally in agreement and support of president bush
633828 theres probably been a 300 percent increase in building out there in rural areas
633829 i cant tell you how many greenhouses i saw but im talking barns garages residences
633830 this could be a very easy way to find illegal unassessed properties at no cost to the county
633831 i dubbi avanzati dal presidente fini sulla ricostruzione dei fatti della strage di bologna sono del tutto legittimi dubbi che sono stati avanzati a pi riprese e da varie parti
633832 a suo tempo stato stabilito un singolare teorema politico a senso unico per definizione la strage deve essere fascista i suoi autori sono mambro e fioravanti chi mette in discussione questi due assiomi fascista o amico dei fascisti
633833 i marittimi del peschereccio valeria prima di mazara stanno bene tutto lequipaggio a bordo allinterno del porto commerciale di tripoli

633842 en una entrevista que publica destacada en la portada del diario
633843 m s como ina ambici n que como un an lisis t cnico
633844 si me planteo ahora la decisi n se seguir esta legislatura igual me arrepiento
633845 desde hace dos meses hay algunos datos radicalmente diferentes como la subida del petr leo o de los tipos de inter s que nos pueden dar la idea de que la situaci n econ mica es peor de la que preve amos todos nosotros pens bamos que iba a ir algo m s lento y al final ha ido m s r pido
633846 si no nos da m s sorpresas el petr leo si no hay otras variables con impacto negativo pensamos que vamos a tener una situaci n de muy bajo crecimiento o crecimiento plano en los pr ximos trimestres pero no estamos pensando en una recesi n
633847 si los precios del petr leo se estabilizan a partir de septiembre deber amos empezar a ver una ca da de la inflaci n a fin de a o deber a estar en el entorno de 4 o incluso por debajo y en europa cerca del 3 el bce est m s preocupado por las expectativas de inflaci n y esa evoluci n afectar tambi n a su reflexi n
633848 pero son decisiones que el bce adoptar de acuerdo con su estrategia de pol tica monetaria

633856 assembling to march and protest is a citizens right but it must be stressed that when exercising this right citizens must respect and not harm others freedoms and rights and must not harm national social and collective interests
633857 im so moved its been a long wait even if we have to wait for hours it is worthwhile
633858 the torch represents peace and harmony the olympic spirit will give us strength to rebuild
633859 theres a lot of glory in having the torch come here this is our way of showing our support
633860 he was the maddest human being i think ive ever seen
633861 maddest baseball player ive ever seen for sure i dont think ive ever seen anyone madder than george brett at that moment in time
633862 i have no idea what id have done if nobody stopped me but it wouldnt have been pretty
633863 if ive heard the words pine tar once ive heard them nine million times
633864 id like to forget it to be honest with you but people wont let me
633865 i was out there laughing my head off i thought it was hilarious
633866 george got the last laugh he hit a game winning homer and i got a blown save and a loss
633867 i didnt like any hitters i had tremendous respect for him but i couldnt stand george brett back then
633868 i never said a word to goose when we were playing
633869 i played with him in all star games played against him in all star games played against him in yankee stadium and played against him when he was with other american league teams but i never said a word to him
633870 greatest hitter i ever faced in his prime when i was in my prime
633871 he kept us off balance moved the ball around the strike zone and just off the strike zone
633872 the big innings that i have given up this year the changeup has been up i havent really been able to locate it down in the zone
633873 i felt good early maybe threw too many pitches maybe wore myself out and it just boiled down to leaving a couple pitches up
633874 then apple came along and in a 30 second commercial they just made it dead simple
633875 the iphone has repositioned at amp t as the premier wireless brand in the world
633876 this changes what you see and how people interact socialize and communicate
633877 to me that was the standout of the whole iphone deal
633878 we believe that over the long term the subsidized iphone 3g will drive increased sales volume and revenues among high quality data centric customers
633879 the 199 price point should be a big hit with consumers
633880 this is going to bring in a whole new demographic
633881 its a no brainer that if you bring down cost more people will buy it
633882 you dont do that by making little incremental moves youve got to make big moves
633883 youve just got to be right more than youre wrong
633884 wir sind aufgefordert gegen jegliche bestrebungen die gleichgeschlechtlich ausgepr gt sind vorzugehen

633890 in recent months i have heard some analysts suggest that the current economic situation is not like the 1970s because unions are less prevalent and there is no evidence as yet of a wage price spiral thus a weak economy with rising unemployment and declining payroll employment will presumably prevent workers from demanding higher wages but again that story has things backwards it is not demands for higher wages that kick off the spiral but the loss of confidence that the central bank will keep inflation controlled which in turn leads to a rise in inflation expectations the wage price spiral is not the cause of the inflation but the result this means that if monetary policymakers wait until they see the evidence of a wage price spiral they will be too late the public will have lost confidence in the feds ability to keep inflation under control and this will make the job of bringing inflation down much more costly and difficult
633891 the cancer is not life threatening she is following the recommended treatment of her doctors and will have a full recovery
633892 i thought about it for a moment and agreed i had to drive away from the camera down coronation street and make a right turn
633893 wardrobe dressed me to look just like the character nina with a top headscarf and really big sunglasses everyone thought it was hilarious and the scene went well i am told it will be on screen on monday august 4
633894 i never imagined i would be dressing up as a woman particularly a bollywood star when i was driving to the studio that day
633895 she had to sit in the car for scenes where she chatted up dev thankfully i wasnt needed on set for those that really would have been a giveaway
633896 they told me they needed an old jaguar xjs convertible preferably in black which is exactly my car
633897 it has a six litre v12 engine so it was nice of them to pay me 200 although the 500 mile round trip cost me 185 in petrol
633898 but thats fine i was glad of the experience and it was great fun even dressing up as a woman i didnt know much about corrie so i needed to bone up a bit before i went the cast and crew were lovely it all seemed very relaxed and professional
633899 we needed norman to drive the car for a couple of shots it worked out really well

633903 carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is the product of oceanic respiration due to the well known but under appreciated solubility pump carbon dioxide rises out of warm ocean waters where it is added to the atmosphere there it is mixed with residual and accidental co2 and circulated to be absorbed into the sink of the cold ocean waters next the thermohaline circulation carries the co2 rich sea water deep into the ocean a millennium later it appears at the surface in warm waters saturated by lower pressure and higher temperature to be exhausted back into the atmosphere throughout the past 420 millennia comprising four interglacial periods the vostok record of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration is imprinted with and fully characterized by the physics of the solubility of co2 in water along with the lag in the deep ocean circulation notwithstanding that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas atmospheric carbon dioxide has neither caused nor amplified global temperature increases increased carbon dioxide has been an effect of global warming not a cause technically carbon dioxide is a lagging proxy for ocean temperatures when global temperature and along with it ocean temperature rises the physics of solubility causes atmospheric co2 to increase if increases in carbon dioxide or any other greenhouse gas could have in turn raised global temperatures the positive feedback would have been catastrophic while the conditions for such a catastrophe were present in the vostok record from natural causes the runaway event did not occur carbon dioxide does not accumulate in the atmosphere

633954 assembling to march and protest is a citizens right but it must be stressed that when exercising this right citizens must respect and not harm others freedoms and rights and must not harm national social and collective interests
633955 for me going three in a row i certainly realise the attention and expectation that comes with that
633956 but at the same time i probably feel more relaxed with this than i felt in the past two games
633957 touch wood everything is going according to plan this time i was always looking forward to these olympics and i have prepared myself physically and mentally
633958 there are so many rivals this time round and more depth than ever now you just have to go out there give it your best shot and the results will talk for themselves

633966 i worked so hard that whole year to come back and i wanted to get my floor title back after not even making it to finals in 2006
633967 but if anything having her come in and being such a good competitor just pushed us hard to achieve more it was a motivational thing for me to work harder
633968 im personally glad it was now in 2007 because i knew i needed to go home and work harder and get up my level of difficulty to give her a good fight in
633969 its such a great accomplishment to have someone from your own country win the olympics but it was a little hard to watch as i would have liked to have been at that olympic games

633993 president mugabe attaches great importance to the ongoing talks which is why he is not going to china for the grand opening of the olympics
633994 clearly he is aware that unlike the unity palaver with pf zapu in the 1980s the current talks involve a political minotaur shaped and disfigured by a complex web of external interests whose sole goal is to teach revolutionary southern africa a sound lesson by defeating zanu pf
633995 the main reason why mugabe would not attend such an occasion is that his status as president is being questioned not just abroad but in his own country
633996 that is why he is so anxious to see the ongoing talks succeeding as this would settle the outstanding issue of his legitimacy

634206 i play basketball and im getting this chance to be part of the olympics its about the basketball for me not politics not anything else i was going to play basketball this summer and this seems like a great way to do it
634207 people calling me traitor on the radio and stuff i dont understand that its basketball i love my country
634208 its scary that people get so carried away with politics when its supposed to be about the sports
634209 i understand that but i could get hurt in the summer league or just about doing anything
634210 after that last game in greece he sat on the floor just crying he thanked me for helping
634211 i mean i felt great for him he has been trying to do this for 12 years and i had been there for 12 days it means so much to him
634212 i gave my word to dirk to the german officials
634213 and i knew i wouldnt be going to the olympics with the u s team
634214 i would do my best to help my team win because its basketball and thats what you do
634215 a couple of the games have been strange especially with the officials calling things and the ball being slippery but you live and you learn
634216 a pick and roll is still a pick and roll and a post up is still a post up
634217 besides on this team you can go to dirk hes one of the best players in the world and hes just been unstoppable
634218 it reminds me of playing at central michigan where everybody was like a family and you hung out and stuff
634219 im not worrying about it now because i cant control it
634220 it sounds like we will have different guys i know i just want to win i hope we have guys who want to win thats what basketball should be about

634447 i have decided to scalp you and burn your village to the ground
634448 and a year from now ill be very surprised if there is not some grand square in baghdad that is named after president bush there is no doubt that with the exception of a very small number of people close to a vicious regime the people of iraq have been liberated and they understand that theyve been liberated and it is getting easier every day for iraqis to express that sense of liberation
634449 the isi is a very disciplined organization manned by military officials it has played the most crucial role in the war on terror and apprehended members of al qaeda the taliban and those linked to the attack on mainland america on 9 11
634450 despite our insistence no evidence has been provided to us about these allegations
634451 weve long noted the troubling reports of a relationship between the isi and the taliban and the incident at the indian embassy seems to fit the pattern of those reports
634452 there seems to be a bit of sensationalism in this story
634453 there was new information showing that members of the pakistani intelligence service were increasingly providing militants with details about the american campaign against them in some cases allowing militants to avoid american missile strikes in pakistans tribal areas
634454 i have decided to scalp you and burn your village to the ground
634455 the americans have all along known about the isis collaboration with the taliban they knew the political leadership of the taliban including mullah omar were in quetta they knew when jalaluddin haqqani was in pakistan earlier it didnt suit their interest to admit this but now that the fellows trained to fight in kashmir are fighting in afghanistan and killing american soldiers theyre feeling the heat
634456 weve been shouting this from the rooftops for years now given the situation in afghanistan there is growing frustration within the u s about pakistans two timing but theres no telling whether this is a one off scolding or will translate into longer term action hopefully there will be more trouble for the isi ahead
634457 indias problem is its weak leadership and lack of a coherent counterterror strategy it is not an accident that according to the u s after iraq india is the biggest victim of terrorism in the world
634458 i have decided to scalp you and burn your village to the ground

634490 i have struggled with my weight for my whole life and pregnancy obviously does crazy things to you
634491 so when my daughter was 3 months old i looked for a place she could be with me when i got in shape i never thought i could enjoy exercising
634492 my baby loves it near the end of the class we put the kids on a big mat where they can play together and interact
634493 my husband accepted a new job and we moved from baton rouge la where i was attending strollerfit
634494 i checked to see if there were any classes in this area and i couldnt find anything so i decided to open one myself
634495 we meet the needs of all fitness levels and incorporate music nursery rhymes and games into class to make it fun for both mom and baby
634496 strollerfit is a total body workout while building your mommy muscles you are also incorporating cardio strength and resistance
634497 the faster someone burns off the extra weight that most new moms carry the better but they should increase their activity level gradually
634498 if exercise isnt hurting you you can do almost anything that doesnt produce pain
634499 i had tried my local gym but my daughter hated their day care and it was a nightmare now she likes the floor exercises and plays while were in a circle around them sweating

634506 im really glad i finished im really glad im on land
634507 it wasnt really a great weather day and i didnt swim as fast as i had hoped i was swimming against the wind at the end of the first crossing
634508 i was so tired from the first and i just did the best i could
634509 i was feeling pretty frustrated at the end of the first crossing and i almost couldnt look at him because i started to cry when i saw him paddling next to me

634515 in my opinion hamas will quickly discover it committed a very big act of stupidity that will be difficult to resolve
634516 we have to decide on one central and basic position and that is that we cooperate and want to help the pragmatic forces among the palestinians those who want to negotiate with us and who are fighting the radical islam of hamas

634518 if i do play well if i do start playing well like i did today i think i would be an addition to the team
634519 and if i dont play well i would not be i would not expect a pick i just want to play as well as i can and see where it takes me
634520 im a long way out of it at the moment and i need to show excellent form
634521 ive got four tournaments left and i need to play well in those if i do he may consider me for a pick if i dont ill be watching it on tv like everybody else
634522 all summer long and probably the past three to four months ive pushed and pushed and pushed and tried too hard and practised too hard and worked too hard
634523 ive wanted to play too well too much whereas now im just playing and enjoying it and seeing what that brings
634524 its really good to get back on to pure greens again as good as these are and start rolling in those four or five footers to save par
634525 i havent been making those this year and that puts me on the back foot straightaway like anybody ive gone back to my old method wider stance and slightly higher hands

634527 this decree is indefinite and it will be enforced in the new season in january 2009
634528 it may be seen as a backtrack measure but we have to bear in mind that this is the only way to raise our football standard
634529 after years of allowing import players to play in our leagues they did not improve our football standard at all
634530 now will i rise and make oppressors flee i shall appear to their surprise and set my servants free
634531 not only can cardio kickboxing pack a knockout punch for your fitness goals but judging by the expressions on the faces of its participants the activity is also a knee slapping good time

634535 valeri was probably the big bonus from the draw at stockport
634536 it was important that he was able to get on the pitch clear his mind that he is free from injury now we can move forward it is up to the strikers to grab the initiative and show what they can do and he did that for the short time he was on the pitch
634537 we have high hopes that he will come back bigger faster and stronger because his work in training is really explosive and dynamic and once he has worked on his match fitness that will help us
634538 it was great he scored at the end where our fans were because he relates to them and you can see and sense that they relate to him

634541 all those who are irrelevant to acts shaking the security will be immediately released and returned to their families and houses
634542 those who resorted to the zionist occupation should not have done so because this is their home and they should not have left it

634549 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will
634550 its not necessarily james bond like spying where you have some super spy penetrating the deepest u s secrets
634551 its trying relentlessly to get defense related technology from u s companies u s engineers and the u s military
634552 im not the person who can say anything about that
634553 but i do believe the club are working hard to get a solution
634554 we knew it was going to be a very complicated matter that it was not easy
634555 its not going to be easy for ronaldo to come to real madrid
634556 do i still want to sign ronaldo what a question of course if you ask any football coach that question every single one of them would want ronaldo
634557 every coach has a lot of objectives and he is a player who would help you achieve those objectives
634558 weve got to wait to see what will happen in the transfer market with regard to signing a new striker but what wayne did last season was staggering
634559 he had to take the responsibility of leading the line on his shoulders and he was awesome
634560 he played out of position a lot he played on the left and sacrificed himself so many times for the team
634561 i know the manage wants to see wayne playing in his more accustomed position just off the front
634562 maybe that will happen if we sign a striker and then youll see how dangerous he can be
634563 as soon as he came on he got us playing you never lose that ability he created a few chances and forced a brilliant save out of their goalkeeper
634564 i have had the best players in the world around me
634565 that makes it easy for forwards you dont have to work hard creating chances for yourself they do it for you
634566 the fact i had that and played for the best manager in the world in front of the best supporters makes me feel very humble
634567 when ole arrived coach jim ryan was the only one who had heard of him
634568 jim had been over to see him and recommended to the manager that we sign him i am glad we did
634569 testimonials dont happen very often and it says a lot for ole that he stayed here long enough to receive one
634570 there were probably times in his career when he might not have played as much football as he liked
634571 but he always got himself ready for the games how many times did he come on and change a match for us
634572 none of the lads are quite at 100 yet but every game helps

634910 si bien hay como una suerte de disparate en el planteo inicial en eso de buscarle un novio a mi esposa hay una cosa muy fuerte y real que pasa por otro lado la peli habla del desgas te de la convivencia de animarse de revisar lo cotidiano y cuando parece que el problema lo tiene ella se ve que en realidad lo tiene l es una comedia que habla claramente del amor

634915 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while
634916 this puts a key part of the dashboard in place
634917 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic
634918 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history
634919 evidence of a failure by government and society to do what it takes to control the epidemic
634920 we have been inadequately funding this epidemic all along we need to step it up

634928 as far back as the year 2000 the respondent has actually attempted to murder several other people either through poisoning he is a revenge killer when he feels that hes been slighted or has had especially toward women he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings
634929 has been forensically diagnosed by several top psychiatrists as a sociopathic homicidal killer i have that in evidence and through my working with him i also believe that to be very true
634930 very important that the fbi present their case against bruce and not just state that the investigation was over because it was him and hes gone
634931 im concerned about what closing this case without conclusive evidence might do to harm our life sciences enterprise i think we as americans need to see the proof
634932 very important that the fbi present their case against bruce and not just state that the investigation was over because it was him and hes gone
634933 im concerned about what closing this case without conclusive evidence might do to harm our life sciences enterprise i think we as americans need to see the proof
634934 its a shame the man is not here with us we might have known more
634935 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure
634936 client has a history dating to his graduate days of homicidal threats plans and actions towards therapists
634937 were closest to tiki island in terms of being a canal community in demographics houses lifestyle and everything is way over their payroll especially our police chief
634938 our chief of police makes quite a bit more than theirs it looks unusual to me
634939 when talking about budget cuts its a charade of insiders giving smoke and mirrors
634940 we spent 31 2 hours at a meeting and never discussed anything of significance its business as usual at bayou vista ive requested that the council take a hard look at our budget
634941 i have to plead ignorance because i raised my hand to approve it
634942 our accountants sent us a letter last year saying we do a very good job with the budget
634943 i think we run a very tight budget i think weve got some good people and we want to pay them appropriately
634944 their chief makes less but they provide uniforms and he has a lot more benefits
634945 im afraid mr janek wants to pay them 11 an hour and have nothing but turnover and confusion in our city
634946 tiki island doesnt have a daily collection of swimming pool passes nor do they have a recreation center thats rented out the clerk takes care of those duties
634947 weve got some really good people who are being treated unfairly and i take offense to that
634948 they said they might not have lived if it hadnt been for the screening
634949 there is a business side to this health care costs are expensive and if we dont manage it they can get out of control
634950 this is a way to manage it and the side benefits to this are remarkable better morale and happier healthier people
634951 but then they started asking what are you doing in the area of wellness and they discussed different things people do there
634952 were seeing some fairly dramatic improvements in the health of employees
634953 so i can design wellness initiatives to help combat or improve those wellness scores
634954 this a strategy of chronic and regular communication and an opportunity for people to keep themselves healthier
634955 its a great service to our community and to our staff our employees cant get these kind of tests done for the price that mainland offers to us
634956 early detection is a huge factor in health and wellness
634957 our program is a win win because we are focused on the needs of both the employer and the employee
634958 health care is the largest cost of doing business today and employers are having to pay more
634959 what we do is say lets work together lets make the right things happen
634960 thats been a goal from the beginning its just a matter of getting the money
634961 its going to take a hell of a lot of money
634962 i cant wait to sleep in this bed im gonna have the best week ever
634963 if nicole wins the show i just think about the originals that have been in from the beginning
634964 we think around 68 people have died and many are injured
634965 i cant wait until to get you all to myself
634966 i still think that divide is coming down soon more stuff will happen because were together fun stuff
634967 maximum two more weeks but i think this is the last week
634968 once we can all be in the same room theyll take it down
634969 tough dale you can hate me forever but im going to be fair
634970 last year i warned county policymakers that our reliance on sales tax revenue as our largest source of revenue could negatively impact our budget if an economic downturn occurs
634971 the city of niagara falls plans and millions in federal funding for this new station have been tangled in red tape for far too long
634972 each speaker will just log in at her his scheduled time with a plugged in microphone speak about their topic approximately 30 40 minutes and then hold a q a session with the listeners approximately 20 30 minutes
634973 but i think that what perhaps disturbs me the most about saxon is to read through it i myself do not get the feeling that i am reading something that when that the children use it they would even have a remotely correct impression of what mathematics is about it is extremely
634974 i am a homeschooling mom with two children still at home
634975 its ok if they dont master this now because theyll see it again later
634976 its funny but even with all the resources we currently have on hand i find that we spend more time on real life math such as calculating tip when we eat out
634977 in the 19th century infinitesimals were replaced by limits limits describe the value of a function at a certain input in terms of its values at nearby input they capture small scale behavior just like infinitesimals but using ordinary numbers from this viewpoint calculus is a collection of techniques for manipulating certain limits infinitesimals get replaced by very small numbers and the infinitely small behavior of the function is found by taking the limiting behavior for smaller and smaller numbers limits are easy to put on rigorous foundations and for this reason they are the standard approach to calculus
634978 his invention calculus did seem to explain the way the stars and planets without gods help
634979 sixty eight people are confirmed dead and 45 others are injured
634980 about 80 people have died and about 30 people are injured
634981 a lot of people were confined in a small area
634982 we think around 68 people have died and many are injured
634983 i am very pleased with my run and it felt great to finally get behind the wheel of an indycar im happy to be able to have this opportunity to show what i can do
634984 the car felt faster then what i am used to but it didnt feel quite as fast as i thought it would
634985 it is much more physical to handle then my indy lights car but i got used to that quite quickly i want to thank team owner john barnes for giving me the opportunity and also want to thank vitor race engineer david cripps and the rest of the crew for helping me out during the test
634986 i was impressed with the way that dillon drove the car
634987 he adjusted quickly which is not an easy thing to do and was pretty fast
634988 and more difficult than i had thought it would be in the end i managed to reach q3 and i am happy about that it means we can approach the race sensibly and i hope we can make the most of this grid position to score some points
634989 probably the most under recognized blog in the jblogsphere as far as i am concerned

634994 in todays economy companies all over the world are looking to optimize all areas of operations especially in the contact center
634995 aspect software continues to gain a competitive advantage in the emea region implementing superior market strategies that recognize the particular challenges of that region stringent local labor regulations as well as a very complex contact center environment in emea by creating applications that directly address those issues aspect is creating a market leading differentiator
634996 companies in the emea market are looking for advanced performance optimization solutions to help them do more with fewer resources and that also meet their specific local needs
634997 having frost amp sullivan consistently recognize our leadership in the workforce management market over the last several years is very important to aspect software this award is another proof point that companies around the world have truly begun to recognize the value of performanceedge and its innovative workforce management capabilities
634998 my direct appeal is for every employer in australia when the government delivers and when the aboriginal leaders and the aboriginals themselves deliver work mentor ready aboriginal people to you to employ we ask you to step out to your major role your major part in breaking at last the aboriginal social and monetary poverty cycle and employ these aboriginals
634999 a three to four month short course which is crammed with the industry details specific to that aboriginals future job is what has always been required and what the government is promising to deliver
635000 first i looked at pictures of a lot of houses online then i drove by the ones i liked that weeded it down to the few i saw in person
635001 especially with the cost of gas today the sunday drive to check out neighborhoods and houses is a thing of the past
635002 to sell a house today you should have pictures and videos of the houses features and ideally the neighborhood too
635003 the buyer has lots and lots of houses to choose from so the sellers pictures have to grab the buyer
635004 you have to sell the lifestyle not the house use plenty of pictures and show the buyer what makes the house special which is not necessarily the front view
635005 if there werent any pictures of a house it made me wonder what the seller was hiding
635006 some pictures were just plain deceiving one had what appeared to be a pond in the front yard but it turned out to be a puddle but we found those who had lots of good pictures of their houses tended to be the people who took care of their houses and were proud of them
635007 if the seller just showed an outside picture we didnt even look at it because we wondered what was wrong with the inside
635008 some people actually had pictures of rooms with dirty laundry on the floor or beds that werent made
635009 one house looked great in the pictures but reeked of cigarette smoke
635010 others had great pictures but upclose needed a lot of work like new siding
635011 this house is small and dark and straight out of the 60s the only reason to buy this is to tear it down
635012 the building wasnt built when we bought so the virtual view feature was critical to our decision
635013 we knew the view to the east would be of the lake but theres a hotel to the north and without the virtual view feature we would not have known if the hotel would have blocked the view or not
635014 we had been burned before so we wanted a developer with a good reputation we used the internet to read every story we could find about the company
635015 we saw that it had a park right next door which is perfect for us because we have four young kids
635016 i noticed your way of doing things is very meek and very quiet
635017 that doesnt work here you have to get that authoritative voice when that nice voice isnt working dont be afraid of them dont be their friend you are in charge of that classroom
635018 christina is following the recommended treatment of her doctors and will have a full recovery
635019 one team got chased by elephants but that wasnt us i wish that was us
635020 you get to see the slums and then the best golf course in all of india people are amazing they are all willing to help people out because everyone has hardships and there are so many colors and so many stimulations and the heat and humidity
635021 we were coming out of calcutta and there were strikes against high oil prices going on so people were stabbing tires and cars were being set on fire we had to leave at like 5 a m
635022 a car on our right veered left and sabhlok tried to steer away and it toppled to the right and skidded about 150 feet
635023 but he flew back to the finish line at the end
635024 we got our adventure ive been telling stories to everyone whenever i talk to people about it i tell them about it and then we instantly become friends that phrase what doesnt kill you makes you stronger i think i finally get it we were so thankful for our lives after that accident
635025 you dont really know what a billion people is like until you go to india
635026 they really want to get to know you so they just come up and start talking they are really hospitable and interested in what we were doing some rural places are barely ever seen by americans
635027 the whole point is to get in as much trouble as possible
635028 if there was security in the south why would we come here
635029 we will stay here even for 10 years until the bombardment ends
635030 do you know the taliban entered kandahar city and broke into the prison
635031 there were armored vehicles on the hill and they were firing there was a heavy bombardment and planes bombed too
635032 they did not differentiate between the guilty and not guilty
635033 we left our houses because we had no power to resist the taliban or the government
635034 anytime the taliban fired a shot from our houses then the coalition the government and the police came to the area and hit us
635035 the government comes and arrests us and then the taliban come and arrest us as well
635036 there was fighting in the village a hundred times roadside bombs bombardment firing and shooting
635037 the taliban are coming during the night with heavy weapons riding on vehicles and we cannot even dare ask them to leave because if they see someone at night outside they will slaughter them and accuse them of being spies
635038 his mother was cooking and he was lying beside her
635039 the whole village was destroyed and after that we left
635040 we dont know from which side they fired but we heard that
635041 if the taliban fire from over there do you come and bomb this village
635042 we only want a stable country whether with the taliban or the foreigners
635043 if they kill if they wound innocent people we dont want them
635044 if they build and bring peace we will accept them
635045 the kind of legislator that represents the next generation of leaders
635046 he said peter those are not our people theyll never be our people were not going to do anything
635047 youre fired you were rubbish anyway you have no future your home has been demolished and ive killed your dog
635048 this is the way the world ends not with a bang but a whimper
635049 the fairest possible distribution of the necessities and comforts of daily life
635050 it was a time when churchill perceiving the dangers that lay ahead struggled to mobilise the political will and industrial energy of the british empire to meet those dangers he did so often in the face of strong opposition
635051 climate change is the gathering storm of our generation and the implications should we fail to act could be no less dire and perhaps even more so

635060 for too long state government has spent and spent with little regard for taxpayers money
635061 we are striving for an efficient state government that operates transparently and wisely invests taxpayer money in state priorities
635062 many of them who serve in the legislature they serve for this very reason
635063 they serve to be able to bring money back to their districts
635064 it serves the only hot meal some people get every day
635065 found 90 000 of the cash in the freezer in 10 000 increments wrapped in aluminum foil and stuffed inside frozen food containers
635066 i clearly made a mistake by telling the legislature that i would allow them to handle their own internal affairs and that i would stay out of this page
635067 we are extremely disappointed that the louisiana house of representatives chose to pass a pay increase that resisted the ultimate will of the people despite the fact that the house members reduced the pay raise from 300 to 200 there is still no exception for disregarding the thousands of phone calls letters and emails from residents all over the state pleading for legislators to stand up against this self serving increase in their annual salary
635068 maybe it was just too good to be true a hugely popular governor getting pretty much everything he and the voters asked for in the way of ethics reform a move which has put a new face on louisiana sweeping behind decades of corruption greed and backroom deals governor jindal says he doesnt like the pay raise its overboard but he says he will not veto this outrageous affront to the voters legislators asked us to give them their jobs fully knowing what the pay was everyone whose fingerprints are now on this awful legislation should hang their heads in shame and turn in their political badges many of our people are struggling with wages they can barely get by on our legislators should be ashamed of themselves we urge governor jindal to veto sb 672 its the right thing to do
635069 gov bobby jindal said wednesday he would let a bill that would triple legislators pay become law rather than use his veto pen jindal said he did not want to give legislators a reason to sidetrack the bills he wants passed
635070 lets not wait till youre watching on tv and seeing that its two days off the coast because it will be so much more difficult to find the supplies to gather the medicines the food the water the batteries i guarantee you that stores will run out of those supplies
635071 it is all based on a 30 year old defunct model of thinking and it means that when they wake up to this one really our cost is going to increase significantly
635072 you ask a tough question we have been discussing this for months without a decision we lean toward coming back and have looked at properties on two recent visits unfortunately susan has this visceral fear of hurricanes that sidetracks us each time we are getting plugged in in cincinnati and it has its charms still we miss our friends back home at least if n o metairie is still home our lease forces us to make a decision by the end of august we are spending much of august on an alaskan cruise and i suspect it will be a major topic of discussion on the trip
635073 it is clear is that this change will slow the prosecution of ethics cases already in the works likely create a backlog of investigations and discourage violators from admitting guilt when they think the evidence of their offense is slim
635074 my understanding is there is some disagreement between the ethics board and some of those members and our attorneys about what the appropriate standards should be
635075 take a comprehensive look at fixing the broken lawsuit system
635076 the best thing louisiana can do to attract business is to have a balanced legal system
635077 an unfair legal system sucks the life out of a states economy it slows business expansion it kills jobs and it takes money out of consumers pockets
635078 our findings suggest that severe damage to ones home is a particularly important factor behind socioeconomic disparities in psychological distress and possibly behind the levels of psychological distress these effects may be partly economic because for most families who own their home home equity is the largest element of household wealth
635079 perception is the first reason our citizens returned and more new people are moving into our community
635080 it is important very important that the world continues to know the truth about new orleans and the fact that we are still a major city and we are recovering and the recovery grows every day
635081 new orleans has always been a beacon for people with imagination daring and alternative approaches to solving problems our mission is to attract these types of people to new orleans and provide them with the information and resources they need to start their businesses here
635082 silicon valley became the nerve center for technology in the u s because of the investment businesses in the region made in attracting and retaining technology people
635083 the same can be said for new york city with financial people what were doing here in new orleans is making this the city of choice for entrepreneurs if youre smart motivated and have a track record of success we want you here
635084 with her win in the democratic primary victoria wulsin won a second chance tuesday to face off against republican incumbent jean schmidt in ohios 2nd congressional district beating steve black by a decisive margin in the democratic primary
635085 schmidt said facing wulsin again will be easier than in 2006
635086 the authorities claim that the demolition of public housing is not intentionally discriminatory
635087 the past model of public housing in new orleans has been a failed one years of neglect and mismanagement left our public housing developments in ruin
635088 these are critical times in our citys history we can choose to continue on the path of progress and positive change or we can choose to maintain the status quo
635089 our people at the base camp have confirmed the deaths of two nepalese and three koreans
635090 his body was found near the camp 3 and was buried by the fellow climbers
635091 we are still hopeful that he is alive around a dozen climbers and porters are trying today to find him and the other missing people
635092 we know he has a sat phone but it looks like its battery has given out
635093 all depends on weather which changes after five minutes over there
635094 such an operation is practically impossible since the helicopters we have cannot fly at 8 000 metre altitude
635095 we have counted at least 100 bodies and most of the victims were children and women the death toll may rise up to 125
635096 the stampede took place after a railing on the staircase that leads upto the temple collapsed because of the surging crowds
635097 there was a lot of commotion in the narrow area the roads in the area have been blocked for general traffic so we can provide speedy evacuation of the injured to hospitals
635098 the ioc considers blogging as a legitimate form of personal expression and not as a form of journalism
635099 in any event blogs containing olympic content should at all times conform to the olympic spirit and the fundamental principles of olympism as contained in the olympic charter and be dignified and in good taste
635100 the reason is that in the olympic village there are 205 national olympic committees the olympic village is a microcosm of the world
635101 many people were killed in the stampede which took place after a railing on the way to the temple collapsed
635102 we have counted at least 100 bodies and most of the victims were children and women the death toll may rise up to 125

635148 if they report for work on or after 1 november they should be asked to leave the premises as they are no longer an employee of leeds city council
635149 it is an extreme act to dismiss people especially this many our members feel they cannot trust the council any more because of this extreme action
635150 for an organisation to come along and dismiss people who may have worked loyally for the council for 20 or 30 years to enforce an unfair pay system is wrong
635151 over 10 000 of our staff are better off under the new structure and their pay has actually increased
635152 regrettably there are a small number of colleagues who may be adversely affected under the new structure
635153 the council is working closely with the trade unions to review wherever possible services jobs and methods of working to reduce the loss to employees
635154 the next stage of the process is the termination and immediate re engagement of contracts for 1 100 employees whose jobs experience a reduction in basic pay and for whom protection arrangements are in place
635155 it is with regret that the council has to take this action however it is now the only remaining method of implementing national
635156 this is regrettable but it is now the only remaining method of implementing the national single status agreement that will ensure the councils pay structure complies with equal pay legislation

635183 among other things that teacher risked the safety of his students in taking such a cavalier attitude toward dance instruction it is unfortunately all too often that we see people in nightclubs and at social events literally throwing themselves or their partner around the room in the name of dancing the risk of injury to limbs and major joints e g elbow shoulder neck feet knees and ankles is very real not to mention the danger to fellow dancers on the floor

635221 t he phone hasnt stopped ringing at his familys home in ludhiana the busy industrial hub of punjab but the kudos is about more than singhs impressive singing prowess he has earned it by the fact that he is a keshdhari turban wearing sikh
635222 it is his sabat surat appearance conforming to the sikh ideal that has brought him where he is today
635223 he has shown other sikh boys that they dont need a trendy hairstyle to attain stardom
635224 founded by guru nanak in northern india during the 15th century sikhism drew from sufism islam and hinduism but rejected what it saw as their worst traditions such as the hindu caste system the religion claims 23 million followers today 76 percent of whom live in the indian state of punjab but the battle to preserve the turban may well be the toughest facing the sikhs since they were first rallied as a martial nation by their tenth guru gobind singh in 1699 to fight the oppressive mughal rulers of india
635225 a turban is a sikhs pride and i dont want my son to shear his hair once he becomes more independent

635263 the states budget of over rs one lakh crore is the highest in the country and higher than even our neighbouring country bangladesh
635264 after taking into account the overall transactions of the year we will have a net surplus of rs 134 crore rs 1 34 billion the financial year 2008 09 is expected to end with a cash balance of rs 120 crore rs 1 2 billion
635265 this year the plan size is proposed to be 43 percent of the budget against 32 percent last year
635266 for the fourth consecutive year we have been able to manage the state finances without resorting to the ways and means advances from the rbi reserve bank of india
635267 the state has earned a revenue surplus of about rs 2 800 crore rs 28 billion for 2006 07 ending the long and unfortunate period of revenue deficits that have adversely impacted the economic growth for the full decade 1994 2004
635268 by substantially increasing the plan outlays year after year we stepped up the public investment in an unprecedented manner which is responsible for leading the state to a double digit growth rate
635269 despite huge allocations for revenue expenditure like pensions scholarships rice subsidy power subsidy etc still attaining revenue surplus speaks volumes about this governments fiscal prudence and discipline in the management of resources

635339 we are very satisfied that after the successful deployment of astra 5a at 31 5 degrees east we have already been able to contract six transponders at this new orbital position the demand from customers for astra 5a shows how dynamic the market in central and eastern europe currently is we expect that this new orbital position serving these markets will further develop rapidly the broadband services from satgate will certainly represent a sound base to develop an attractive neighbourhood for additional customers on astra 5a not only for broadband but also in combination with direct to home tv services
635340 we are pleased to take our relationship with ses to a new stage based on its competencies and the high quality of service we trust the agreement for the use of four transponders on astra 5a will enable us to successfully expand our offers into the promising markets in eastern and central europe and the middle east we are looking forward to further develop our business and build on our strong relationship with ses
635341 reason would be impossible it would become a lunatic world with a population of lunatics
635342 we are worlds largest player in the nuclear power sector and to remain as number one firm we cannot afford to neglect india
635343 we are very active behind the scene areva will play a significant role in indian nuclear power sector
635344 if we enter into the nuclear power sector it will be done through a separate subsidiary we are waiting for the final guidelines from the indian government
635345 i feel the impact on the community is too great with a total closure
635346 i along with other council members are experiencing what its like to have a disability so thats why im conducting this meeting from a wheelchair
635347 to do a few wheelchair tours of the city to look for the best and worst examples of american disabilities act compliance
635348 it gets rid of blight and thats the bottom line
635349 but if we could purchase a dilapidated building quickly and get it sold demolished with a new house then there was a benefit
635350 were just hoping to get that old fashioned feel of a country fair
635351 this is the event we want to continue and make a tradition
635352 that was a big part of what we wanted to do
635353 our main goal was to have something in the area for local children and families that didnt cost an arm and a leg
635354 the lighting could be better our kitchen equipment is antiquated its just kind of improvements in general
635355 its just kind of trying to improve the things in the city that people love to come to
635356 the two local news channels were forcibly closed down by the authorities
635357 siege was also laid at offices of amar ujala and daink jagran the two hindi dailies
635358 it just seems like every change you make you just grow on it everything that you do opens you up to do other things
635359 march 20 to july 4 i didnt put any gas in my car
635360 i dont have any sense of the inconvenience of it
635361 doesnt allow me to multi task it seems to return you to a life of doing one thing at a time
635362 so were trying to kind of provide that for folks
635363 itll allow people to see what they can gradually do
635364 it seems like every year the size of the event has doubled
635365 the two local news channels were forcibly closed down by the authorities
635366 siege was also laid at offices of amar ujala and daink jagran the two hindi dailies
635367 whenever you have a money issue you get more voters to come out
635368 they want to be able to hop around but they cant split their ticket
635369 the removal of those positions should not have happened before the commission discussed and took a policy position on it
635370 the strain on the supervisors within the police department has exceeded the breaking point
635371 the wisdom of simply not filling positions as they become vacant i feel i would be doing a disservice to my membership and to the citizens of royal oak if i did not speak up there are simply not enough supervisors to effectively manage the police department
635372 until we get those reports and we see a working plan recommended by administration i dont see weve got any reason to make any kind of an adjustment regardless of what the personal feelings are of a couple employees if the grass is greener someplace else dont let the door hit you in the ass on the way out
635373 manage what i have as effectively and efficiently as i can and that means moving some things around
635374 it happened purely by accident in the first instance we were monitoring leopards in germany to try and understand their territorial patterns of hunting and mating when one of our team johan yo han noticed something quite peculiar when he was looking through some photos of leopards in our purpose built hide he returned to the teams very comfortable dormitory rather excited and animated and proclaimed to us that the leopards seemed unable to change their spots
635375 that right away we did not take johans wild claims very seriously so we tied him naked to the roof of the adjoining refrigeration plant we had however been drinking quite heavily but in the morning we realised he really was on to something and we began to throw ideas around which is when we came up with the idea of testing johans very same theory with humans
635376 it was then that it became clear to us that johan had been on to something
635377 regrettably it was four days before we were sober up enough to remember the whole tying onto the roof naked thing
635378 we were pretty lucky with the wind but it does look like it has shut down for the night we didnt stop during the race at all which was great especially when the breeze did die right off
635379 as expected black jack is a pedigree yacht and we are really happy with her performance and that of the crew we gelled together with the senior guys encouraging the younger crew to get involved
635380 this was our first race and already the crew is improving we are a great team who just want to go sailing id give this performance 7 5 out of ten
635381 there are certain things that have to happen and everybody kind of knows what they are if youve done it for a while
635382 how do you reinvent yourself which every organization has to do on a regular basis
635383 the high peaks dental team of three dentists cared for close to 200 patients in three hours on saturday for free
635384 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
635385 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
635386 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
635387 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
635388 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
635389 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
635390 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
635391 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
635392 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
635393 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
635394 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
635395 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
635396 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
635397 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
635398 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
635399 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
635400 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
635401 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
635402 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
635403 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
635404 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
635405 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
635406 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
635407 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
635408 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
635409 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
635410 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
635411 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
635412 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
635413 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
635414 assembling to march and protest is a citizens right but it must be stressed that when exercising this right citizens must respect and not harm others freedoms and rights and must not harm national social and collective interests
635415 to do something that has a big budget a great scope with a great director and great actors that has the quality and level of writing and the level of production design is a once in a lifetime opportunity
635416 any actor in his right mind would want to do this film would die to do it
635417 i would really come back for the people the thai people seem to be incredibly generous warm kind of loving people so its very nice to be around them the crews are magnificent and everybody ive met in my brief time off has been lovely
635418 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
635419 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
635420 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
635421 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
635422 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
635423 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
635424 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
635425 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
635426 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
635427 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
635428 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
635429 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
635430 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
635431 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
635432 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
635433 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
635434 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
635435 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
635436 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
635437 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
635438 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
635439 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
635440 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
635441 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
635442 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
635443 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
635444 five devotees were killed in the stampede which took place after a railing on the way to the temple collapsed
635445 we will wait for the norths sincere steps over a fact finding investigation with patience
635446 i could not count the dead i just glanced at once and i ran away for my life
635447 the worst thing i have seen was an old woman who lost two legs and a hand she was bleeding and later died before our eyes but we could do nothing as we ourselves needed help
635448 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
635449 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
635450 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
635451 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
635452 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
635453 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
635454 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
635455 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
635456 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

635472 it is a very different experience being here at a fair
635473 if you are fluent in english in brazil you have a better chance of getting a good job
635474 its challenging but it is necessary for us to learn it as well
635475 we have never had elephant ears before but from what we have been told it is quite tasty
635476 we are told that you can bet on the horse to win and if you pick the right horse you win lots of money
635477 our first concern is the safety of the people and the animals
635478 next week is going to be a very hot week for us
635479 it was first proposed 12 years ago under mayor margaret plantons administration
635480 theres a lot to talk about since it was first proposed in the 1990s the cost of the project has tripled
635481 so i think its important to look at the whole picture where it started and where we are now
635482 when it comes down to it we have to say were finally here do we lose 2 2 million in funding because were unwilling to borrow 1 4
635483 ou form an attachment to them you build up their trust and then you have to sell them
635484 you have to have a horse trailer because there is no way you can lift a big pig
635485 i have spent a lot of time working and practicing with my steer
635486 ive been in this business 25 years and ive never seen price increases like this year over year
635487 its still our goal to have healthier options in schools but we realize there are issues with that
635488 i want to keep getting fresh fruits and vegetables on the plate its a priority
635489 the whole concept is to try to capture children who qualify but may not apply
635490 it will be wait and see i dont expect it to help increase revenue but it might
635491 this next school year is going to be a scary time because prices are going up
635492 a food cooperative is getting the best bang for commodity dollars
635493 i dont like raw foods coming into my building because its too scary
635494 i can spend all of my commodity dollars and then some and get more of what i want and get rid of things that dont go so well with my kids
635495 if there is a downside sometimes when i order if my distribution center is out of green beans for example then i have to turn my sheet over and order them from government food services
635496 we need to plan for the future with a common sense and balanced approach to our energy crisis
635497 part of that is exploring and producing energy right here at home
635498 we also need to support the continued development of alternative and renewable sources of energy and to increase conservation in the meantime lifting the congressional ban on oil and natural gas exploration in outer continental shelf waters between florida and cuba will send a message to the rest of the world that america is serious about becoming energy independent
635499 not all the time its a sure thing but usually if a horse has a good record then he is a good racer

635510 many people are trying to save money when grocery shopping and we are seeing an increase in sales by them shopping with us
635511 over the years retailers realized that store brands were not just something to be floated out during hard times
635512 all of us are creatures of habit and when things are going well you just buy what you bought last week
635513 customers are much more willing to try a corporate brand when the economy gets tough and when we can get the customer to try it they like it it just makes it so much easier for us to get the customer to try it
635514 just because its a store brand doesnt mean its not the best for your family
635515 got up later than i wanted and now i have to rush
635516 its very exciting i think everyone is relaxed and in good spirits and certainly looking forward to getting in the water in the next few days

635520 its impact on price is quite small we only expect a modest rise a few per cent because its capital expenditure over 40 years
635521 our prices are only about one third of the delivered price where we expect the increases to be is in the actual cost of the energy the generation with gas prices going up with the carbon pricing and the 20 per cent renewables
635522 our existing network was built to handle the quarter acre block with a house and three power points and four globes but suddenly theyre being knocked down and replaced with six units with sophisticated electrical requirements
635523 and the network and transformers arent up to delivering the requirements of the more dense populations

635525 seven detained bahai believers have confessed to setting up an illegal organization in iran that took orders from israel and others to undermine the islamic system the iranian newspaper resalat said sunday
635526 seven bahai individuals have set up an illegal organization with connections to a number of countries including israel and they have received orders from them to undertake measures against the islamic system
635527 this fact led to the arrest of seven individuals they have all confessed to the formation of an illegal organization including having ties with israel

635548 i hate talking about my age because its just a number at the end of the day im looking forward to playing in the premier league and if people start writing me off they are badly mistaken

635616 i hate it when people say theyve got secrets you might as well tell me now
635617 when we are born the cord that secures the light is rather like strong elastic in and out you go wouldnt even notice youd left only when we sleep does the spirit wander off on longer journeys kept to the body by its extending reins then snap in goes that silver cord and youre back wide awake
635618 there are however certain conditions when its harder to return from journeys
635619 in extreme pain grief for instance then the light whooshes right out it hovers detached from the awfulness you must have heard the expression beside yourself thats how some people manage the unbearable they leave it
635620 this silver cord slackens and the light roams further on until frayed and eroded it loses its tenure and gives up the ghost
635621 of course there are special people who are born with an old spirit the elastic is loose and floppy even when theyre young the light spontaneously leaves the body and roams off its called floating but the spirit must be taught to behave cant just meander about like a curious child it would get into all sorts of trouble
635622 the person to whom it belongs or belonged there are of course becoming engrossed once more in the womans face mana saw it was like a mask
635623 the man upstairs who told you to draw the triangle you mean his influence was enough to make you do that so in some ways he was alive living on borrowed light do you want to share your spirit with anybody else
635624 its as if you follow me around without moving even from here you can see things you did tricks as well didnt you and that woman foddly she used to talk to ghosts maybe theyre coming back now i dont want to see them sonjia or my spirit go in and out im young and i dont want them coming to me stealing my soul
635625 the month is generally weak in the first half then stronger in the middle
635626 while the us european and japanese are contracting moderately the asian economy continues to experience growth that is near its potential and south american growth is just below potential
635627 recent data releases and reports suggest that the consumer will continue to be pressured on all fronts income or cash flow wealth and credit consumers can spend using any of these buckets however with the labor market continuing to weaken housing continuing to deteriorate and credit harder to come by the outlook for spending remains bleak despite recent declines in gasoline prices
635628 it is nearly certain the fed will leave the federal funds rate unchanged at the august 5 meeting the market expects a higher federal funds rate at the end of the year we do not the details of the gdp report point to significant weakness in the economy against this backdrop and financial market fragility the fed would only exacerbate the economic situation by raising the federal funds rate in haste fighting inflation will have to remain on the back burner until financial and economic conditions improve by that time inflation is likely to be moderating as it is a lagging economic process
635629 if it walks like a recession and talks like a recession it must be a recession is the fed going to raise its funds rate target over the remainder of 2008 not bloody likely
635630 former federal reserve chairman alan greenspan said the us is nowhere near the bottom of the housing slump and is right on the brink of a recession
635631 whitney says loosely transcribed fed knows there is no quick fix every time they open window they lose fire power for next crisis there is not much capital out there that wants to rescue brokers i keep saying we are less than 50 done with this crisis and are still there all capital raised by banks so far 450 billion was only to plug holes and not to grow business all banks assets marked at unrealistic levels creditors have cut mortgages and credit lines to the areas with the worst house prices depreciation that will hurt consumers even more corporate loan market will get hit soon as well maria was prodding to find out how quickly the stock prices were going back to the highs pump pump pump whitney says there is no way the bank stocks will return to the highs in next 3 years no comment on 5 years out the brokers are not growing capital and diluting the shareholder they cant grow earnings that way merrill raised tremendous amounts of capital just to plug holes they still have to shed assets and are not out of woods yet most every bank has to write down assets like merrill and raise capital banks who got in bed with housing assets such as c ubs mer bac wb will be in the market soon to do another capital raise everyone was involved in mortgages all of these banks are in trouble now 25 institutions will have to raise capital in next two months banks will cut dividends i dont understand why banks raise capital and then still pay a dividend it is not prudent for board members to keep paying when they are so capital restrained fannie freddie in same situation as every other institution all banks are betting on house price assumptions that are far too optimistic no banks are close to case shiller due to banks bad math losses will apply to everyone across the board in 2006 07 2 5 trillion was securitized nobody can replace this mortgage money and housing prices will continue to suffer as a result when maria asked if lehman will survive she said huh huh huh huh huh huh i dont know i am very opinionated on the short selling rule if you want to have faith in the capital market there has to be two sides to every trade and people have to be able to hedge restricting free trade will have the opposite effect and endanger the markets jamie dimon and goldman are pros and very cautious and aware of risks
635632 the us may now be in a very long recession that will drive the unemployment rate higher with little that the federal reserve can do to help said harvard university professor martin feldstein
635633 i dont see recovery on the horizon feldstein who headed the national bureau of economic research until june and serves on the groups recession dating panel said in an interview with bloomberg radio
635634 feldstein said the fed has already lowered interest rates as much as it can to help growth and that exports offer the only bright spot while they arent strong enough to fuel a recovery
635635 the next president should not be raising taxes feldstein said he said he was really surprised that obama hasnt backed off his proposals for a major tax increase
635636 feldstein said todays gross domestic product figures reinforced his view that the economy entered a recession in december or january gdp shrank at the end of 2007 and grew less than forecast in this years second quarter the commerce department reported today
635637 fed officials have lowered their benchmark rate to 2 from 5 25 since september bringing the reductions to a halt in june amid rising concern that inflation will accelerate feldstein indicated the central bank should refrain from lowering borrowing costs further
635638 real gross domestic product of the us economy grew at an annual rate of 1 9 in the second quarter following a revised 0 9 increase in the first quarter this report also contained revisions of gdp estimates going back to the first quarter of 2005
635639 real gdp grew at a slightly slower pace during the period of revision 2005 2007 the most noteworthy aspect was the contraction in real gdp growth in the fourth quarter of 2007 0 2 from an increase of 0 6 as per the previously published estimate
635640 in the second quarter consumer spending grew at an annual rate of 1
635641 exports of goods and services grew at an annual rate of 9
635642 total nonfarm payrolls fell by 51 000 in july the seventh consecutive monthly decline
635643 in the past 12 months private nonfarm payrolls have declined by a net 535 000 in the past 12 months the so called birth death adjustment has added a net 853 000 jobs
635644 the white house cut its forecast for us economic growth this year and indicated president george w bushs successor will face the dual headwinds of rising unemployment and faster inflation
635645 us gross domestic product will grow 1 6 this year and expand 2 2 in 2009 the white houses council of economic advisers said in a mid year review today the forecasts were slashed from an outlook in february for 2 7 growth this year and 3 for 2009
635646 the effects of the economic slump have worsened the job market and the white house forecast the jobless rate will average 5
635647 the us economy has continued to expand but growth has slowed as a result of the sharp housing decline disruptions in financial markets and high energy prices the report said
635648 the consumer price index will rise 3 8 this year compared with a february forecast for 2 7 the white house said next year the cost of living will increase 2 3 faster than the 2 1 gain predicted five months ago
635649 the white houses latest forecast for gdp growth was similar to private economists for this year and more optimistic for 2009 the economy will expand 1 6 in 2008 and grow 1 7 in 2009 according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by blue chip economic indicators this month
635650 the us treasury on monday said its borrowing would increase to 171 billion this quarter let us note three important points 1 budget deficits increase 50 to 100 in recessions 2 official budget deficit estimates historically greatly underestimate the deficits due to ridiculous assumptions and 3 surging nationalization and socialization is substantially increasing us guarantees and debt
635651 the credit squeeze in the us economy is likely to persist for many months and might even get worse gary stern president of the federal reserve bank of minneapolis has told the financial times
635652 he said that with interest rates at 2 the fed was well placed to cope with any negative surprises on growth by contrast he said it was not as well positioned to deal with any negative surprises on inflation
635653 even without any such surprises the minneapolis fed chief also said real interest rates were at levels that if sustained for too long would not be compatible with medium term price stability
635654 president george w bush signed into law legislation that helps 400 000 homeowners facing foreclosure and extends a lifeline to fannie mae and freddie mac
635655 bush signed the measure at the white house shortly after 7 a m spokesman tony fratto said treasury secretary henry paulson housing and urban development secretary steve preston and federal housing administration director brian montgomery were among those present
635656 we look forward to putting in place new authorities to improve confidence and stability in markets and to provide better oversight for fannie mae and freddie mac fratto said
635657 the law is aimed at stemming foreclosures and halting a free fall in housing prices by providing federal insurance for refinanced 30 year mortgages for homeowners struggling to make their monthly payments
635658 the measure also is designed to restore confidence in fannie mae and freddie mac by tightening regulations and authorizing the treasury secretary to inject capital into the two biggest u s providers of mortgage money
635659 banks have been given a one year reprieve by us accounting standard setters from having to take up to 5 000 billion of debt assets on to their balance sheets easing fears that they would be forced to raise large amounts of new capital quickly
635660 the financial accounting standards board voted to delay until january 2010 the introduction of rules that will force banks to consolidate more off balance sheet vehicles directly in their accounts
635661 robert herz fasb chairman said that the move was made reluctantly after a staff recommendation for a delay because there might not be enough time for all companies to adjust to the up heaval
635662 it does pain me to allow something that has been abused by certain folks to let that go on for another year he said
635663 recent data releases and reports suggest that the consumer will continue to be pressured on all fronts income or cash flow wealth and credit
635664 high inventories suggest still falling house prices putting further pressure on consumers balance sheets
635665 access to credit is likely to become harder to come by and more expensive
635666 consumer cash flows seem unlikely to improve anytime soon the labor market weakness evident in the claims figures suggest continued weakness in non farm payrolls
635667 data through may 2008 released today by standard amp poors for its s amp p case shiller1 home price indices the leading measure of us home prices show annual declines in the prices of existing single family homes across the united states generally continued to worsen in may 2008

635669 rising mortgage rates and mounting inventories warn that the us housing slump is far from over
635670 congress is trying to ease the burden on stretched homeowners and moved decisively to prevent a meltdown in the gses
635671 bond yields have risen in recent months pushed up by increasing inflation concerns and comments from some members of the fomc federal open mouth committee financial institutions are also belatedly widening spreads and tightening lending standards
635672 banks struggling to recover from multibillion dollar losses on real estate are curtailing loans to american businesses depriving even healthy companies of money for expansion and hiring
635673 two vital forms of credit used by companies commercial and industrial loans from banks and short term commercial paper not backed by collateral collectively dropped almost 3 over the last year to 3
635674 the scarcity of credit has intensified the strains on the economy by withholding capital from many companies just as joblessness grows and consumers pull back from spending in the face of high gas prices plummeting home values and mounting debt
635675 the second half of the year is shot said michael t
635676 companies that rely on credit are now delaying and canceling expansion plans as they struggle to secure finance
635677 merrill lynch is to raise an extra 8 5 billion in fresh capital on top of 23 5 billion already raised in the past 12 months as the beleaguered investment bank took some drastic steps to right its capital position
635678 merrill which just two weeks ago announced plans to raise almost 8 billion from asset sales including its 20 stake in financial news provider bloomberg revealed that it needs to raise the money after disclosing that it will take a financial hit of 10 6 billion in the third quarter
635679 the news will come as a surprise to the financial community which had hoped that the worse was over for merrill which has already been one of the largest victims to date of the continuing credit crisis
635680 prior to this latest series of writedowns and exceptional losses merrill has already written down 40 billion in assets and other instruments
635681 but chairman and chief executive john thain said that the news was positive because of the fact it has been able to off load the substantial majority of its positions in a certain type of complex debt vehicle
635682 mr thain who took over from stan oneal last december said the news marked a significant milestone in our risk reduction efforts
635683 leading global banks including citigroup and ubs on tuesday faced renewed pressure to write down or sell billions of dollars in toxic assets following merrill lynchs disposal of 30 billion in mortgage related securities at a cut price
635684 merrills move to sell collateralised debt obligations cdos for 6 7 billion or 22 cents on the dollar announced on monday night raised hopes that other banks would be able to strike similar deals and purge their balance sheets of bad assets
635685 however the low price paid by lone star funds a distressed debt investor to buy merrills cdos sparked fears that the financial system could enter another spiral of huge writedowns followed by highly dilutive capital raisings
635686 merrill on tuesday raised 8 5 billion to offset 5 7 billion of writedowns caused by the cdo sales and other losses by selling shares at 22 50 a 7 5 discount to mondays close
635687 mike mayo deutsche bank analyst said merrills action a fortnight after john thain chief executive said that it did not need more capital raises ongoing credibility issues for the industry
635688 developed market bond yields should move markedly higher through the rest of this summer but then fall sharply going into 2009 says daniel pfaendler head of g10 economics amp strategy at dresdner kleinwort
635689 he believes the oil price shock and the unwinding of asset bubbles over leverage and economic imbalances in general should keep growth significantly below trend and real yields depressed for a protracted period of time
635690 price stability oriented central banks having learned their lessons from the 1970s should become more hawkish in the near term thereby limiting the upward pressure on long run inflation expectations mr pfaendler says
635691 however he believes inflation will peak around autumn and then fall significantly into 2009
635692 he adds that the positive growth effects of us tax rebates should dissipate raising the risk of a simultaneous recession in the us the eurozone and the uk during winter
635693 therefore real yields and inflation expectations should be able to fall in tandem making long duration as well as curve steepening exposure across developed bond markets attractive again
635694 do you remember treasury secretary paulson rushing all over the world beijing moscow berlin tokyo you name it
635695 the dollar on a purchasing power parity is ridiculously cheap now
635696 in my opinion that was the deal that was the reason why paulson was running all over the world with his secret message
635697 faced with a swelling federal budget deficit as a slowing economy saps tax revenues the us treasury is expected to boost the frequency of 10 year note sales and offer more 30 year bonds next month
635698 analysts estimate the treasury will announce plans to sell 15 billion to 16 billion in 10 year notes and 9 billion to 10 billion in long bonds at its refunding announcement on wednesday
635699 theres a realization that these higher deficits are going to be with us for a while because the outlook for growth in the second half and into next year has deteriorated said lou crandall chief economist at wrightson icap in jersey city new jersey
635700 could we be watching a vicious but erratic correction in an ongoing bull market as far as im concerned this is the multi trillion dollar question of the day and the month and the year because if this is a correction rather than a primary bear market then this market could tend to hold and this market could be building a base and if so then 18 billion shorts will begin to get squeezed and if this market is in the process of building a base then the big money will begin slowly and subtly to re enter the market
635701 fullermoney has been very cautious regarding western banks for a number of months not least because of the weak performance and obvious fundamental problems
635702 i would now describe my view as cautiously bullish which requires some explanation
635703 taking a longer term view i would not be surprised to see a signification consolidation within the western banking industry over the next few years this will inevitably favour the strong players meanwhile conservative investors may prefer bank bonds to equity
635704 looking at the charts action for bank indices such as s amp p 500 regional banks dj euro banks and ftse 350 banks we certainly had climactic action in mid july as pointed out at the time
635705 while these bank indices have eased in the last three days after encountering overhead resistance evident from the january march range lows they have retained more of the recent rally than broader indices in the usa continental europe and the uk this may have something to do with the recent investigations regarding shorting but it could also indicate that the banks themselves are less bearish of their sector from a bullish perspective it would be encouraging if bank indices maintained their recent relative strength and also held at least half of this months gains
635706 the outperformance of japanese stocks over the past few months looks set to continue believes paul danis equity strategist at lehman brothers
635707 after strongly underperforming from early 2006 to march this year japan has outperformed the global equity market by 14 in dollar terms and 24 in local currency terms since mid march he says we think that the rally has legs
635708 mr danis notes that the total cash yield in japan has bucked the global trend and kept rising as net stock buybacks have increased in contrast to the us and uk
635709 mr danis also says that while the economic backdrop in japan is far from great he expects growth to be strong relative to the rest of the world some key japanese economic indicators are showing resilience and there are continued signs that japans economy is exiting a deflationary period
635710 he adds that analysts have aggressively marked down japanese company earnings expectations while for the world ex japan composite earnings are still at peak levels there is scope for this gap to close which should benefit japanese stocks relative to global markets in aggregate
635711 we recommend investors with a global mandate overweight japan in equity dedicated portfolios
635712 the three major currencies of central europe have appreciated strongly against the euro so far this year boosted to varying degrees by rising interest rates strong economic growth and positive investor sentiment the latter buoyed by the final confirmation that slovakia will adopt the euro next january
635713 zimbabwes economy is unravelling at such a pace that the central bank is set to slash yet more zeroes from the countrys increasingly worthless currency
635714 state media on sunday quoted gideon gono the reserve bank of zimbabwe governor and one of the members of the ruling elite targeted by fresh western sanctions last week as saying he would extend a currency policy that has so far failed to stem hyperinflation
635715 this time we will make sure that those zeroes that would come knocking on the governors window will not return mr gono was quoted as saying on saturday in a speech to farmers
635716 independent estimates put zimbabwes inflation rate well above the official 2 2 million per cent prompting the introduction last week of a 100 billion zimbabwean dollar note even state media reported mr gonos comments drew laughter from his audience
635717 the governor is expected to chop three or six zeroes from the currency following a three zero cut in 2006
635718 beside the inflationary zeroes haunting mr gono analysts and some opposition politicians say the crumbling economy in what was once a regional bread basket is perhaps the single greatest factor that might force robert mugabe president into relaxing his grip on power
635719 the government blames the economic strife on illegal sanctions condemning opponents who point to violence land seizures that have contributed to a drastic fall in agricultural output
635720 global growth is downshifting and the cyclical economic backdrop is no longer supportive of further commodity price gains

635769 im bitterly disappointed i feel like we really dominated todays race i made an error down pit lane i just couldnt see the pit exit and we sped i went down and had a look at it and its still hard to see im just really disappointed i feel like the race was ours today and i tripped over myself im real sorry for my team and stp and jtg daugherty racing for i let them down i guess its a shame
635770 it was it tricky for the first time for these guys to have a race in the rain we actually got a race in that was a good thing it felt really slow and the car was slipping around getting up to speed there when we first put the wets on i thought im real trouble here because ive just got no grip obviously i had no grip better than everyone else because we did pretty well it was treacherous it was tricky but i think all the drivers kept of the race track for the most part and we got a race in which is important i think to nascars credit for not running rain races very often that they did a pretty good job
635771 we had a great day going i just sped down pit lane actually i took off too early i couldnt see the end of pit lane i just couldnt see it the line on the race track i couldnt see it i couldnt see the cone i waited until i got passed pruett and counted to three and took off and i must have just jumped the line but 20 or 30 feet im bitterly disappointed that i let everybody down with that i feel robbed about it to be honest with you i feel like we just dominated today we controlled the race from the front its just a real shame for stp and jtg daugherty racing weve got great things on the horizon but i just feel a little jinxed i feel like i need to win a race ive come here twice dominated and came up short both times so im gonna have to have a few beers or something to reconcile myself tonight and hopefully ill wake up tomorrow with a hangover and feel a little better right now i feel very disappointed and hopefully that goes away
635772 if the race kept going or the rain had stopped they couldnt keep the race going it was too wet i commend nascar for making the call to stop that race because it was getting dangerous out there we had a lot of car whether patrick carpentier and the 5 ron fellows had to stop one more time if they didnt we would race them hard to the end we still feel like were in a good position but i really let them down i guess i could be mad at nascar but im not im mad at myself for making a mistake its hard to see that cone i guess a lot of guys got penalized for doing the same thing but its just the way it goes
635773 ive learned that i dont want to race in the rain in a nascar again its really tricky maybe if there is inclement weather again down the road nascar wont be so frightened to put us out there on wets because we got a race in everyone was safe and it was a decent show i guess the tires held up and the cars held up i thought for sure we were going to have electrical problems with all the water that was coming in the car but anything that got wet was me
635774 i feel jinxed full stop ive come along way to be part of nascar and im two and a half years into this deal and havent gotten a victory ive got second third fourth fifth whatever but that win has alluded me i guess if you keep knocking on the door it will come i feel comfortable out there i feel like i belong i feel like if we keep at it the win will fall our way but right now its a bitter pill to swallow i havent had this good a race and not won twice in a row before at a track its usual this place has been great to me were going to come back next year im sure and try and break that win then well be off but who knows im disappointed but life goes on ive got two health girls back home im looking forward to getting home and seeing those girls tonight and play in the sandbox tomorrow and have a swim and forget about life
635775 i think its okay we demonstrated today that we can get a race in and the tires are decent and the cars run maybe some of those cup guys dont want to run in the rain who knows id be happy to run a cup car in the rain not problem
635776 we obviously had the best car for these track conditions that was really pleasing this was my first experience in the rain ever the car was pretty good everything was going really well then we pitted and got that penalty but really at that point we had such a lead we were so far ahead of most of the field it really wasnt going to hurt us that bad in the end we were in position to be leading again once everybody pitted obviously the race got called short im not sure the how sound the thought process was between at what point in time is it raceable or not raceable thats all new to nascar its new to everybody but at least in our case its pretty unfortunate the way those decisions went down and we ended up finishing third instead of winning
635777 i feel like montreal owes us yeah weve been in position to win and had the best car twice and couldnt close the deal theres always next year
635778 im pretty happy we didnt have a mark on our car we finished fifth we made a mistake and the rules are so new and we thought nascar was going to let us decide when to put dries on so we gambled on it drying out so we put a full dry set up on so we werent set up best for the rain but all in all it was a good day and the car was great i had a blast
635779 yeah its my kind of racing but you really need to be set up right and the tires as old as they are theyre a little hard so was zero grip out there all in all im surprised how well everyone did and how few accidents there were in the end people were wrecking under caution because you just couldnt see the cars were hydroplaning all in all it was a great day except we didnt win
635780 racing in the rain was a lot of fun im glad we didnt wreck im proud of my guys they did a good job having the car ready for the rain i just wished it wouldnt have started raining so hard and we could have raced a little longer i think we maybe would have been a tick better but that was good
635781 i kind of was looking forward to this because ive never raced in the rain but i dont think i will be from now on it was a lot of fun it got a little hairy there when it started raining so hard the car would hydroplane bad down the frontstretch and i mean a 140 or 150 miles an hour hydroplane is not very safe it made it hard to see there at the end it was raining so hard and everything was getting so wet the guys said there was an inch of water in the right side of the car laying on the floorboard in the car so the car started to fill with water and we were going to start having electrical problems well not us but probably everybody soon but it was fun it was a lot of fun im glad i made history today the first time we raced in the rain
635782 it was interesting certainly i dont have road course racing figured out on dry tracks must less wet tracks it was a learning experience i went as hard as i could that i knew 100 percent that i wouldnt run off course and i think that was our saving grace we werent fast by any means but we were pretty smart conservative on the pit stops and everything else we just did the best we could with what we had to work with it was a learning experience nascar did what they had to do to get this race in i credit them for trying we all learned a little bit and the next time we race in the rain it will probably go a lot easier
635783 all you can do is smile because in my opinion it was a pointless race we were running seventh when it was dry we had a great car an easy top 10 then it started raining and we were running in the top 15 then all of a sudden it just down poured and you cant quite literally see in front of you when i was going down the straightaway i had to get next to the wall and the only part that i could see i could barely see the wall i had to look at the wall and follow it down the straightaway it wasnt safe its sad that that happened the scott towels ford fusion was really fast we had an easy top 10 in the dry

635908 for how come you burn them leafs under my window you
635909 while i was driving your truck me somebody pass a nail under the wheel and give it a big flat
635910 he must have stabbed him 50 times or 60 times
635911 while we were watching he calmly walked up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stared at us and dropped the head right in front of us
635912 i dont think the guy knew him at all the poor guy he didnt see it coming
635913 by the time the police arrived the driver and the remaining passengers had all safely exited the bus
635914 at 1 28 a m the suspect attempted to jump out of the bus after breaking a window he was immediately subdued and arrested without incident and is currently in rcmp custody
635915 he didnt do anything to provoke the guy the guy just took a knife out and stabbed him started stabbing him like crazy and cut his head off
635916 some people were puking some people were crying other people were in shock everybody was running screaming off the bus
635917 he walks up to the door holds the head in the door just looks at them crazy like and drops the head and walks back to the body and starts cutting more
635918 we were telling him stay put stay put stay there dont try to come out he tried to get the bus working and the bus driver disabled the bus somehow in the back im not sure how he did it and at that point i think the police showed up
635919 there was no rage or anything he was like a robot stabbing the guy
635920 when we saw the head we knew he was dead
635921 i dont think the guy knew him at all i think he was really crazy the poor guy he didnt see it coming
635922 the first thing i heard was something like a terrible type of yowl and that was from the guy who got stabbed
635923 my daughter said oh my god and everybody else started screaming

635927 our drivers are trained to provide the safest travel for all our passengers and every time an incident occurs they know to pull the bus over and call 911
635928 we are going to do whatever we need to provide the passengers with counselling or any other measures to make sure theyre taken care of

635938 i realize that all of this must be very hard to process and most traumatic with the death of your friend
635939 ah i assume that was your friend you were with
635940 my name is matthew bartholomew recker the man that attacked you just now was named peerce sadly he was once a good friend of mine it pained me to kill him but im afraid hed chosen a path i couldnt agree with
635941 he wasnt trying to kill both of you just you um whats your name
635942 youve been through a lot soon youll go through a lot more i hate being the one to put you through it i think it might be best if you let things settle in your mind a bit before we continue
635943 good now unless you want to stay out here all night i suggest you come with me to my car the walk should give you time to think
635944 ill go back to the first one why was peerce why was peerce trying to kill me
635945 ironically enough you should have started with how did you do that thing with the rails or what are you or better yet what am i though i doubt youve come to question that yet what with everything else youve had to take in tonight
635946 what we are is hard to sum up in one word the one weve chosen from the english language is deity it suits us well enough we are immortals who once held sway over existence itself bending reality on a whim weve lost our strength over the years and now we live in the shadows doing our best to coexist with mortals that little guard rail trick took more of a tole on me than was visible and im not going to be doing anything that big again for at least an hour
635947 i suppose coming back to your question youd first have to know about our power imagine that theres a well where all our power came from and when the first deities were born all of its contents were divided among them but new deities were still being born and in order for them to survive they needed a little amount of that same power so every deity on the planet lost a small fraction of this supernatural strength until they were once again equal does that make sense
635948 so naturally every time a new deity is born we all get a little weaker now a deitys individual strength depends not on how much of this power he has but how good he is at using it a young deity spends a great deal more on certain tasks than an older more experienced one would but as the centuries passed our power declined more and more until certain deities felt that in order to keep our strength it was necessary to kill newer deities that didnt have the mastery of the older ones peerce was a member of a group called the purifiers who felt it was their duty to preserve that strength and thats why he attacked you
635949 does this mean i can do all the things you can
635950 someday maybe you might live long enough to see our power fade unless the babykillers have their way the day will come when our power is spread so thin itll be like we dont have any at all
635951 its never constant but the most weve ever had was twelve in one decade that was considered a baby boom for us this century weve been lucky to get two every ten years but the babykillers usually get to them pretty quickly we can sense a birth by a sudden drop in our strength
635952 yeah we call them that because to most of us even a full grown man is a baby by comparison
635953 we can sense the loss of power but the power itself is dormant in new deities they live like mortals vulnerable and powerless until their awakening
635954 peerce wouldnt have found you if you hadnt didnt you have a really weird dream recently and woke up with a headache
635955 that headache was the feeling of your mind expanding it has to in order for it to remember the thousands of years youre now capable of living though if you live long enough you wont remember
635956 sometimes an awakening can happen early if the deity in question is put in a situation where a mortal would die their immortality kicks in to save them but its unbelievably painful and like a premature baby theyre at a serious disadvantage with future progression of their abilities not to mention theyll be frozen at that young age forever
635957 ah you already have i feel kinda sorry for you when the awakening occurs is another inconsistency i stopped at around twenty eight if i remember correctly but ive known some deities that make it to their late fifties before awakening provided theyre never forced into it by external threats
635958 it feels like i dont miss my friend as much as i know i should right now do deities not feel emotional pain once they mature or something
635959 this period of time may be tough on you as part of your development youll start to care less and less about the world around you for most deities this apathetic period commonly called the relinquish lasts for several days or a month maybe its intended to make it easier to see everything you once found dear and familiar change or fade of course how you feel once its over is up to you youre only forced through a month to begin with but once you regain control of your own emotions you might begin to feel just like you did before you awakened or you may continue to feel no attachment its hard to say which is the better life
635960 one deity can kill another about as easily as one mortal kills another normally things like swords and bullets wont penetrate our skin but when one of us uses it we subconsciously charge it with the tiniest bit of our own power all it takes is that little amount to make the weapon break our natural defenses though a strong deity can throw up shields of energy if he wants thats not very easy though
635961 well no i guess whoever created us wanted there to be a way for mortals to kill us if they had to you see each of us has an animal that is connected to us in a well i guess a spiritual kind of way your spirit animal is very close to you and youll feel a connection when youre close to one of its kind if blood from your spirit animal ever touches your skin youll temporarily lose your invulnerability and your head will become very clouded which isnt to say youre doomed if that ever happens ive know a few people whove fought splendidly drenched in the blood of their spirit animals but its just very difficult you see
635962 no you should it was revealed to you in your dream
635963 it couldnt really hurt not to know it youll recognize the feeling if you ever get near one its been a while since anyone has even tried to use that against one of us anyway
635964 a dog well certain dogs when i was born certain breeds hadnt come into existence yet and the genetics of some dogs are too clouded for me to relate to them at all
635965 you said youd wake me up when we got here
635966 of course why not ive been around long enough to know good music when i hear it and those guys were good why not a fan
635967 not really i mean i like them but theyre not on the top of my list its just weird to meet a guy centuries old who likes music from my parents lifetime
635968 i dont really listen to music that much i guess i like that acoustic rock mixed with techno stuff i dont really know what you call it
635969 i thought you said this relinquish thing would make me emotionless for a few days i still feel a lot of emotions
635970 just less concerned with things that used to be important to you its a sort of severing of ties that clears your system of all the things you once held dear so you can run headlong into eternity free of prior devotions any ties you make later are a different story but for the relinquish to be effective we have to keep you away from everything that made up your previous life including your family believe me its easier if you just forget them for now
635971 how dare you try to take my life away from me
635972 which brings me to another point today a friend of mine will be falsifying some records to blink you back into existence as someone new you cant be martin anymore youve got to pick a new name what name would you like
635973 dont pick one youll get too attached to youll have to pick a new one in a few years to avoid suspicion
635974 dont strain yourself youve got some time to decide for now why dont you just take a shower and get ready for the day i picked up a few basic toiletries for you and left them on the bathroom sink and you can borrow my clothes im a little taller than you so they might be a bit big but theyll do until we can go shopping for real later
635975 youll just have to lay low until people stop looking for you
635976 wouldnt it have been easier to leave the wreckage from the car put peerces body in it and burn it beyond recognition and then just fix that tree you damaged then let everyone think tyler and i died in the crash
635977 while you were showering i took a look at the old place and thought it could use some sprucing didnt think youd want to live like me for too long
635978 you really didnt have to put yourself through this for me

635994 that said people remember negative ads candidates use them because they are effective
635995 if they can capitalize on pre existing fears the electorate has about obama or hesitations they have about him it can be an effective strategy
635996 washington is full of talented talkers and senator obama is one of the best to come along in quite a while unfortunately on issues big and small what he says and what he does are often two different things

636056 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
636057 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
636058 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
636059 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
636060 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
636061 believe that coupling an investment in alternative fuels with increased domestic production of oil is preferable to alternative fuel investment combined with energy conservation alone
636062 the only way to break free from the burden of rising gasoline prices and electricity rates is to get free
636063 bid up the price of every last drop of oil and every last lump of coal
636064 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
636065 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
636066 by 1985 enough millions will have died to reduce the earths population to some acceptable level like 1 5 billion people
636067 we have to offer up scary scenarios make simplified dramatic statements and make little mention of any doubts we may have each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest
636068 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
636069 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
636070 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
636071 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
636072 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
636073 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
636074 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
636075 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
636076 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
636077 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
636078 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
636079 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
636080 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
636081 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
636082 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
636083 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
636084 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
636085 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
636086 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
636087 mr gore proposed dramatically improving our national electricity grid and energy efficiency while investing massively in clean solar wind geothermal and carbon sequestered coal technologies that we know can work but just need to scale
636088 were building up co2 so rapidly that were seeing the consequences scientists have long predicted
636089 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
636090 what if we could use fuels that are not expensive dont cause pollution and are abundantly available right here at home we have such fuels scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of us electricity demand geothermal energy similarly is capable of providing enormous supplies of electricity for america the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses today i challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
636091 mountaintop mining is an atrocity its part and parcel of the energy system thats causing global warming and the same moral blindness
636092 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
636093 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on but overall i mean ive always been a supporter of nuclear power and he has not agreed with that
636094 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
636095 john mccain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming five years ago
636096 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
636097 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
636098 let me just say again sen obama no storage and no reprocess and thats nuclear power no drilling offshore thats a way of finding oil and gas reserves dr no
636099 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
636100 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
636101 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
636102 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
636103 in this camp we learn the important things of life good behavior respect
636104 kill zionists wherever they are in the name of god
636105 were going to take down seven countries in five years
636106 were going to start with iraq then syria lebanon then libya somalia sudan and were going to come back and get iran in five years
636107 my friends i ask you how could we in this country with all it stands for democracy freedom human rights respect for the individual a belief if the worth of every person how could we have done this and believe we wouldnt pay the price
636108 gore s talking about electricity generation and what hes really substituting out is one of our most abundant resources that makes us energy independent and thats coal
636109 and if oil can be obtained from our own domestic locations either the outer continental shelf or anwr or oil shale in utah and the rockies and it can be done without environmental harm now not 100 percent guarantee of no environmental harm but reasonable kinds of risks of environmental harms that would not be catastrophic then why wouldnt we why wouldnt we do that
636110 we need to explore all avenues that we can for energy many factors should be taken into consideration it has to be safe cost effective and timely we cannot be limited in our thinking
636111 did democrat mary landrieu not read the gore memo she now 21 years later for the purposes of reelection wants drilling in the gulf she and democrats have oppposed it for 21 years vote em out and join drill now drill here polar bears eat the baby seals democrats protect how stupid of democrats to save everything and lose their own souls respectfully john mcintyre
636112 how soon we forget old gore has lost it take a look at his scare brain ideas he tried to legislate when vp population control acid rain etc and now his global warming placing the blame on we the people have you read the scientific reports who disagree its costing us billions amp we the people are paying for his errors
636113 i think coal is a very good partial solution to our energy needs there is coal for hundreds of years there is also a system close to final stages of development that will use electron technology to remove toxic pollutants so2 and nox as well as particulants this system is near production just a couple of miles from congress at escrub in alexandria va add this to wind solar hydrogen nuclear and domestic oil and we would have a smooth steady and possible transition to the future sources that are not available now
636114 how thankful i am that god did not allow gore to be elected to an office
636115 dr chiltons ideas are practical and need to be implemented without further delay
636116 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
636117 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
636118 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
636119 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
636120 the way to bring gas prices down is to end our dependence on oil and use the renewable sources that can give us the equivalent of 1 a gallon gasoline
636121 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
636122 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
636123 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
636124 once again we have an opportunity to take a giant leap for humankind
636125 when we send money to foreign countries to buy nearly 70 percent of the oil we use every day they build new skyscrapers and we lose jobs when we spend that money building solar arrays and windmills we build competitive industries and gain jobs here at home
636126 i have long supported a sharp reduction in payroll taxes with the difference made up in co2 taxes we should tax what we burn not what we earn this is the single most important policy change we can make
636127 we must recognize those who have toiled in dangerous conditions to bring us our present energy supply we should guarantee good jobs in the fresh air and sunshine for any coal miner displaced by impacts on the coal industry
636128 in recent years our politics has tended toward incremental proposals made up of small policies designed to avoid offending special interests alternating with occasional baby steps in the right direction our democracy has become sclerotic at a time when these crises require boldness
636129 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
636130 more than any time in history mankind faces a crossroads one path leads to despair and utter hopelessness the other to total extinction let us pray that we have the wisdom to choose correctly
636131 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
636132 says he has all the answers and it will only cost 3 trillion
636133 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
636134 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
636135 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
636136 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
636137 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
636138 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
636139 gore new yorker cover way too far over the top
636140 after an exhaustive review of a substantial body of climate research and in conjunction with the obvious and compelling new evidence that exists it is time that the world community acknowledges that the earth has begun its next climate change in an opinion echoed by many scientists around the world the space and science research center ssrc today declares that the worlds climate warming of the past decades has now come to an end a new climate era has already started that is bringing predominantly colder global temperatures for many years into the future in some years this new climate will create dangerously cold weather with significant ill effects world wide global warming is over a new cold climate has begun
636141 as a dissenting physicist i simply can no longer buy the notion that co2 produces any significant warming of the atmosphere at any rate
636142 on a global basis sea ice anomalies in may 2008 continue to be above the long term average during the 1979 2008 satellite period the 10th highest on record
636143 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
636144 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
636145 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
636146 is that the right kind of signal to send to the young people of this country who more than any time in recent memory are deeply involved in the political decisions that were making this year and young people who want to get into the political arena look to al gore and he said its all about trivia and nonsense
636147 the new internet based forms of organizing and mobilizing people
636148 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
636149 both are serious and must be addressed that having been said i think that the climate crisis is by far the most serious threat we have ever faced
636150 well ive endorsed barack obama im a democrat but i think that john mccain deserves credit for having provided some leadership in the republican party years ago at a time when it was needed
636151 youre looking at a different list than i am ive decided to impose a personal term limit of two terms as vice president
636152 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
636153 this is where terrorists can plan attacks they have sanctuary here they are gathering huge amounts of money as a consequence of the opium drug trade in the region
636154 i would look to be able to make recommendations to president bush in the fall to continue those reductions
636155 certainly there are assumptions which you could make which would make that possible
636156 i dont think theres any doubt that we were distracted from our efforts not only to hunt down al qaeda and the taliban but also to rebuild this country
636157 the interesting thing is that the people who are very experienced in foreign affairs i dont think have those doubts
636158 the troops that ive been meeting with over the last several days they dont seem to have those doubts
636159 im not yet able to put an exact time line on it per se
636160 i think the strategic goals of having time horizons are ones that we all seek because eventually we would like to see u s forces draw down and eventually all come home
636161 the day is coming when american forces will step back more and more from combat roles the day is coming when will be doing more in the way of training and less in the way of fighting those goals are being achieved now
636162 senator mccain and i and others want us out of iraq sooner rather than later
636163 but we want us out in a way that does not compromise all the gains that american and iraqi forces have made in iraq w e want to stay there to a victory because we dont want all those who have served in the american uniform there to have served or in some cases died in vain
636164 i think its important to note that barack obamas judgment about these issues has been excellent from the beginning the kind of judgment youd want in a commander in chief and others are now beginning to adopt his positions
636165 we wouldnt be discussing surges in iraq or anything else if barack had had his way we wouldnt have started that war to begin with
636166 thats not the sort of thing you say no to
636167 if john asks me and he thinks i can help him
636168 we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
636169 this climate crisis is threatening our country threatening all of human civilization
636170 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
636171 the devastating effect on main street and the rest of the country is coming from the present cost of electricity
636172 the price increases are likely to continue until we stop just taking baby steps
636173 the focus now is past president bush toward whats going to happen in january
636174 i disagreed with those who wanted a so called gas tax holiday
636175 the people of this country are ready for bolder more dramatic actions
636176 im under no illusion that theres any position with as much influence as that of president and in fact i tried to get that position but that didnt happen
636177 but i personally feel that my own best role is to try to bring about a sea change in public opinion
636178 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
636179 okay weve got it from here you can leave now
636180 when two elephants fight its the grass that suffers the most
636181 remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
636182 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to conduct targeted counter terrorism missions against al qaeda in iraq and to protect american diplomatic and civilian personnel
636183 as an active member of the armed forces i believe that admiral michael mullen should refrain from political speeches and campaigning its the law and its a good one i am tired of having our servicemen and women used as political footballs if mullen wants to enter the campaign then he can retire and comment to his hearts content
636184 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
636185 even those who back aggressive steps to combat climate change viewed the proposal with some skepticism they said the proposal was impractical and far too costly
636186 the nations senior military official warned against a plan to remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
636187 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
636188 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
636189 who wants to exit in a quicker way has a better assessment of the situation in iraq
636190 if we dont get our way we will bomb you
636191 i want this job done in 18 months now tell me how you are going to do it
636192 there is no mountain over which you can see the future
636193 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
636194 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
636195 so anyways this is als crowd because of course he invented the internet
636196 our favorite question if meat causes more carbon emissions than cars what should we do
636197 its outright pathetic to see so many comments attacking the messenger rather than debating the ideas
636198 those ads really were focused on two things they were focused on the fact that sen obama wants to raise taxes and im opposed of it and he opposes an energy policy which would work including offshore drilling so the message there is therere stark differences between myself and sen obama
636199 i think we should be in a post racial environment
636200 i think sen barack obama has done an admirable job of that i dont think he has race baited i think he has been very good about that
636201 the presumptive republican nominee has embarked on a bare knuckled barrage of negative advertising aimed at belittling mr obama
636202 if the shareholders of the new york times ever wonder why the papers ad revenue is plummeting and its share price tanking they need look no further than the hysterical reaction of the papers editors to any slight real or imagined against their preferred candidate
636203 sitting at home in his mothers basement and ranting into the ether between games of dungeons amp dragons
636204 sen john mccain of arizona is the only republican who promises to end the george bush style of governing from and on behalf of a small angry fringe
636205 mccain is still i think upset about the op ed not being printed
636206 a lot of the maverick positioning is now turning into more conservative positioning and some of that includes not being afraid to go negative not being afraid to call a liberal a liberal and not being afraid to go after a newspaper
636207 latte drinking sushi eating volvo driving new york times reading
636208 has really become a symbol for a lot of conservative grievances
636209 for starters their editorials are decidedly liberal thats a no brainer and there are often complaints that even their general reporting is biased in subtle and not so subtle ways the new york times has come to be associated with the northeast liberal establishment
636210 the higher cost of crude oil used in the refining process was not fully recovered in the price of gasoline and other refined products
636211 as a result our downstream operations incurred a loss in the second quarter with most of the loss taking place in the united states
636212 while some might have chosen to exhaust their legal options to try to force their way into the games jessica instead chose to put her teams interests ahead of her own
636213 ive never wanted to do anything remotely close to doping its never ever crossed my mind ive never been approached about doing it its never been an issue my entire career its the last thing i would ever do
636214 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while
636215 this puts a key part of the dashboard in place
636216 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic
636217 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history
636218 evidence of a failure by government and society to do what it takes to control the epidemic
636219 we have been inadequately funding this epidemic all along we need to step it up
636220 everybodys trying to figure out how to lower levels of acrylamide without significantly adversely affecting taste
636221 you know its not about you its about your country
636222 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
636223 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
636224 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
636225 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
636226 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
636227 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
636228 if al gore is upset about carbon we must need more of it
636229 my bet would be on policy decision as usual however
636230 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
636231 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
636232 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
636233 but you can put it on the agenda and try to move the country
636234 a 90 percent chance that the us has contributed 2 degrees f of temperature increase in the last 50 years
636235 what a great big long grand x you have dear n
636236 and the quickest and easiest way to back out the coal which is the worst of the problem and oil is to look at electricity generation
636237 i also think that the coal and oil industries can play a big role in this if they will make good on the promise that carbon capture and sequestration will be real

636243 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
636244 gee i guess we ought to drive a bit less
636245 we need more onramps and parking lots and big box stores to fuel our auto centric lifestyle and bring in more tax revenue

636315 there is water everywhere we are facing a lot of problem five six people have also been bitten by snake and are in a critical condition all our belongings have been washed away in the floodwaters the government is not coming to our aid and is not helping us in any way
636316 we are providing immediate relief to the villagers we are supplying them with food our medical teams are also regularly patrolling the areas to keep a check on the villagers as there is a fear of outbreak of diseases
636317 this rally also known as the first friendship rally and is organised by a young man jimmy mistry with a vision he visualizes the youngsters especially the parsis getting together and knowing each other
636318 parsi resource group has been organizing motorcycle drive for the last two years and its a good way of getting the community together and passing the message of peace this time all the people who drove cars and did not have a motorcycle were feeling left out so we decided to have a drive and not just a motorcycle drive had we conducted this rally inside the mumbai city it would have been too congested and hence we decided to take the drive to lonavala and come back it is just the way of passing the message of peace on a friendship day
636319 its parsi community a small community as you know this rally is for a good cause of propagating friendship among all the parsis people so we will make more friends as we go along and we hope to have a good time

636323 for six years dr ivins fully cooperated with that investigation assisting the government in every way that was asked of him
636324 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation
636325 in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
636326 hes bright clean conservative but not angry and jewish hes a great fundraiser and locks up virginia for good measure
636327 im so moved its been a long wait even if we have to wait for hours it is worthwhile
636328 the torch represents peace and harmony the olympic spirit will give us strength to rebuild
636329 theres a lot of glory in having the torch come here this is our way of showing our support
636330 we have had so much sadness buried deep within us
636331 the torch relay will help it all burst from within us and dissipate
636332 also regrettable but i dont think china is regressing the way that russia is we have a greater opportunity to work in a cooperative way with china
636333 we understand as the dalai lama does that tibet is part of china but we hope tibetans are not repressed or oppressed

636349 why is it that barack obama cant consistently overshoot 50 and john mccain cant comfortably crack 45 in the national polls
636350 thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded

636356 some days i feel as if i do not actually speak the english language

636367 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
636368 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
636369 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
636370 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
636371 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
636372 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
636373 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
636374 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
636375 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
636376 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
636377 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
636378 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
636379 it was made into a bad movie in the 1970s starring the admirable george c scott
636380 but i have always been convinced that theres a great movie in this book and this is the one we are going to make
636381 i said from the start if we got the boat right then the rest would fit into place it has to go from being a fishing boat in the first half of the film to a war vessel in the second half it was vital to me that it was genuinely built before the second world war so the hunt was on from the moment we got the go ahead for the movie
636382 its a 38ft american motor cabin cruiser a wooden hull 11 ft beam 3 ft draught a perfect match to the boat hemingway described
636383 it used to have a four cylinder flathead chrysler diesel engine but someone replaced it with a v8 general motors gasoline car engine it turned the boat into a virtual bomb it looked like a bucket of rusty bolts so i sent some guys to move it to a good boatyard
636384 it was 12 knots on a boat which was not seaworthy after a nine hour journey we navigated in by torchlight to the new yard
636385 we will then take her to an undisclosed location and protect her like an unborn child
636386 but it means that you will see 27m of the 32m on the screen there are certain things that are meant to be and if youre lucky enough in life to eventually get there then that is a great achievement this is the project that is meant to be for me
636387 i put a lot of myself in to those roles
636388 in the valley of elah was an important film because we were looking at how the iraq war impacts on local communities across america with the loss of family members its a tragedy that carries on
636389 he is so focused tommy never wants to waste time and sometimes we were having a bit too much fun for him
636390 my belief is that we should never waste a day
636391 and when you are working and acting is our work there should be total concentration on what you are trying to achieve anything less than that then you are cheating yourself and short changing others
636392 in the end i didnt think i could make it as a professional sportsman so i thought that acting could make a great alternative life
636393 its still sport of a kind with winners and losers you also have to be fit to survive its not that first or second part or even big role which is so difficult its maintaining it over years
636394 no im a private person i hate everything about this business that intrudes on my life including these interviews but i do them to promote the movies because it helps people im fond of
636395 there is a terrific battle between an 11 year old boy and a 1 000lb blue marlin which i am looking forward to filming that is when the boat comes into its own
636396 this movie might be set in the past but it is about you and me now
636397 it is not a chick flick not a thriller killer not a quirky romance
636398 i want it to be a really good movie exciting from minute to minute frame to frame this is for people who want to see something different

636404 saya cukup puas atas prestasi tofi di china karena kita tetap bisa mendapat medali emas di saat negara lain tidak mampu mengalahkan china pelajar indonesia tetap bisa berprestasi sebenarnya pelajar kita memiliki kemampuan yang tidak kalah daripada china atau negara lainnya cuma perlu dibekali lagi supaya mereka tidak blunder saat ujian saya berharap indonesia bisa jadi juara umum dalam olimpiade fisika internasional di iran juli nanti
636405 kita harus berbangga bahwa prestasi pelajar indonesia dalam kompetisi internasional tidak kalah dibandingkan dengan negara lain prestasi ini merupakan salah satu pencapaian prestasi pendidikan nasional
636406 karena itu rusia sangat berminat memperdalam dan mengembangkan kerja sama dengan indonesia dalam berbagai bidang
636407 saya ingin mengucapkan selamat kepada presiden yudhoyono dan kepada seluruh pemimpin indonesia atas prestasi prestasi di bidang ekonomi di tahun tahun belakangan ini derajat indonesia di gelanggang internasional semakin tinggi
636408 indonesia mendapatkan kehormatan yang tinggi atas kunjungan ini kita semua berharap dan yakin kunjungan beliau kali ini akan dapat meningkatkan kerja sama kemitraan dan hubungan baik antara indonesia dan rusia di waktu yang akan datang
636409 banyak sekali kegiatan saling mendukung antarpihak rusia dan indonesia dalam forum global
636410 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
636411 we could further increase the value and efficiency of a unified national grid by helping our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars an electric vehicle fleet would sharply reduce the cost of driving a car reduce pollution and increase the flexibility of our electricity grid
636412 hi mom this is john doe your son you believe me dont you
636413 oil generates only 3 percent of our electricity therefore a 100 percent renewable electricity system does little to reduce our oil dependency
636414 we can not drill our way out of this crisis regarding oil
636415 americans hate being dependent for our mobility and therefore for our livelihoods on countries often hostile to our way of life

636418 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
636419 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
636420 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
636421 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
636422 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
636423 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
636424 until youve heard andy debate al gore you havent lived
636425 does frankf38 know anything at all about cars or energy
636426 cheering hooting and salivating youd expect at a campus rally
636427 while obama got a warm and even rousing welcome the audience was not cheering his every word
636428 one sure way to get applause from the crowd in the cavernous skyline ballroom for the opening ceremony was to mention sundays appearance
636429 many journalists in the audience leapt to their feet and applauded enthusiastically after being told not to do so during a two minute break halfway through the event journalists ran to the stage to snap photos of obama
636430 obama received a standing ovation from many in the audience at the start and end of his appearance there was also a rush toward the stage after his speech as obama shook hands and signed autographs one journalist was also overheard wishing him luck while another squealed he touched me as she left the ballroom
636431 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
636432 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
636433 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
636434 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
636435 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
636436 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
636437 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
636438 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
636439 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
636440 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
636441 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
636442 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
636443 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
636444 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
636445 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
636446 i am in keeping with the vision of one ronald reagan
636447 theres a lot of us voting against obama more than anything else
636448 over the years there are a lot of issues ive disagreed with you about and i would like to know how do you assure me and other conservatives that you will hold to our values and give me something to be excited about
636449 everywhere i go i am hearing the same thing i am uneasy about obama and i think mccain is going to win
636450 it is win win all the way this fiery take no prisoners attitude is what will do it for him for the first time he is really beginning to get his moorings
636451 climate change my friend i have to tell you with all due respect is real its real and the question is how do we address it
636452 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
636453 unlike barack obama john mccains words are backed up by his votes and his many conservative achievements and conservatives take great comfort in his remarkable record
636454 that was just resting there as a negative issue but the approach he is taking is making it a positive
636455 why is obama not doing better in the national polls after his overseas trip
636456 is mr obama really struggling are these summer polls truly evidence of underperformance or fundamental weaknesses in his campaign
636457 voters might just not be ready to make a decision quite this early
636458 the idea was simple give u k readers frustrated with the bush administration a way to help drive him from office the left wing newspaper targeted one swing county in one swing state in ohio and invited readers to send one on one letters to independent american voters
636459 the response was huge and immediate more than 11 000 guardian readers across britain and soon around the world signed up for the project but almost as soon as operation clark county was announced right leaning media and bloggers counterattacked they masqueraded as interested lefties and got the paper to hand over some of the voters addresses
636460 consider this stay out of american electoral politics unless you would like a company of us navy seals republican to a man to descend upon the offices of the guardian bag the lot of you and transport you to guantanamo bay where you can share quarters with some lonely taliban shepherd boys
636461 in 2000 al gore won clark county by 324 votes
636462 kerry won every gore county in ohio except clark nowhere among the gore counties did more votes move from the blue to the red column than in clark
636463 so why isnt obamas camp and the democrats offering a more spirited defense is the party too smug or cocky or decent to roll up its sleeves and fight fire with fire
636464 obviously senator clinton will play a major role in the convention but we have not finalized the program yet and are not making any announcements at all about the program yet
636465 dr zawahiri was enjoying a meal when the earth suddenly heated up by several thousand degrees
636466 the way it happened makes al gore look like a prophet
636467 dr zawahiri was enjoying a meal when the earth suddenly heated up by several thousand degrees
636468 the way it happened makes al gore look like a prophet
636469 but i resent when you throw out stupid allegations that have no merit and really no purpose other than to inflame
636470 for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father rom 8 23 and not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body rom 9 4 who are israelites to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of god and the promises gal 4 5 to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons eph 1 5 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will
636471 i object to the gentleman from california vote being counted he came down and voted late he said he was not in the chamber when his name was called and therefore hes not entitled to vote

636474 after about a year i became disinterested quit paying my dues and dropped my membership in the organization during the nine years that have followed i have never been interested in the klan
636475 the klan is needed today as never before and i am anxious to see its rebirth here in west virginia and in every state in the nation
636476 you have a talent for leadership bob the country needs young men like you in the leadership of the nation

636479 ive always said this document and the holy bible theyve been all the guidance i need
636480 much to be thankful for theres not much i wouldnt do over
636481 we just ask that in the end gods grace shines upon us
636482 he said and taking one hand to steady the other he slowly scratched his name on the gift thank you senator byrd http my barackobama com page community post jefferyfloyd ggbfbb aug 2 2008 at 8 50 pm
636483 i would never fight in the armed forces with a negro by my side rather i should die a thousand times and see old glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels
636484 it is appointed unto men once to die but after this the judgment
636485 spoiler is a word of political bigotry i dont recognize it at all
636486 i dont think small party candidates or third party candidates are second class citizens
636487 spoiled our political system theyve turned the government over to big business
636488 none of us should be considered spoilers unless we all are spoilers
636489 it seems a vicious circle if youre not on the debates you dont reach tens of millions of people i can guarantee you if i was on the presidential debates the polls would surge
636490 are you a sports fan do you know any sports player who gives up
636491 has provided documents to the campaign as it combs through his background according to several sources close to kaine sens evan bayh ind and joseph r biden jr del are also being seriously vetted by the campaign staff according to sources with knowledge of the process
636492 to recap kaine was a city councilman in richmond for 4 terms a two term mayor of richmond lieutenant governor of virginia for 4 years and governor of virginia for 3 years no al gore there
636493 doesnt have to be pro choice or pro gay rights
636494 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
636495 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
636496 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
636497 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
636498 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
636499 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
636500 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
636501 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
636502 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
636503 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
636504 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
636505 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
636506 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
636507 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
636508 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
636509 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
636510 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
636511 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
636512 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
636513 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
636514 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
636515 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
636516 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
636517 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
636518 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
636519 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
636520 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
636521 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
636522 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
636523 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
636524 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
636525 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
636526 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
636527 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
636528 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
636529 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
636530 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
636531 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
636532 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm
636533 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
636534 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
636535 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
636536 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
636537 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
636538 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
636539 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
636540 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next

636545 im convinced that the marketing and pr experts surrounding the obamas clued in to the enormous influence that celebrities have had on the american public particularly women over the past seven years since the emergence of us weekly star and other celebrity newsweeklies and the subsequent explosion of celebrity news and they want to take advantage of the deep affection that americans have developed for celebrities
636546 more than most presidential candidates the obamas have to introduce themselves and make sure the american public is comfortable with them they havent been on the national stage that long
636547 and they need to go in short lead publications like people and us weekly they cant wait another month or two for monthly magazine interviews they want the american public to understand who they are and who they are as a family immediately

636555 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives

636586 were never going to create a gore free resident evil title to try and get a lower rating as its a game about the horror experience and gore is part of that
636587 were primarily about making great games and if its appropriate to the title we wont shy away from making a 15 or 18 title
636588 intellectuals found it very amusing ive got it all figured out he replied with a smile and id tell you but its much too confusing
636589 the chief duty of a human being is to endure life
636590 the chief end of man is to glorify god and enjoy him forever
636591 for everyone has sinned we all fall short of gods glorious standard
636592 its your sins that have cut you off from god
636593 but god showed his great love for us by sending christ to die for us while we were still sinners
636594 there is salvation in no one else god has given no other name under heaven by which we must be saved
636595 dont let your hearts be troubled trust in god and trust also in me
636596 all who believed him and accepted him he gave the right to become children of god john 1 12 if we believe him and accept him as savior we can become a child of god
636597 and i am convinced that nothing can ever separate us from gods love neither death nor life neither angels nor demons neither our fears for today nor our worries about tomorrow not even the powers of hell can separate us from gods love no power in the sky above or in the earth below indeed nothing in all creation will ever be able to separate us from the love of god that is revealed in christ jesus our lord
636598 therefore since we have been made right in gods sight by faith we have peace with god because of what jesus christ our lord has done for us

636602 we made an enquiry for the player but we couldnt reach an agreement so we move on i would suggest it is dead in the water
636603 my philosophy when youve got an interest in a player is that you know what your value of that footballer is if it cant be done it cant be done and you move on
636604 getting into the champions league is not going to be easy
636605 to break into that quartet is tough but a number of quality players have come in and well be doing our best to get amongst it
636606 as soon as he came you could see why he was so successful at other clubs
636607 hell would have to freeze over for us to sell dean to a major rival
636608 as soon as we heard of the interest in robbie those of us who know him wanted the deal to happen
636609 we know what he can add to the side and alongside fernando torres we feel weve a strikeforce to rival any in the premier league
636610 a lot of liverpool fans see similarities to when we signed gary mcallister in 2000 youd hear people say how we should have signed him years ago
636611 the same applies with robbie he probably should have been here five or six years earlier
636612 keane and torres showed good movement and linked well with gerrard yossi benayoun and dirk kuyt
636613 all five offensive players were very clever and showed a lot of quality
636614 keane has settled in really well and i hope were going to continue to see these movements and goals in the future
636615 i dont think the morale aspect has got anything to do with it it was a friendly game and i dont think the morale will be a problem
636616 the problem is getting back to a level of play that will allow us to compete in a better manner
636617 we have to get up and playing there is no running away from that and we have to do it very quickly
636618 it was evident in the first half hour of the game on wednesday that we werent up there weve got a bit to do to pick up on and we have to do it quickly
636619 its been like that for years and there is no point complaining about it we have managed to compete in a better manner beforehand so its no excuse
636620 we know that situation is there and we have handled it better in previous matches even in pre season games last year
636621 its just a fact we have to face that we are not reaching the same level as we did do even in the early part of last season
636622 we didnt take a lot from the game apart from the fact that we were well beaten
636623 there were no excuses from our own point of view the first part of the game was the best part for us the second half we were poor
636624 overall liverpool were better and ive got no complaints about the result they could have scored more actually
636625 there was a balance to be achieved there in the sense of bringing an edge to our game for the champions league game
636626 when we we look at the result we were probably better not to have a game weve had the game and it was a disappointing result and performance for us
636627 they are two good players and liverpool are going to benefit although it may mean a change in emphasis for them in terms of the way theyve played in the last couple of seasons
636628 theyve got good players overall and i think they have an opportunity to be challenging for the title next season as much as finishing in the top four
636629 i am looking forward to playing for west ham and ill do my best to repay their faith in me
636630 its a big plus i think the co operation with him can help me a lot in improving my skills

636644 siamo rimasti interdetti ha detto valentina vezzali io conosco baldini da quando era bambino mi sembra impossibile tutto questo la scherma uno sport di abilit dove la testa sopperisce alle eventuali deficienze fisiche a cosa serve doparsi certo un po agitati lo siamo ma dobbiamo pensare alla nostra olimpiade questa per me la quarta olimpiade ho 34 anni devo dare tutto cerco di rimettermi in gioco in ogni momento della mia vita
636645 certo una situazione non bella e non piacevole siamo rimasti di sasso io non ho mai sentito di casi del genere non penso che ci sia bisogno di fare queste cose e un caso in 100 anni di storia mi dispiace moltissimo per baldini non so cosa pensare di queste polemiche con cassar ma io devo anche pensare a difendere la mia medaglia doro

636666 the brain does not simply gather and stockpile information as a computers hard drive does facts are stored first in the hippocampus a structure deep in the brain about the size and shape of a fat mans curled pinkie finger but the information does not rest there every time we recall it our brain writes it down again and during this re storage it is also reprocessed in time the fact is gradually transferred to the cerebral cortex and is separated from the context in which it was originally learned for example you know that the capital of california is sacramento but you probably dont remember how you learned it this phenomenon known as source amnesia can also lead people to forget whether a statement is true even when a lie is presented with a disclaimer people often later remember it as true

636672 i dont really know what is was just couldnt really find a rhythm with my mechanics i dont think anything was off but i just couldnt really find a rhythm couldnt feel comfortable and it was a grind to get through seven and mikey picked me up had a couple of great plays at third it always helps when the offense is going out there and putting up that amount of runs it takes pressure off you to be too fine you can just go attack guys and hopefully get quick innings
636673 i learned on friday that you dont come in the dugout with your helmet on after you score a run because you get pounded in the head pretty good i took that thing off immediately when i got there

636678 its a matter of pride this muslim family has proved how much keen they are to see the national flag is respected by all through this they are spreading their patriotism and secondly they are fulfilling their daily necessities
636679 this is creating awareness among muslim families and they are becoming a part of it this type of business involves three families the one who weaves the other one dyes and the third family stitches their work teams up employment with the spirit of nationalism for these families this will help strengthen the country and will spread all over

636692 singapore based global investment company profitable group which includes former england star steve mcmahon as a director also want to buy ashley out
636693 the newcastle chief admitted last month he is anxious to find investors to ease the financial burden
636694 ashley however was not able to spend anywhere near as lavishly as most of the newcastle united players demanded
636695 he has made it clear he will not sanction the kind of huge signings which might help challenge for a champions league place
636696 one has to play according ot needs of the team not according ot his whims and fancies i would prefer a player who atleast is consistent even though he doesnt score triple hundren rather than this guy who blasts his way to triple hundred and then for the next few innings is useless identify one player in any international team who has such an attitude
636697 im very happy to be no 1 being no 1 is a present for a lot of work
636698 very happy but at the same time my goals continue to be there the olympics the u s open theres no time to enjoy its a big satisfaction to be the no 1 but we can celebrate when the season is done

636700 you know someone like nadal who i think is going to go down as one of the best players ever is going to play well for a whole season
636701 i think it was a matter of a tournament and a year or a season when hes going to start to play better and better on hardcourts because he has all the things that he needs to play well on any surface hes proven that hes even this year the best player on grass if you look at his style of the game you dont think that he might do really well on that surface which is the fastest in the sport but he obviously does really well
636702 you mean he hit the shopping cart backed up then tried to hit her too

636741 configuration management provides the foundation for successful it service management and underpins every other process the fundamental deliverable is the configuration management database cmdb comprising one or more integrated databases detailing all of the organisations it infrastructure components and other important associated assets it is these assets that deliver it services and they are known as configuration items cis what set a cmdb apart from an ordinary asset register are the relationships or links that define how each ci is interconnected and interdependent with its neighbours
636742 detailing all of the organisations it infrastructure components and other important associated assets
636743 the relationships or links that define how each ci is interconnected and interdependent with its neighbours
636744 depends on but only at the end of the month
636745 depends on to meet a gold sla but can manage without it for silver
636746 theres no standard in the industry for how a vendor should build the data model inside the cmdb
636747 theres a huge propensity to lock into one vendor for all of this
636748 customers are just trying to get a handle on what a cmdb can do
636749 at best a discovery tool will only discover 50 of what you have in your infrastructure the rest has to come from logical definition
636750 the customer issue is not about itil and doing process for the sake of process you have to find what business issues is senior management concerned with and how implementing itil can help implementing itil for the sake of itil doesnt work you have do the complete work of tying into a specific set of pains issues and value
636751 cmdb cant be done not with a justifiable return on investment of doing it
636752 who has the time to read dissect and understand all of them
636753 the first problem is to achieve a manageable configuration then populate the cmdb with it
636754 what set a cmdb apart from an ordinary asset register are the relationships or links that define how each ci is interconnected and interdependent with its neighbours

636757 we dachten u moet toch ergens heen u moet vannacht toch een bed hebben u heeft geen geld en het lijkt er op dat u aan geheugenverlies lijdt we hebben overleg gehad en we denken dat het wellicht een oplossing is als we u indien u hiermee akkoord gaat natuurlijk naar een psychiatrische kliniek brengen daar zijn artsen die u eventueel verder kunnen onderzoeken u heeft dan in ieder geval een dak boven uw hoofd en wij kunnen hier gaan kijken of u als vermist bent opgegeven wij kunnen ook uw foto via interpol verspreiden en proberen zo uw identiteit te achterhalen wel wat zegt u hiervan
636758 ik heb het rapport uit frankrijk gelezen waarin staat dat u aan geheugenverlies lijdt men neemt daar aan dat dit werkelijk zo is al moet ik u zeggen dat een aantal deskundigen van ons hier nog aan twijfelen u zult echter grondig onderzocht worden en een aantal testen moeten ondergaan verder krijgt u gesprekken met een psycholoog en zal een psychiater u begeleiden omdat u nogal forse medicatie gebruikt op voorschrift van de franse kliniek men heeft mij ingeschakeld om u op de hoogte te stellen van de feiten waarvan u verdacht wordt

636770 that night he dreamt of horses in a field on a high plain where the spring rains had brought up the grass and the wildflowers out of the ground and the flowers ran all blue and yellow far as the eye could see and in the dream he was among the horses running and in the dream he himself could run with the horses and they coursed the young mares and fillies over the plain where their rich bay and their rich chestnut colors shone in the sun and the young colts ran with their dams and trampled down the flowers in a haze of pollen that hung in the sun like high mesas where the ground resounded under their running hooves and they flowed and changed and ran and their manes and tails blew off of them like spume and there was nothing else at all in that high world and they moved all of them in a resonance that was like a music among them and they were none of them afraid horse nor colt nor mare and they ran in that resonance which is the world itself and which cannot be spoken but only priased

636773 der lask spielt mit einem 4 4 1 1 system vorne spielen mit vastic und mayrleb zwei routiniers vastic kenne ich nat rlich von der em
636774 ich habe geh rt dass der lask sehr beweglich und mit viel mut nach vorne spielt
636775 zwischen den partien liegen 75 stunden normalerweise braucht ein fitter spieler 60 bis 64 stunden zum regenerieren au erdem haben wir gegen bananz nicht vollgas gegeben gegen den lask werden wir das tun
636776 wir haben berhaupt keinen druck salzburg ist eine internationale supertruppe mit 30 klassespielern sie haben mehr qualit t und substanz als wir das wei jeder in unseren reihen f hlt sich niemand als favorit
636777 wir m ssen mit mut und selbstvertrauen dagegenhalten und frei im kopf sein es kann alles passieren
636778 zulegen kann man immer unterm strich z hlt aber immer nur das ergebnis
636779 k rnten ist berall sehr forsch aufgetreten und hat eine hohe leistungs und laufbereitschaft gezeigt wir d rfen uns davon aber nicht aus der ruhe bringen lassen das ist eine tolle truppe mit gutem zusammenhalt
636780 es wird schwieriger als gegen die austria die spielen mit der wut im bauch
636781 er muss sich erst akklimatisieren wird sicher noch zweieinhalb wochen brauchen
636782 wir waren schon in unseren ausw rtsspielen gegen austria rapid und lask die bessere mannschaft jetzt muss es endlich einmal mit punkten klappen
636783 die rieder haben eine sehr starke mannschaft das habe ich gesehen als ich sie gegen kapfenberg und die austria beobachtet habe
636784 our operations are first class and are continually subject to the scrutiny of australian and overseas regulators as well as our own internal audits
636785 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits
636786 fuel prices have doubled in the past year a successful hedging programme mitigated the impact but nevertheless fuel costs at 706 million were up 233 million in the quarter we expect our fuel bill to top 3 billion this year the equivalent of more than 8 million every day
636787 this campaign was always going to be closer than many people thought it would be
636788 poor obama seems to have thought it wouldnt be close at all
636789 sometimes its hard to tell if barack obama is running for president or mr universe
636790 not like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
636791 if anyone thinks that picking a woman will simply placate hillary clintons supporters i think thats very patronising
636792 a lot of the tactics they used were designed to isolate him from his support the fbi just continued to push his buttons
636793 and you could leave usamriid with nothing more than a couple of vials bear in mind they werent exactly doing body searches of scientists back then
636794 one of the great strengths of this campaign from the very beginning has been the cohesion the sense of camaraderie and the lack of drama
636795 and one of the challenges moving forward is to expand and bring in more talent people from other campaigns and other places and still maintain that culture we began with i think its happening but its a process and it fights the normal physics of national politics
636796 specifically sought out people who are going to play by those rules

636800 the first time with the benefit fraud my wife was absolutely horrified with the second one she was a mess she had health problems and she just went down and down and down
636801 im utterly disgusted for the simple reason that we thought in febuary now we can get over this
636802 its been hanging over our heads for three years and now were back to square one
636803 we came to that view in view of his medical condition and the difficulties he was encountering in prison
636804 however we noted this does not detract from the fact that he has a considerable and long record of fraudulent behaviour
636805 in the end his medical condition at the moment is such that the board cannot confidently decline his parole on the basis that he is an undue risk to the community
636806 we think his activities might well be restricted by virtue of his medical condition
636807 did fergie really mean that many lumps because im pretty sure those lumps arent very lady like

636813 republican john mccain and democrat barack obama are once again tied in the latest gallup poll daily obama received a brief increase in support near the conclusion of his overseas trip last week gaining a nine percentage point advantage in july 24 26 polling but that bounce disappeared almost quickly as it emerged
636814 famous for no reason just a pretty face the ad implies but loitering below is something more nefarious obama dog whistles the ad hitting old racists in the sweet spot could f k these white girls
636815 ive covered a lot of campaigns and ive never seen anything like this
636816 presidential election campaigns usually youre working all the time you get to the hotel at two in the morning and youre back on the plane at six but mccain does one event a day one event its unbelievable

636838 on thursday there was a meeting between gareths agent myself and the player
636839 even though the deadline had passed they still felt liverpool were going to come in and do the deal
636840 obviously i was disappointed to hear that gareths head is a bit all over the place at the moment and they asked for some more time i listened to what theyve said and ill go with it reluctantly but ill go with it
636841 there will be no deadline and liverpool have all the time in the world now to sign gareth barry theyve got up to the normal window which is the 31st of this month
636842 steven is clever and a quality player can play in different positions
636843 in a 4 2 3 1 he can play in four positions
636844 with 4 4 2 it doesnt matter as he can play as a winger or a striker
636845 we prepared two or three different options but felt it best to stay in europe
636846 we dont have any doubts that the club is working hard to get a solution to this matter
636847 well have to see whats going to happen we always knew that it was going to be a complicated matter it will obviously not be easy for him to come to madrid but put the question to any football coach and all of them would say theyd love to have a player like ronaldo

636850 youtube is a great platform for dialogue and i believe we need to use that platform to get our message out there
636851 i do feel that our world is in a bit of a crisis at the moment violence has overtaken dialogue and compassion has lost out to anger im hoping this will become a channel of communication between east and west because i very much think our world is in dire need of that
636852 theyre trying to ride a wave which is that people have lost faith in state run media they dont read newspapers so youtube is a very interesting platform for the queen to use to attract young people
636853 she and her husband want to influence young people away from radicalism into a more pragmatic centrist thought
636854 here is an idea give up all religions and be atheist so we would not be bound by religions or have stereotypes about other religions
636855 first let me say you continue to impress and inspire me as a teenage girl from the usa i was surprised to find that in your hopes and wishes you could relate to me as your cultural religious and social backgrounds are so different from mine it amazes me that women worldwide can connect through the desire for progress

636871 we celebrate wealth power strength bravado confidence prestige and victory beginning with little league baseball for our kids and continuing right on through to their sat scores college admissions first job and first address we abhor and fear weakness failure struggle and doubt even though we know that a measure of vulnerability fear discouragement and depression accompany most normal lives we construe these as signs of failure or even a lack of faith in real life naive optimism and the rosy rhetoric is a recipe for disappointment and discouragement sooner or later reality catches up with most of us
636872 what have i done that god would punish me so by taking my mother
636873 i am sorry lady but your mom was 92 she had been sick forever did you not prepare yourself for the fact that she was supposed to die nobody else in here had a loved one who lived as long as your mother so be thankful and get over it
636874 my 13 and 16 year old daughters were killed in a car wreck three weeks ago when they were hit by a drunk driver who do you think you are lady that you are so important that god would hurt another human being to punish you or to get your attention

636939 i said to the yogurt mamas this morning after they expressed many thanks for our visit and for our support
636940 we teach you about probiotic yogurt you teach us about life
636941 we all out support it were talking about aids which is a big threat
636942 historically we have competition economically with kenya and uganda but invariably we are the best
636943 if you need change in your diet why not women
636944 at the community level we have so many resources available but we need a framework for decentralizing them
636945 this is the only project like this in all of kenya so you are leading the way for the country
636946 my argument has always been who brings food brings life
636947 excuse me i would like a cold bottle of water thank you
636948 he fits the profile that we had advanced but they would like to see the evidence
636949 the family definitely wants to be able to see the evidence that the fbi has accumulated that theyre not just trying to make this guy a scapegoat allowing them to close their file and be done with it
636950 so we gather the facts and then we ponder the facts and we just wait and see what develops
636951 my head and my heart says that saying anything detrimental unkind toward this man only hurts his family because theyre the ones left to sort through and to wade through all of this
636952 we have to remember they lost someone they loved also
636953 those are the only times when i consider the fact that this is not normal
636954 this is not the type of person i was seven years ago
636955 too indeed obama has been on the universitys faculty and lives a few blocks north of campus in kenwood which is usually considered part of the hyde park area
636956 say to people here you got to go along with conventional wisdom and they say no you dont
636957 i would guess 92 percent of hyde parkers are for obama
636958 teds dedication and focus has helped airgas become a leader in the co2 business

636970 nuestros equipos han viajado a cada una de las playas de francia espa a portugal e italia hemos evaluado todas las playas de forma independiente utilizando para ello m s de 100 criterios tales como limpieza instalaciones y facilidad para nadar la calidad de las playas es muy importante para los turistas muchos de ellos quieren pasar todo el tiempo en la playa una playa en malas condiciones puede arruinar unas vacaciones onbeach com proporciona detalles de cada playa en ocho idiomas ayudamos a los turistas a saber m s acerca de una playa concreta antes de que reserven sus vacaciones
636971 he visitado cientos de playas del caribe y sigo creyendo que las playas mediterr neas tienen la l nea costera m s bella y diversa del mundo
636972 the kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field a mustard seed which a man planted in his field yeast a woman took and mixed into about sixty pounds of flour
636973 ein perfektes wochenende mit zwei poles und zwei siegen allerdings waren es keine leichten rennen f r mich im zehnten lauf lag ich nach sechs runden mit 1 5 sekunden vorsprung vor dem fahrerfeld doch dann sah ich auf den schildern meiner mechaniker dass esteban richtig gas gab
636974 mein puls stieg doch ich konzentrierte mich bis zum schluss nach meinen zweiten pl tzen in barcelona und zolder musste ich in budapest feststellen dass sieger immer eine besonders heftige champagnerdusche von den kollegen erhalten man kann sich nicht vorstellen wie das in den augen brennt
636975 an diesem wochenende konnte ich viel lernen durch den rennunfall am samstag mit adrien bekam ich keine punkte und musste mich f r das n chste rennen mental gut einstellen es funktionierte ich wurde zweiter und ich wei dass viele fahrer gern an meiner stelle auf dem podium gestanden h tten deshalb sind nicht nur siege ein erfolg f r mich es sind diese art von erfahrungen die einen weiter bringen
636976 insgesamt habe ich mir von diesem wochenende mehr erhofft erst recht nach meinem qualifying mit zwei startpl tzen aus der ersten reihe generell ist es nicht einfach auf dieser strecke zu berholen da muss man schon ganz sch n nah dran sein ich versuche jetzt nach vorn zu blicken der stadtkurs in valencia ist f r jeden fahrer neu man kennt nur eine streckenskizze oder das ein oder andere video da werden die karten neu gemischt
636977 why arent you happy were you ever happy you never smiled
636978 im okay im okay im okay dont worry mom im okay
636979 ich freue mich nat rlich ber den f nften rang das war mal ein schritt
636980 nat rlich ist es sch n vor kimi r ikk nen zu stehen aber ich w rde mich mehr freuen wenn wir die konstanz f r den rest des jahres hinein bringen w rden
636981 das war eine super leistung besser geht es nicht wenn das auto gut ist dann kann er auch solche leistungen zeigen
636982 dass der junge saugut ist steht schon seit seinem ersten punkt damals in montreal fest er hat sich seitdem seine sporen verdient und ist ein ausgewachsener formel 1 fahrer der junge ist erste klasse
636983 ich hatte immer gedacht es w rde f r ihn schwer gegen jarno trulli
636984 ich hatte immer gedacht es w rde f r ihn schwer gegen jarno trulli der hat immerhin bei toyota die formel 1 karriere von ralf schumacher beendet
636985 aber wenn man so einen mann schl gt dann ist man auf einem guten weg und wenn man das mehrmals schafft hat man einen festen platz in der formel 1
636986 leichte schl ge auf den hinterkopf erh hen die schnelligkeit es ist typisch f r fahrer die einen unfall hatten dass sie danach der ganzen welt etwas beweisen wollen
636987 er war in budapest auch in der gp2 schon schnell die strecke liegt ihm
636988 vor vier f nf rennen h tte noch niemand gesagt dass er f hig ist sogar in die erste reihe zu fahren er ist nicht weit weg von der spitze
636989 sein technisches verst ndnis und seine arbeitseinstellung bringen ihn voran und er war nicht zufrieden das spricht f r ihn
636990 das war eine klasse vorstellung das freut mich sehr f r ihn
636991 gary was war in dieser dtm saison bisher f r dich der beste moment
636992 ich denke der beste moment war ganz klar als ich den vierten platz am n rburgring geholt habe davor war der f nfte platz am norisring ein sch nes erlebnis ich mag den kurs und es war ein wirklich tolles rennen allerdings lagen sch ne und nicht so sch ne momente am norisring eng zusammen denn ich wurde ja aus der wertung genommen das war schon entt uschend aber ich denke der schlimmste moment in dieser saison war als ich am lausitzring im qualifying nur 17 wurde vielleicht muss man sich nur meine ergebnisse anschauen um zu sagen welche meine besten momente waren lacht anm d red
636993 welche ziele hast du dir f r den rest der saison gesteckt
636994 wenn man realistisch ist k nnen wir nur versuchen punkte zu holen das muss unser ziel sein die erste vorgabe ist immer so schnell zu sein wie m glich der beste mercedes jahreswagen zu sein und die 07er audis zu schlagen dann sehen wir was damit m glich ist und versuchen punkte zu holen das ist an jedem rennwochenende das ziel
636995 wenn man realistisch ist k nnen wir nur versuchen punkte zu holen
636996 du bist zwischendrin auch f r vodafone mclaren mercedes in der formel 1 als testfahrer im einsatz ist es schwierig zwischen den beiden autos hin und her zu wechseln
636997 ich habe mich daran gew hnt am anfang war das schon eine umstellung aber ich habe vor dem n rburgring wochenende am dienstag noch in jerez das formel 1 auto getestet und bin dann an den n rburgring gekommen das schien v llig problemlos zu gehen das war das erste mal dass ich innerhalb so kurzer zeit beide autos gefahren bin also innerhalb von drei tagen nat rlich merkt man die unterschiede und es braucht auch etwas zeit bis man sich daran gew hnt hat aber inzwischen kann ich schnell hin und her wechseln das macht mir keine probleme
636998 ist das formel 1 testen ein ganz anderer job als das dtm fahren
636999 es gibt schon unterschiede schon allein in der arbeitsweise der teams und auch die arbeit die man als fahrer leistet ist unterschiedlich in der formel 1 testet man normalerweise immer neue komponenten in der dtm dagegen arbeitet man am set up und versucht das zu verfeinern das sind schon zwei paar stiefel aber beide teams sind hochprofessionell und machen einen ausgesprochen professionellen job wenn man sich das niveau der formel 1 ansieht und das geld das dort ausgegeben wird dann ist klar dass dort viel mehr leute arbeiten der fahrstil als solches unterscheidet sich dort aber nicht allzu sehr von dem in der dtm
637000 im moment gibt es vier neuwagen und vier piloten die sie fahren
637001 wie bewertest du deine chancen im n chsten jahr einen neuwagen zu bekommen geht das berhaupt wenn du nebenbei formel 1 tests f hrst
637002 die testfahrten sind da gar kein problem denn so oft teste ich ja nicht von daher sehe ich nicht dass das ein problem sein sollte im moment gibt es vier neuwagen und vier piloten die sie fahren deshalb gibt es kein freies cockpit im aktuellen auto man muss abwarten ob jemand geht oder ob es sonst eine ver nderung gibt bisher war ich deutlich der beste mercedes jahreswagenfahrer und wenn ergebnisse ausschlaggebend sein sollten dann sehe ich da auch kein problem ebenso wenig wie darin beide jobs zu machen das mache ich im augenblick ja auch und es st rt nicht meine konzentration auf die dtm
637003 hast du neben dtm und formel 1 zeit f r die familie oder f r hobbies
637004 man hat mit beiden jobs nat rlich viel zu tun aber ich habe schon zeit f r meine familie die ja mit meinem dritten kind gerade wieder gewachsen ist in jeder freien minute bin ich zu hause trainiere und verbringe so viel zeit wie m glich mit der familie hobbies habe ich nat rlich auch ich spiele gern golf aber in diesem jahr konnte ich bisher erst zweimal spielen weil ich so viel zu tun hatte ich betreibe auch gern andere sportarten es ist eben immer nur die frage ob ich zeit daf r finde
637005 ich werde sie nicht aufhalten wenn sie in den rennsport m chten
637006 harvey der ltere ist jetzt viereinhalb jahre alt und mag autos er mag aber auch viele andere sportarten es liegt ganz an ihnen was sie mal machen werden ich w rde mir aber schon w nschen dass sie irgendetwas im bereich sport machen da ich sport sehr mag aber ich stehe allem sehr offen gegen ber ich gebe ihnen die m glichkeit viele verschiedene sportarten auszuprobieren und wenn es an der zeit ist setze ich sie auch ins kart und schaue ob es ihnen gef llt aber ich werde sie sicher nicht unter druck setzen auf der anderen seite werde ich sie auch nicht aufhalten wenn sie in den rennsport m chten
637007 w rdest du dich freuen wenn eines der kinder auch rennfahrer wird
637008 john this is kinda a boy set did you know we were girls
637009 probably 15 or 16 from the looks of it and very beautiful she probably treated me

637020 why are they undertaking measures against bulgaria if they can go around our country then they do not have a problem
637021 they are preparing the situation this clique around the bulgarian socialist party and the movement for rights and freedoms so that if something happens with me they would be able to attribute it to some conflicts in the past
637022 brussels cannot replace governments because this would be considered interference with the countrys internal affairs so we chose a language that all people all over the world understand we stopped you money

637024 what is the easiest and most efficient way to make income online
637025 its great bringing my movie to a place that i feel familiar
637026 not like the cannes film festival where nobodys speaking english or the tribeca film festival where no one sits down
637027 theres something poetic about coming back to the place where i used to come for holidays camping trips with my dad and stepmother and my very large family
637028 she has such an incredible heart and such a generous spirit
637029 she does so much out of the glare of the lights to make the world a better place
637030 there arent a lot of role models for us in the world or people we can look up to
637031 people who are not afraid to stick their neck out people who are not afraid to stand up for things and be unpopular to go against the grain think outside the box
637032 and we need and i need michael moore in my life
637033 work 3 hours a week in your pajamas and quit your day job
637034 the boys were great even when we were down at halftime there was enough self belief in the boys
637035 they knew they had dominance up front and just had to convert that into points
637036 it was a great day for the team and the fans who were also fantastic
637037 you would have to say south africa are best placed to win the trophy in the fact that they have got three home games
637038 but we are in charge of our own destiny if we can win the remaining games then we have got a big show
637039 we struggle to win away too in the tri nations as does south africa
637040 youve got the three sides who are consistently in the top four in the world playing each other at home its bloody tough and you are going to lose games
637041 australia will come back they will change things a little bit weve just got to keep growing but were happy with where were heading
637042 probably the best thing was because we were under a lot of pressure and theres a group of young people involved in the team and there are a lot of new faces and for those guys to experience that and come through on the other side is i think really good for them
637043 youve got to try things and if you dont try things you dont learn things
637044 theres a long way to go in this competition and the great thing is were in a tri nations thats wide open
637045 youve just had a vivid example of how one week is no indicator of the next
637046 richie was obviously an inspiration to the people around him
637047 he was at the front end of everything not just physically but verbally and they responded to that
637048 thats what happens when the tide flows the other way
637049 youre more exposed when youre going backwards its a natural result of the way the momentum was going
637050 it didnt help but it wasnt a point of difference
637051 it happens when the tide turns and theres pressure built they were prepared to take a bit of a risk by contesting the throw it snowballed on us without a doubt
637052 we didnt build any pressure with the ball we had we didnt kick as good as we did last week
637053 we certainly wont be rushing macdonald back to play till he is ready
637054 we sent him home to be with his family and its like any head injury it will come right eventually
637055 he wasnt that far away but the doc will see him during the week and well make assessments if hes not right he wont be part of it
637056 were all pretty happy with the way richard went on saturday hes versatile enough to play at full back hes played a lot of football there for the highlanders in 2006
637057 he certainly handled the challenges on saturday night well so thats one option with rudi struggling with his knee that might be the option but well wait and see
637058 we will use tony woodcock as the thrower and john afoa as the hooker in the scrum
637059 tonys a very good thrower and has been doing a bit of work on it quietly in the background
637060 dont you remember what he did to you and how much it took you to get over him
637061 i marittimi del peschereccio valeria prim di mazara stanno bene tutto lequipaggio a bordo allinterno del porto commerciale di tripoli
637062 thats for the coaches to decide and im just trying to put my best foot forward
637063 im sure andy will come out firing in the next couple of weeks well just keep pushing each other and see what eventuates
637064 we had our backs against the wall like that after two losses
637065 the boys laid a good platform and i had a pretty easy run
637066 theyve worked with individuals throughout the week and i think it showed on saturday we won the kicking duel and that was probably a big aspect from last week that and the physical side of things
637067 it is an ongoing process them things arent behind me im still going through the process so ive just got to keep going about my things and play good footy let my rugby do the talking
637068 there is always pressure on the kickers its always a tough kick for a half back kicking inside your 22m its a 50 50 kick really you either get the right bounce or the wrong bounce there were a couple of wrong bounces on saturday but it certainly brings them forward and opens up spaces in behind
637069 i think we managed to do that they changed their structure a fair bit with the wee kicks it also takes a lot of pressure off dessie carter you cant always rely on him at 10
637070 it comes from the wingers and the backs i get a wee call but i sort of see it too as i am approaching a ruck

637075 both the previous two weeks we played some good footy but this was the one we needed to win to give us that break from fourth
637076 it was the classic eight point game for us today we have been building for that that was surprising going back to the start how we started but to be able to fight back was pleasing
637077 the win gives us four games clear of fourth with four games left
637078 there are a couple more blokes maybe carrying little things so we are able to get games into players that might be able to help us in september as well to refresh the stocks a bit we will need to get games into tim callan callan ward maybe peter street shaun higgins scott west will hopefully be back about round 20 21 but we dont want to flirt with our form we want good form going into september and we have four tough games
637079 theres an obligation on the environment agency to have to review these combined sewer overflows
637080 the problem is that the sewer system was designed for a climate which is different from the one we have got now
637081 the combined sewer overflows are starting to discharge a lot more often than they should their environmental impact is greatly increasing
637082 it amounts effectively to a licence to pollute because there are no restrictions on how much and how often these pipes can discharge
637083 we have identified around 3 500 remaining temporary consents for cso discharges
637084 these are mainly for storm overflows that are operating without causing problems
637085 as youd expect our priority has always been to focus on those consents that are a problem
637086 i can confirm that our servers were not compromised beyond that i cant offer much else obviously wed like to be as helpful as possible but since its related to customer data were rather limited in what we can discuss ive opened a ticket to make thq aware of this and we can will work them on tracking stuff down if we need to we do have a history of all versions of a file w filesizes md5 checksums and the dates times src ip of all revisions
637087 whats fun about being a grandma ive already done my time

637089 i left at 9 each night for work and would return in the morning
637090 the people who mess up arent going to stick around theyre going to try to go home wherever that may be they would be long gone
637091 if i came up dirty then my probation would be revoked
637092 i got the call at 9 30 a m and when your minor league manager calls you its one of three things youre either going up being released or being traded
637093 last year i struggled in tacoma waiting to get the call
637094 this year i changed my approach i decided not to look up here and just do my best ive been through this before brought up and sent down the bottom line is you still have to pitch well wherever you are ive worked hard ive competed
637095 with two lefties woods gives us the luxury of saving cesar jimenez until later in the game
637096 we talked about a number of pitchers in tacoma and from the information we got it was jake
637097 bunting is part of the game were trying to incorporate into yunis game
637098 i wondered over the last month whether he was 100 percent watching him throw because some of his throws werent getting to first base
637099 hes still the best shortstop in the league his offense needs work but his defense is so good that even when hes not at his best hes better than anyone else you can run out there

637112 there are a couple of literary thrillers from the last decades of the 20th century worth mentioning in passing because they approach noir in distinctive ways m s powers children of the north is an intense complex trilogy on the so called troubles in northern ireland in a dark graham greene vein and with a rich sense of both tragedy and comedy another novel on the troubles the psalm killer by christopher petit has an eerie quality of being both a documentary novel about the convoluted politics of northern ireland and a brutal thriller that has some common ground with silence of the lambs its also worth mentioning a few noir ish late 20th century irish novels that arent exactly crime novels hugo hamiltons headbanger and sad bastard featuring a cop and a noir atmosphere as well as considerable black comedy and seamus smyths quinn featuring a career criminal and a lot of even blacker comedy
637113 ireland had a deep passionate resistance to bringing its problems out in the open maybe because of centuries of living under british rule this country had an intense culture of secrecy whatever you say say nothing anything shameful or dangerous belonged tightly under wraps unmentioned to write about a murder even a fictional one would have gone very strongly against the grain that mentality comes through even in one of the few pieces of irish crime writing i can think of from before about 1990 john b keanes powerful play the field in which a couple of local men kill an outsider for trying to buy a field that they feel belongs to them and the community covers up the murder even the absence of crime writing can tell you a lot about a place

637115 a five thousand lire phone card was used for the call
637116 i have to mention as well that giuttari evidently persecuted a pair of journalists with an alternate view of a real case that is part of his plot in his first novel a florentine death jailing one and kicking the other out of the country for the crime of contradicting the cops theory of the monster of florence case in both his police work and his own book on the case

637140 diagnosis of hiv can occur years after infection the fact that 56 000 americans each year are contracting hiv for the first time is a wake up call for all of us in the u s

637148 if people decide they dont like someone they usually know within 30 seconds
637149 if you meet someone you like three minutes isnt long enough if you dont like them 30 seconds is too long
637150 if you see someone you like in real life you dont go up to them with your resume and compare you just talk

637153 eight to 10 percent of our users have been to real dating sites
637154 were more about meeting new friends not necessarily meeting new dates
637155 the dating stories are good to hear and weve got plenty of them
637156 what interest me are the stories that are unique to our platform where weve come up with a new way for people to extend their social network
637157 the risks associated with allowing this cross bred cat into the country when we already have up to 12 million feral cats wreaking havoc on native fauna are simply too great

637160 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while
637161 this puts a key part of the dashboard in place
637162 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic
637163 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history
637164 evidence of a failure by government and society to do what it takes to control the epidemic
637165 we have been inadequately funding this epidemic all along we need to step it up
637166 de muziekwereld verandert razendsnel zodat het maar goed is dat de veronica top 1000 allertijden al vijf jaar een vaste waarde is met muziek die nauwelijks onderhevig is aan hypes trends en rages platen die hun eeuwigheidswaarde elk jaar weer opnieuw bewijzen in de veronica top 1000 allertijden maar niet alleen de vertrouwde popklassiekers staan er in ook platen die nog maar relatief jong zijn en die aan een echte opmars bezig zijn rood van marco borsato bijvoorbeeld dat nu al bij de bovenste vijftig staat of clocks van coldplay dat niet onderdoet voor een 80s of en het is natuurlijk bijzonder om te zien dat one van u2 de overheersing van stairway to heaven november rain en bohemian rhapsody heeft doorbroken met een verrassende nummer 1 plek
637167 people are working today because they simply dont have enough income to retire its as simple as that
637168 they are panicking and looking at their savings and not seeing that that would get them through
637169 its really difficult at this time to pinpoint any correlation between the downturn in the economy and whether that affects people to work past retirement there could be a lot of reasons why people do what they do after retirement age

637183 your attitude should be the same as that of christ jesus who being in very nature god did not consider equality with god something to be grasped but made himself nothing taking the very nature of a servant being made in human likeness and being found in appearance as a man he humbled himself and became obedient to death even death on a cross

637194 for those of you that are not familiar with connollys work he manages to show both the darkest aspects of man as well as the finest points of humanity in a style that is graphic yet often poetic i can honestly say i think he is one of the finest fiction writers alive today and should be read by all
637195 is it my imagination or do american reviewers seem to give an awful lot of the plot away sheesh leave something for the readers to find out themselves check out this review in the ny times i have a problem with reviewers in general going into the minutiae of the plot it kinda ruins elements of the story
637196 welshs readers will recognise his trademark melange of registers from high flown lyricism through foul mouthed demotic to bland therapy speak the taut dialogue buzzes with snappy ventriloquism welsh is one of our most interesting writers on the minutiae of human consciousness and little happens here that the reader does not end up feeling vividly for himself
637197 if you were putting together a template for what might be the best city for a crime novel i think edinburgh might fit the bill its got that schizophrenic heart there is rich edinburgh and poor edinburgh there are ornate buildings and sink estates inevitably these two worlds must collide which creates perfect conflict for the crime novelist its the city of trainspotting but its also the city of miss jean brodie

637211 i started thinking about what it means to be in active competition with kids overseas i realized i had to set myself apart
637212 so on thursday i had to skip my workout and just so happened to make it home to catch the last 30 minutes of oprah
637213 i felt a sudden pang of panic and just having bought a 1 865 sq foot home complete with a separate 20 x 20 storage building which is currently 50 occupied by stuff i could not yet part with would i be this woman in 30 years i took issue with oprah calling this woman a hoarder a hoarder is a discriminating collector of items to buy 1 2 3 or 10 of in all possible colors flavors and sizes think warmack and his doll oops i mean monster collection a pack rat lacks this ability to discern the important items from the mundane and ends up keeping everything for no apparent rationale oprah show lady clearly falls into this category at the opposite spectrum is the purger who retains items only for their utilitarian or aesthetic value to deflect the squirmy feeling of self recognition in jesss tale i proposed to the group the question are you a hoarder pack rat or purger
637214 ok so now im coming from almost the other side the side of the purger well actually im a forced purger after all ive moved every year since high school after the first move i decided that there was no point in moving a lot of stuff just to have it sit in a box and wait to be moved again so now im faced with a new dilemma how do a purger and a pack rat get along especially in the same house also does your family affect what tendency you lean toward
637215 im not really sure what i am i guess the best time to catch me is when i am moving you truly find out just how much stuff you have when you have to box it up and move it when i move i am always trying to get rid of stuff just for the sake of not having to move it some might call this a philanthropical purger with an ulterior motive like the time that jess knew a lady whose house had just burned down i donated a full six place setting of formal dishes with cloth napkins and napkin rings to match so anytime you hear of me moving it might benefit you to stick around
637216 how do you know what you really are im probably a combination of both some things are well organized while other items are in disarray since this is such a deep dinner conversation this is worthy of a blog post
637217 as i was listening to this conversation i couldnt help but ask myself the same question i seriously have no clue what i am eden asks how your family affects what tendency you lean toward if thats the case im doomed to be a pack rat because thats what my parents are i can already notice the effects as i see myself beginning to collect all of these things that i just dont need so i aspire for more oh that i could be the philanthropical purger that amanda is i go into my closet and clean it out gathering up a whole bag full of clothes to donate to goodwill they sit in my car for over a month sigh so i press on still aspiring for more what about you do you know what you are are you a hoarder a purger do you have a lot of stuff or are you a utilitarian minimalist

637529 and thus it is unrecognizability the absolute unrecognizability when one is god then to be an individual human being but the modern age has abolished christ has either thrown him out completely and taken his teaching or has made him fantastical and has fantastically imputed to him direct communication not so in the situation of contemporaneity remember too that christ wanted to be the sign of contradiction but these eighteen hundred years what supposedly has been learned from them and on the other hand the total ignorance and inexperience of most people with regard to what it means to want to be incognito and ignorance and inexperience due to the rampant didactizing whereas what it means to exist is completely forgotten this has confused the conception of god man the majority of people living in christendom today no doubt live in the illusion that if they had been contemporary with christ they would have recognized him immediately despite his unrecognizability

637533 on a relative basis an argument can be made that they are undervalued relative to other segments of the market and as a result capital is migrating in that direction
637534 our models designed to forecast the value growth expected return have been signaling for the last two years that a reversion was forthcoming and that growth factors should continue to be favored
637535 small cap stocks are most undervalued on simply forward 12 month expected operating earnings now
637536 we expect to observe fairly robust stock market returns over the next three to four months as the coiled spring of fear releases
637537 the market will most likely continue to exhibit huge mood swings based upon the day to day perception of the big issue hanging over the market credit housing and energy
637538 the beginning of the first quarter will be dependent on the christmas season results which i predict will be moderately strong however the markets attention will quickly return to the big three issues and as a result we can expect a sideways market for the first quarter
637539 leading economic indicators as well as the ratio of coincident to lagging economic indicators are both in territories that have only produced recessions historically
637540 high energy prices a credit crunch housings depression are all significant drags on the consumer while tightening lending standards are impacting business capital spending its no longer a positive offset to weak consumption
637541 despite the housing cycle and credit turmoil labor markets remain relatively healthy particularly for a decelerating economy
637542 the u s economy while growing below trend is resilient and expanding aided by strong global growth we expect damage from the credit market turmoil to be limited and fed easing to be very good for stocks
637543 in the 14 easing cycles since 1954 the s amp p 500 was higher one year later in all but one instance the exception was in 2001 because of the september 11th terrorist attacks

637555 hij zou achter hen moeten lopen als een dienaar die achter zijn meester loopt
637556 ik heb in vele boeken gelezen dat het niet passend is voor de zoon of dochter om te spreken in het bijzijn van de ouders behalve met hun toestemming of om voor hen links of rechts van hen te lopen behalve als zij hem roepen om naast hen te lopen hij zou achter hen moeten als een slaaf die achter zijn meester loopt
637557 eenieder die vijf maal per dag dua voor zijn ouders verricht heeft hun rechten vervult omdat allaah zegt
637558 het laten van de dua voor de ouders resulteert in een strak en beperkt leven voor de zoon of dochter
637559 er is geen gelovige die twee ouders heeft die wakker word terwijl hij goed voor hen is behalve dat allaah twee poorten naar het paradijs voor hem opent
637560 ja zelfs wanneer dat het geval is en hij word niet wakker terwijl hij slecht voor ze is behalve dat allaah twee poorten naar de hel voor hem opent
637561 als allaah de verhevene de positie van de ouders niet zou hebben genoemt in zijn boek en ons niet zou hebben aangemaant daarover dan zou het alleen door logica al begrepen worden dus is het een verplichting voor eenieder met logica en intelligentie om zich bewust te zijn van hun positie en hun rechten te volbrengen hoe is het dan als allaah de verhevene dit heeft genoemt in al zijn boeken de thorah de gospel de psalmen en de quran hij heeft dit geboden in al zijn boeken geopenbaard aan al zijn profeten en heeft hen geadviseerd over de eervolle positie van de ouders en het vervolmaken van hun rechten en dat zijn tevredenheid afhankelijk is van hun tevredenheid en zijn woede afhankelijk is van hun woede
637562 mijn voeten zijn niet op het pad van allah bedekt geraakt met stof
637563 iemand wiens voeten bedekt raken met stof op het pad van allaah jihaad zal niet geraakt worden door het hellevuur
637564 vervloekt is degene die denkt dat hij iemand belangrijks is door zijn rijkdom en degene die denkt dat niets is door zijn armoede
637565 de armen hebben voor drie zaken gekozen en de rijken hebben voor drie zaken gekozen de armen hebben gekozen voor een ontspannen ziel een ruim hart en een lichte rekening op de dag des oordeels de rijken hebben gekozen voor een vermoeide ziel een hart dat constant druk is en een zware afrekening
637566 toen allaah de verhevene adam en hawaa eva uit het paradijs had verbannen en zij voor het eerst de geur van de dunya roken nadat de geur van het paradijs van hen ontnomen werd zij veertig dagen lang overweldigd waren door de stank van de dunya
637567 de dunya op de dag des oordeels genomen zal worden en in de hel word gegooit waarna zij zal zeggen o heer waar zijn mijn volgelingen en metgezellen dus worden zij achter haar aan in de hel gegooit
637568 mijn voeten zijn niet op het pad van allah bedekt geraakt met stof
637569 wat vreemd is de situatie van onze broeders in iraaq ze noemen al hajjaaj een moemien
637570 abu bakr heeft aan ons overgeleverd op gezag van ibn iyaash op gezag van al adjlah op gezag van ashabi dat hij zei
637571 ik getuig dat hij een gelovige is in de taghoet en een ongelovige in allah hij bedoelde al hajjaaj
637572 waaki heeft aan ons overgeleverd op gezag van sufyan op gezag van mansoor op gezag van ibraheem dat hij zei
637573 het is genoeg voor iemand om te twijfelen over situatie van al hajjaaj lahaahoe allah een dua om hem te doen vernietigen
637574 snellen naar het doen van daden voor je gezondheid en jeugd verdwijnen
637575 wij werden in de begindagen van al islaam vermaant met de volgende woorden o zoon van adam handel tijdens uw vrije tijd voor u bezig wordt en tijdens uw jeugd voor uw ouderdom en tijdens uw gezondheid voor uw ziekte en tijdens uw verblijf in deze wereld voor het hiernamaals en tijdens uw leven voor uw dood
637576 grijp je kans vandaag en wacht niet op morgen aangezien er niemand is die jou morgen kan garanderen
637577 o dawud u kent de verwantschap tussen ons adviseer mij dus
637578 o mijn broeder inderdaad de nacht en dag zijn stadiums waar mensen doorheen gaan stadium voor stadium totdat zij het einde van hun reis bereiken als je dus voor elke dag van elk stadium wat provisie aan de kant kunt leggen doe dit dan en volbreng hetgeen je kunt voor deze zaak want het lijkt erop dat het einde ervan je bij verassing zal vangen ik ken niemand die verspillender is in deze zaak dan ik ben hij stond toen op en vertrok
637579 wanneer iemand zijn huis binnentreedt en allaah de eervolle en verhevene gedenkt tijdens het betreden van zijn woning en tijdens het eten dan zegt sjaitaan
637580 wanneer je de haan hoort kraaien vraag dan van allaahs gunsten want het heeft een engel gezien en wanneer je de ezel hoort balken zoek dan toevlucht bij allaah van de duivel want het heeft een duivel gezien
637581 leg je hand op het deel van je lichaam dat pijn doet en zeg bismillah drie maal zeg vervolgens zeven maal aoodhu billahi wa qudratihi min sharri maa ajidu wa uhadhir
637582 zit jij nog steeds zo sinds ik jou verlaten heb
637583 ik heb vier zaken drie keer gezegd nadat ik jou verlaten heb mochten zij worden opgewogen tegen hetgeen jij sinds de ochtend gezegd hebt dan zouden zij zwaarder wegen
637584 allaah luistert niet naar een profeet zoals hij luistert naar een profeet die de quran reciteert met een luide en plezante toon
637585 lees de quran want het zal op de dag der opstanding komen als een bemiddelaar voor zijn aanhangers
637586 ik zou liever een man aanvallen met een pijl dan met mijn tong want het is mogelijk dat de pijl zijn doel mist maar de tong mist zijn doel nooit
637587 de gelovige spreekt weinig maar doet veel terwijl de hypocriet veel zegt en weinig doet

637616 from the start we were struck by the excellence and transparency of the sound produced by all of the modules while the sound quality is undoubtedly due at least in part to the 64 bit processing within each module its also a credit to the overall design including the multiband processing and the analog modeling
637617 at such a low price you might be thinking that ozone is more of a toy than a serious tool think again ozone can go head to head with any of the other higher priced products on the market its sound quality is superb and its features provide the flexibility needed to make a final mix sound magical
637618 a remarkable piece of software that for under 200 provides an exceptionally elegant and great sounding toolbox for all the mastering requirements that any one in a project studio could require highly recommended
637619 after having been an engineer for more than 25 years of my life its rare that a product comes along that just blows me away the izotope ozone is just that a mind blowing product not only is it the sexiest app ive ever seen it actually sounds incredible
637620 a layer of ozone might be just what you need to help put a little life into your mixes
637621 it can easily sound as good as the waves c4 and with the other modules that are not included in that processor ozone can sound much better comparing it to something like t racks is close as it can be setup in a similar manner but ozone is smoother and cleaner
637622 hits a high mark for graphic beauty sound quality and flexibility its definitely a best buy
637623 your loudness maximizer sounds better than anything ive heard especially in the guitars department
637624 ozone really takes mastering to a whole new level of capability and quality sure it has a great interface but its the sound quality that sets it apart including the best sounding software eq that i have ever heard
637625 the fact that all your 64 bit calculations are integrated within ozones framework really makes a difference to your sound
637626 i believe that you just built the new holy grail of mastering plug ins the sound quality is equal to products costing 5 times as much and the visual meters and ui are unmatched
637627 the loudness maximizer is very smooth i love the sound of the stereo imaging and the harmonic exciter is something i can really make use of very very nice job
637628 got it and used it for the first time tonight not sure its because of your tool yet but this is the first time ive created my own mix that i like both low and high volumes very cool tool indeed
637629 ozone is very impressive its what ive been looking for a very long time to put that final touch on my recording projects
637630 i m going to be using this on my new cd very clean and sweet gui layout
637631 ozone blew my mind the first time i heard it a must have for mastering
637632 my mixes are big rich and smooth with the quality you would expect from an expensive analog digital mastering house
637633 what a great tool six on the fly arrangable mastering processors and a very compact and usable user interface the sound is as good as the user interface is compact i especially like the mastering reverb it adds dimension of space without smearing or muddying it up simplicity of use but extremely powerful
637634 for those looking for a really great mastering plug in i definitely recommend taking a look at ozone
637635 its good to go out there knowing you are up against these good players as i love a challenge
637636 im always willing to face a challenge head on and a lot of the time ive been successful at it because of my decision making and playing good golf someone has to win the tournament and why cant it be me but ive got to take one step at a time
637637 the tournament isnt over but ill always look back on this day as the first time that ive been leader after the third day i went out and played some solid golf okay i missed some putts but i played really nice today i was calm on the course and i picked my shots and im still leading
637638 it was a difficult day but i started poorly and was three over par after five and it was always going to be a struggle to shoot a really good round from there
637639 overall i am reasonably happy because at least i didnt shoot myself out of it and i am only going to be three shots behind going into the last day after the start i had i have to say that i am pleased enough with the way i finished
637640 armani jeans expresses my vision of a young independent casual lifestyle with a strong and cool fashion sensibility
637641 solange epitomises this style perfectly and brings to it that swing so evident in her new single i decided
637642 im just guessing but someone must have said to her you better get your act together or else
637643 she was perfect and shes a really good actress im not just saying that because of the movie but she really happens to be talented and it looks like shes ok now
637644 getting into the champions league is not going to be easy
637645 to break into that quartet is tough but a number of quality players have come in and well be doing our best to get amongst it
637646 we think around 68 people have died and many are injured
637647 so tactically we took the benefit of the anti tb feeling but strategically we ended up accepting our opponents propaganda and appearing incapable of articulating a forward policy agenda
637648 there are some more circuits coming up that should suit our car though and i trust the team that we will improve otherwise i would have not signed for 2009
637649 i dont regret anything that would not help me instead i always look forward and try to make my decisions work you have to have patience and show the best you can with the car you have
637650 i am sure my time will come next year there are completely new regulations and we could be at the front

637658 it was a very physical game against cameroon and maybe my players were still a bit naive about what to expect at international level now they know what to expect progress has been made and we expect to go to tianjin and polish the things that we need to this week
637659 i think anyone who plays us in the olympics is going to have problems
637660 weve been practising for this tournament for a long time it feels like the culmination of something

637678 i am so happy my son is a big success he works for microsoft and makes a lot of money he is so succesful he just bought his girlfriend a new car
637679 same here my son is so successful too he works for a car dealership and makes a lot of money too he even makes so much money he just bought his girlfriend a new house
637680 i know what you are talking about my son is like that too only he just gave his girlfriend 1 million dollars
637681 i cant believe it i dont know what went wrong my son is a failure hes a janitor listen to this hes even gay the only good part about it is that his boyfriends just got him a new house a new car and gave him a million dollars
637682 ive had some meaningful innings in my life but with the whole situation and for the people back home its bigger than just us this victory id have to say its my best innings
637683 weve all just witnessed a very very special innings the way graeme smith came out and played was as good as ive seen anyone chase down that sort of target under that sort of pressure
637684 i knew we just needed one or two partnership i was focusing on ten runs at a time thinking lets just get close
637685 i felt we were just one wicket away if we could have got the likes of morne morkel and paul harris in on that kind of deck i felt we could have won the game
637686 theyve played better cricket than us over the three games
637687 we think around 68 people have died and many are injured
637688 they were returning from the summit when an avalanche at the bottleneck hit them

637693 in fact i said nothing about violence in the developing world per se all my comments were made in the context of the pervasive nature of violence against women all around the world
637694 the only area i singled out was our own context citing the recent spate of murders in the new york area of women and sometimes their children also by husbands or boyfriends but of course those comments were not quoted
637695 we have 700 men here do you think any of them beat their wives chances are they do the most devout christians beat their wives
637696 culturally many of our bishops come from places where it is culturally accepted to beat your wife in that regard it makes the conversation quite difficult
637697 places where it is culturally accepted to beat your wife
637698 it exists and it goes largely unreported and invisible one of the things that has to happen is that bishops have to give this issue some heat and light not only the violence that happens in the home against women but violence that happens as a weapon of war which is particularly egregious
637699 while domestic violence is often hidden in the home violence against women as an act of war is not hidden and we become complicit when we do not do something about that as a world community and as christians and as an anglican communion
637700 couldnt have killed the woman he was accused of killing because he was too
637701 im just planning on going to fork union keeping my head straight getting my work done and getting to kentucky next year in 2009
637702 a lot of schools backed away and kentucky made me feel wanted they proved themselves to me
637703 we just hope he gets back to the point where hes able to play again because thats the third surgery on that knee
637704 im hoping hes healthy because we need some depth at that position
637705 i cant wait to get the pads on him and see him block
637706 hes been jumping off the charts in workouts as far as speed and strength goes
637707 if you dont think you can do it you shouldnt be here thats for sure
637708 you have to believe in yourself first of all it was a fun situation to be in and im happy i got the opportunity
637709 these two guys have brought a big time level of energy
637710 right now just by having a lot of guys like that you just expect that type of energy and why not these guys are the youngest team in the big leagues right now and we shouldnt be lacking any type of energy
637711 its hard to piece the full picture together what was happening on the site and who had authority to do something
637712 theres no one person who knows the whole scope of the story
637713 construction debris goes into a specific kind of landfill we dont do landfill permitting at all
637714 thats a lie unless you mean a few concrete blocks and those get broken up
637715 we will have to begin doing inspections on a much higher quality level than we have in the past
637716 my site has taken 75 percent of fill from most excavating projects in fayette county

637719 when i read stories regarding how the american health service is i am just so thankful we have the national health service i really do believe we do not pay our nurses or staff anywhere near enough money
637720 look at the list of the eleven names attached to the report there is only one gp the rest are academic or administrative hospital doctors and managers not a single representative of the royal college of nursing no psychiatrist no physiotherapist no one who can advise darzi about what is really going on this is not a consensus report this is unadulterated darzi

637778 any time you engage in negative campaigning you always run the risk of it backfiring on your own campaign
637779 that said people remember negative ads candidates use them because they are effective
637780 if they can capitalize on pre existing fears the electorate has about obama or hesitations they have about him it can be an effective strategy
637781 senator obama is an impressive orator and its a lucky thing for me that people arent just choosing a motivational speaker
637782 washington is full of talented talkers and senator obama is one of the best to come along in quite a while unfortunately on issues big and small what he says and what he does are often two different things
637783 it seems to me the only thing he wants us to do is inflate tires
637784 what john mccain has done in the last week has really shown the american people he doesnt want to talk about the economy or foreign policy or healthcare

637792 the reality shows that traitor lee myung bak is driving the frozen inter korean relations to a catastrophic phase
637793 the government thinks it regrettable that north korea has taken an unreasonable action without complying with a fact finding probe needed to resolve the case
637794 inevitable for strained inter korean ties to continue for a while
637795 but the north unveils its veiled hope to continue the tour business by saying it will expel unnecessary staff not all from kumgang

637863 parsi resource group has been organizing motorcycle drive for the last two years and its a good way of getting the community together and passing the message of peace this time all the people who drove cars and did not have a motorcycle were feeling left out so we decided to have a drive and not just a motorcycle drive had we conducted this rally inside the mumbai city it would have been too congested and hence we decided to take the drive to lonavala and come back it is just the way of passing the message of peace on a friendship day
637864 its parsi community a small community as you know this rally is for a good cause of propagating friendship among all the parsis people so we will make more friends as we go along and we hope to have a good time

637883 my house has been flooded with water though the water has cleared a bit the garbage is still left behind there is no food to feed the children we are facing a lot of trouble there are a lot of mosquitoes as well which trouble us a lot then the fear of snakes also does not let us sleep in peace we have no means to medicine and also our provisions have been washed away in the floods
637884 there is water everywhere we are facing a lot of problem five six people have also been bitten by snake and are in a critical condition all our belongings have been washed away in the floodwaters the government is not coming to our aid and is not helping us in any way
637885 we are providing immediate relief to the villagers we are supplying them with food our medical teams are also regularly patrolling the areas to keep a check on the villagers as there is a fear of outbreak of diseases
637886 i see children carrying paper and plastic flags and throwing them on road which is an insult to our national flag so i thought of making a dupatta and introducing it in the market i have also got an order from vishal bharat sansthan to prepare over 100 pieces this can satisfy my patriotism and reduce our miseries too
637887 its a matter of pride this muslim family has proved how much keen they are to see the national flag is respected by all through this they are spreading their patriotism and secondly they are fulfilling their daily necessities
637888 this is creating awareness among muslim families and they are becoming a part of it this type of business involves three families the one who weaves the other one dyes and the third family stitches their work teams up employment with the spirit of nationalism for these families this will help strengthen the country and will spread all over
637889 weve got theories weve been talking to police and experts in all different fields family spokesman glenn tunstead told abc radio last week
637890 the difficulty is every theory ends up in a dead end or a point where it becomes ridiculous and theres no sort of factual information to back up you know to make that theory have any substance and thats the difficulty of the whole thing
637891 the family are still doing things very tough a day doesnt go by where its not spoken about and looked at he said
637892 were hoping that the inquest will drive out that information that the authorities have got or the possibility that other people that havent come forward yet will come forward with something that we can use

637900 im really grateful that acting is the job that was chosen for me
637901 i get really lost when im not working i dont know what im supposed to do with myself thank god for dance class and the new york times crossword puzzle and american idol but acting is what i really have to do
637902 adoration by priests how fine i will pray for father eymards work every day
637903 whats so fantastic is that we found them completely furnished with beds chairs tables communication systems and the personal effects of the soldiers who lived inside
637904 emptied by the danes of their contents after world war ii to salvage the scrap iron and electrical devices that were needed
637905 it was like entering the heart of a pyramid with mummies all around i dug a tunnel through the sand that was blocking the entrance to the bunkers and what i saw blew me away it was as if the german soldiers had left only yesterday
637906 it was a race against the clock because of the risk of looters we lied to keep them at bay saying that there was only one furnished bunker and that it was guarded around the clock which wasnt true but even so there were two attempted break ins
637907 it was surprising to see the soldiers living conditions in the bunkers
637908 in a way this discovery can be compared to tutankhamuns tomb almost a century ago it has to be preserved and to blow up the bunkers as some have suggested would be like denying that world war ii ever existed
637909 disgusted that people want to attract tourists to this kind of garbage
637910 was not from the bronze age what has been found is incredibly authentic and tells us a lot about how they lived in these bunkers
637911 we dont expect contemporary objects like these to be so well preserved maybe its because they were kept for 60 years in the cold and dark like in a big vacuum
637912 world war ii and its memories will not just go away and discoveries like these breathe new life into the story and the fascination that still surrounds this war
637913 the same way as waste vapour is drawn out of this material to make hikers more comfortable to less prone to hypothermia so it is able to breathe oxygen into our fuel cell and into contact with the conductive plastic
637914 the benefits for the motoring industry and for motorists are that the new design removes the need for platinum which acts as the catalyst and is currently central to the manufacturing process
637915 our reliance on platinum is making the likelihood of using fuel cells in everyday passenger cars increasingly improbable
637916 the cost of the platinum component alone of current fuel cells for a small car with a 100kw electric engine is more than the total cost of an 100kw gasoline engine also current annual world production of platinum is only sufficient for about 3 million 100kw vehicles less than one twentieth of the current annual global production of vehicles
637917 the small amounts of carbon monoxide that are always present in exhausts from petrol engines are a real problem for fuel cells because the platinum catalyst is slowly poisoned eventually destroying the cell
637918 the important point to stress is that the team has come up with an alternative fuel cell design that is more economical more easily sourced outlasts platinum cells and is just as effective
637919 fuel leaks are one of the most widespread forms of contamination in australia and elsewhere

637921 you just add the bacteria to btex contaminated water and they go straight to work
637922 the reason is that no two contaminated sites are the same the soils the groundwater the temperature the mix of contaminants are always different we want to see how the bugs perform in as wide a range of conditions as possible
637923 we have proved that this technology works in the laboratory we know the bugs can be used to detect and break down btex efficiently we now want to take them to the next stage and develop the technology for practical application in industry or any urban setting
637924 our research however shows that this may not be possible for all corals
637925 this study is one of few that follows individual colonies over a two year period and shows that individual colonies of the stony coral stylophora pistillata do not change their symbionts as a response to temperature stress
637926 the sensitivity to bleaching conditions and survival appears tightly linked with fine scale differences in the genetic identity of the zooxanthellae that were present within the coral colonies
637927 because corals with sensitive zooxanthellae suffer high mortality after bleaching we see a shift in the symbiont community towards more tolerant types
637928 the important message here is that this shift is not due to the uptake of different symbionts by individual colonies but by differential mortality between sensitive and tolerant colonies
637929 the result is a decrease in diversity of both the coral host and their symbionts
637930 the reduced diversity will have a negative effect on reef resilience since it makes the ecosystem more vulnerable to fluctuations in other environmental factors
637931 this is worrying since coral reefs are likely to face a suite of stressors in the future

637938 they are trying to prolong everything i think the russians are interested in keeping the status quo
637939 the russians are afraid that the internationalization process has started the russians want to conduct negotiations in a way that they are the main players they will reject everything in which they do not play the main role and i think they have told the abkhaz reject everything in which russia is not playing a leading role

637987 it happened purely by accident in the first instance we were monitoring leopards in germany to try and understand their territorial patterns of hunting and mating when one of our team johan yo han noticed something quite peculiar when he was looking through some photos of leopards in our purpose built hide he returned to the teams very comfortable dormitory rather excited and animated and proclaimed to us that the leopards seemed unable to change their spots
637988 that right away we did not take johans wild claims very seriously so we tied him naked to the roof of the adjoining refrigeration plant we had however been drinking quite heavily but in the morning we realised he really was on to something and we began to throw ideas around which is when we came up with the idea of testing johans very same theory with humans
637989 it was then that it became clear to us that johan had been on to something
637990 regrettably it was four days before we were sober up enough to remember the whole tying onto the roof naked thing

638121 very important that the fbi present their case against bruce and not just state that the investigation was over because it was him and hes gone
638122 im concerned about what closing this case without conclusive evidence might do to harm our life sciences enterprise i think we as americans need to see the proof
638123 its a shame the man is not here with us we might have known more
638124 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure

638283 there shall be a president of the university who shall be appointed by the board in consultation with the senate and with the approval of the lieutenant governor in council

638285 its a little bit ironic for a progressive conservative to be harkening back to smallwoodian legislation
638286 neither she or the board are covering themselves with glory and neither are following the act the clear intent of the act is to return the appointment of the president to the university

638320 we expect growth in industrial production to accelerate to 10 per cent in 2008 09 compared to the 8 3 per cent growth recorded in 2007 08
638321 the recent trends reflected in the index of industrial production iip have raised anxieties of a slowdown in industrial activity
638322 we believe that industrial growth has slowed because of capacity constraints and inflation is high because demand is high
638323 the industry is creating fresh capacities at an aggressive pace and as these new capacities get commissioned supplies would increase to meet the soaring demand as a result we believe that the current slowdown seen in the iip numbers is a short term phenomenon that would be reversed by the middle of 2008 09

638349 while the mls is anxious to expand west a team in baltimore would only add to a regional rivalry with washington philly and new york

638354 were trying to attract more people to the area who are conscious of quality
638355 the more reputable businesses that come to the area the better the area will be

638358 ive heard from people that the streets are cleaner it seems safer at night because there seems to be more good activity in the evenings people are walking around

638360 it really seems that a lot of merchants are coming in a lot of new businesses
638361 the problem with gentrification is that it just changes one economic strata for another but the gentrification here isnt changing the strata its just filling the houses
638362 what i like about our neighborhood is its never going to be snooty there arent huge brownstones were always going to be a neighborhood
638363 we would like to see all of these really historical beautiful buildings highlighted
638364 a clue that were really moving forward this is a clue that people are engaged
638365 its an incredible shot in the arm to see this many people energized and committed
638366 these people are prepared to take care of their own community and what you really need is communities taking care of communities
638367 we knew who they were checking on and thats all we needed to know
638368 ever since theyve teased me at the museum that i helped the fbi solve the case
638369 they mostly asked a lot of questions we couldnt answer
638370 they wanted to know if they could have a look around i said yes but they never did
638371 it didnt surprise me that he became a world renowned scientist
638372 i assume they were down here looking for documents and checking the walls to make sure they werent hollow
638373 the secret of happiness is freedom the secret of freedom is courage

638376 this summer is the first summer we didnt have a vacation bible school
638377 everything was old growth wood massive arches it was an amazing structure you dont see structures built like this very often even from this time period
638378 so many of our churches in hampden have gone into private hands
638379 you know that a developer would love to get hold of this i just cant imagine what were going to do now
638380 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
638381 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
638382 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
638383 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
638384 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
638385 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
638386 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
638387 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
638388 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
638389 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
638390 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
638391 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
638392 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

638428 drug disasters are literally built into the current system of drug testing and approvals in the united states
638429 recent changes in the system have only increased the proportion of new drugs with serious risks
638430 based on our current system the designation of safe and effective on todays new drugs could be replaced with apparently safe based on incomplete information and more effective than a placebo
638431 speed up reviews for safety have more than tripled the number of black box warnings of side effects or withdrawals after drugs are on the market
638432 despite recent reforms to strengthen the fdas role in protecting the public from harmful drugs the harm benefit ratio is worsening due to these reviews and relaxed rules that allow companies to promote drugs for unapproved uses
638433 an opportunity to make a change for good both for palestinians and israelis we intend to open the port fish with the fishermen help in the clinics and work in the schools but we also intend to remind the world that we will not stand by and watch 1 5 million people suffer death by starvation and disease

638444 we would give 100 per cent support to anwar wherever he may contest to ensure that he could take his rightful place in parliament
638445 this will enable me to play a role in facilitating the transition of power
638446 we practise democracy in umno if they want to speak we cant stop them or they will say we are being dictatorial
638447 because pkr fights for equality among the races when anwar becomes prime minister then everyone will be treated equally regardless of whether they are malay chinese indian kadazan

638461 as per our information 30 children and 38 women have been killed
638462 snakes may be prevented by natural selection from becoming too small because below a certain size there may be nothing for their young to eat
638463 if a tiny snake were to have two offspring each egg could occupy only half the space that is devoted to reproduction within its body
638464 but then each of the two hatchlings would be half the normal size perhaps too small to function as a snake or in the environment
638465 the fact that tiny snakes produce only one massive egg relative to the size of the mother suggests that natural selection is trying to keep the size of hatchlings above a critical limit in order to survive
638466 well who could have took it will you help me look for it
638467 sure uncle moose but i didnt see anyone take it
638468 as the sands of time slip thru the hourglass so do the days of our lives

638488 this is a very serious and difficult and emotional challenge
638489 the reason fremont is dealing with it and other cities are going to and the state is dealing with it is because the federal government has failed to address this issue
638490 pure and simple they ve got to secure our borders they ve got to decide what they re going to do with the 12 or 13 million illegals that are here right now and then we need to find a more efficient effective and speedier way for legal immigration
638491 we re going to deal with it again at the state level this session
638492 they have to resolve the energy issue and the fiscal crisis that we have at the federal level i would argue that instead of going on vacation for the month of august that they ought to say there and get something done on all of these issues
638493 it s easy to say secure the border and we re making progress there we can develop a better system for legal immigration
638494 but the challenge they have got to deal with is we have 12 to 14 million illegals here right now you have to decide who s going to be legal and how they will become legal and who isn t quite honestly and i don t mind being perfectly candid they re afraid to do it
638495 we can t have 50 states and thousands of cities doing it differently
638496 it s a tough decision i realize that but make a decision
638497 i ve had a chance to travel all over the world as governor for all the criticism of our great country where do people want to come to places like fremont neb to new york california or wherever it may be because we re the land of opportunity and freedom
638498 but i will also share with you that nebraskans and americans believe in legal immigration not illegal immigration we re compassionate but when someone is here illegally it creates all sorts of problems and challenges for us so we have to solve the issue
638499 we can t have 50 states and thousands of cities doing it differently
638500 it s a tough decision i realize that but make a decision
638501 in the past three year now 155 companies decided to expand or locate here in nebraska
638502 they re going to invest 5 billion in our economy and they are going to create more than 13 500 jobs
638503 what that means very simply is not a single high school graduate or college graduate should have to leave this state now we have the jobs for them right here in nebraska and i can tell them where they re at
638504 we are no longer competing just against iowa missouri and kansas it s india pakistan and china and a whole bunch of other countries
638505 little house on the prairie is a brand that people want and its our responsibility to make sure it lives up to its name

638553 the torch represents peace and harmony the olympic spirit will give us strength to rebuild
638554 theres a lot of glory in having the torch come here this is our way of showing our support
638555 we have had so much sadness buried deep within us
638556 the torch relay will help it all burst from within us and dissipate
638557 there are some groups that are going to be here just because this is a big stage
638558 but i think the majority of groups are here because they really want to demonstrate to the delegates that they want to see some sort of changes in the party platform

638561 i refuse to settle for anything less than all the rights which are due me under the constitution
638562 our grandfather thought frank was a point of connection a bridge if you will to the larger african american experience for my brother
638563 frank was part of a group of black vanguard intellectuals
638564 the people that he came into contact with throughout his life like richard wright and margaret walker were very significant
638565 you could get a lot of strength from a person like frank who had suffered all the discrimination that a black man goes through in america
638566 mccarthy era strategy of smear tactics and condemnation by association
638567 writings of frank marshall davis a voice of the black press
638568 he made his vision into a beacon a light shedding understanding and enlightenment on the problems that denied people regardless of race national origin or economic status their constitutional rights
638569 with his books and whiskey breath and the hint of hard earned knowledge behind the hooded eyes
638570 t he chief function of the child his business in the world during the first six or seven years of his life is to find out all he can about whatever comes under his notice by means of his five senses that he has an insatiable appetite for knowledge got in this way and that therefore the endeavour of his parents should be to put him in the way of making acquaintance freely with nature and natural objects
638571 t he education of habit is successful in so far as it enables the mother to let her children alone not teasing them with perpetual commands and directions a running fire of do and dont but letting them go their own way and grow having first secured that they will go the right way and grow to fruitful purpose
638572 it is important that the balance of the investigation currently in progress by the california attorney general be completed

638576 he was kind of a lost soul it was as if he was always looking for something
638577 he started talking about how they were after me there was nothing there

638579 a little guy with a heart bigger than you could know
638580 timothy richard mclean known as timmy to his friends and tim junior by his family was a stubborn soul and a kind one
638581 he made friends effortlessly disliked no one and accepted everyone for who they were he was a charmer who loved to smile and you could never take a plate of food away from him
638582 the family appreciates all the love and support from friends loved ones and the public nationwide
638583 i would like to thank the cincinnati reds organization for allowing me to fulfill a lifelong dream of playing for my hometown team i will always value the lasting friendships i have with the lindner castellini and williams families
638584 while my nine seasons there were filled with personal highlights like hitting my 400th 500th and 600th home runs in a reds uniform and the negatives of having to fight through too many injuries my biggest regret is that we were not able to win a world championship while i was there
638585 i also would like to thank my many teammates managers coaches and reds employees for their help and support and to acknowledge the many friendly relationships i had with most of the members of the local media i will miss the banter
638586 last but certainly not least i would like to thank reds fans for their support

638603 it doesnt feel as bad as it did when i hurt it i tried to take it easy during the three days i was in louisville on rehab im hoping its more fatigue than pain we just have to be more cautious now the game plan is day by day sometimes you take four or five steps forward one back then you go forward again and it gets better
638604 but i was a little shocked when i saw him chase that ball in the outfield he only had one ball out there the ball in left center i didnt see him limp in batting practice or anything since he got back just in the game which is what i was afraid of
638605 it doesnt have to be one guy and jay is a little young 21 to put that on him anyway

638609 he threw strikes kept the ball down good velocity good sink a couple of good sliders only one walk thats the longest he has gone in quite awhile but he kept his pitch count down

638618 brandon is usually as sure handed as heck there is none better than brandon it shocked us all that opened the gates boy that was a terrible game an ugly game we played
638619 elijah dukes hit the ball hard and it just ate me up
638620 it hit the grass and skipped on me off my wrist i told everybody before fridays game guys youre going to make errors on this field you have to read the ball good off the bat because the field is bouncy and fast
638621 you cant catch em all and you learn from your mistakes
638622 lincoln has been pitching great and the balls got through
638623 he made a real good pitch on austin kearns but he got it through the infield that could have been a double play any one of several could have been a double play but they found the holes

638743 i would say your 46 d sized breasts have roses beat an thats saying something

638746 use that ice freezing stare on someone whos easily intimidated
638747 if you dont tell me what i wish to know
638748 is that supposed to be a threat or a promise or is it just your subtle way of saying how much you longed to see me again

638762 and what did you do when the daleks were invading brax
638763 i was locked in my home and quite happy to be there
638764 soul is an imprecise metaphysical term laced with religious overtones and im not sure the daleks actually have one but i looked into something
638765 you should have gone with the doctor a decade away would do you good
638766 if i leave id never come back and what am i if im not the president
638767 you shall see a doctor one of those new young prydonians i think ill find a discreet easily awed sort
638768 and then we shall go to hmm the southern mountains i think wild country and vast skies you can rest and recover and i shall fill you in on all that youve missed these last two decades
638769 six months i think gallifrey will get by without you for six months
638770 that i would quite like to wipe the daleks out of history
638771 an admirable goal my lady president we shall discuss it at length in the coming months

638785 so i applaud your caution but i assure you there is no question of my identity
638786 youre not the person i wanted to bring back you might or might not be someone useful convince me because otherwise i have no reason to keep you around and every reason to hand you over for a lovely public execution nobody would care who is actually inside that body
638787 shooting me would be one executing me would be one we could be good together i can see that now

638807 the use of sensory bombardment and in particular the pornographic films to attempt to break down this male muslim shows that the uk were doing exactly the same as the us using coercive interrogation techniques developed in the 1960s and especially in northern ireland and then refined to fit the so called war on terror

638858 we wanted to celebrate who we are and what we are about its a festival with an edge were not afraid to bring things out into the open and discuss issues we dont hide away from controversy
638859 we are currently working with people on the shankill to try to get them more involved in the f ile and to support emerging festivals i think that theres clear evidence that people have to move forward in terms of whats good for the community

638893 the course is playing great the pins were a little easier than they were yesterday and the greens were a little softer
638894 the pins were just not as crazy i think the usga kind of listened to some guys and they did a good job with the setup
638895 they started midway through my career so i havent given them the priority like i do a major or care about like a major
638896 but they are always the best fields in the game theyre always on great golf courses theyre always on tough tests so i think theres a lot of merit to whoever wins those

638904 ken got overwhelmed with every single player coming up to him and telling him hello
638905 i think it was great that he came out today a lesser person would not have come out but he did and we cant wait to get him back
638906 i know hes extremely remorseful and he understands but if we want to be a good football team we have to win without him
638907 from what happened in his last start its kind of hard to feel as confident as i was for the derby and those other races
638908 but i feel as confident as i can be that hes going to run his race
638909 im still kind of concerned about whats going to happen sunday because i know the horse went into the belmont in very good condition and whatever happened in that race i have no idea
638910 but if it happens again then im going to know something is wrong with him hes just not going to run anymore stuff like that you know
638911 big brown is the story and rightfully so and we hope our horses come to play and see what happens

638949 current rates of deforestation whether it is here in indonesia or anywhere else in the world are unsustainable and need to be slowed
638950 we want an appreciation of the forest cover that we have because in maintaining it we want to lobby for a compensation for that
638951 the world will benefit very much if the hundreds of millions of forests all over the world not just indonesia will be restored and for that the world will be happy to pay
638952 the meeting is a follow up to the previous meeting between us and the air force chief of staff in jakarta some time ago
638953 we enjoyed the moment but now weve got to move on the important thing for us is that we back this up on friday against southland
638954 we got behind on the scoreboard against canterbury but the boys showed some composure to get in front and then hang on
638955 it was a very special time for all of us out there today it was just unbelievable
638956 wat zou er gebeuren als ik op dit knopje druk
638957 six of the boys were walking into town when three of them decided to get a run on three others dion nick and cooper were left behind and walking in at their own pace
638958 he was looking down at the river saying something to the boys and they told him to get down in a split second he fell
638959 they saw him mr cowdrey three times bobbing up and down in the river they did have contact with him yelling out screaming to him to get to the other side of the river
638960 all of a sudden he just went down and he never came back up
638961 they have no idea what the hells gone on how it could happen and theyre struggling to deal with whats happening theyre out on the water trying to do what they can to help
638962 we never give up hope but he hasnt been found well look every day the condition of the river is a factor and with the amount of water it may affect how soon he is found he may come up a bit sooner
638963 historically if someone is in the river it takes a few days towards a week before we find them
638964 i come to the match not 100 per cent physically or mentally
638965 but its a important match so i still try my best
638966 when you get good athletes like williams theyre going to be good in just about any sport you shove them into and i think he could be good enough in rugby union to one day become an all black
638967 if he puts the work in and stays humble and things went his way with injury and that theres no doubt he could go as far as he wants
638968 if sonny bill plays the game hell probably be playing at 13 or on the wing just to try and get a feel of the game
638969 and to have a bloke like tana who is probably the best in that position in the last two decades you couldnt have a better bloke to try and get you on your feet and running in rugby union
638970 any team that gets him would be rubbing their hands together and really looking forward to playing with him
638971 so sonny bill should steer away from no 8 for me it would be a big no no
638972 its a position you need to grow up playing youre a key linkman at no 8 and you make probably the most crucial decisions on the field with the nine halfback and 10 five eighth
638973 hed make a good no 6 thats a better position to learn the game but if it were over to me id put him in the centres thats his position i reckon
638974 i think it was a surprise to everybody even alinghi
638975 one last roll of the dice you go to the gallows after that one
638976 this is a situation that presents an opportunity for those two guys to put down their weapons and for alinghi to reach out to oracle
638977 but i want to see over the next few weeks what the moves are
638978 right now we dont have a relationship with them and theres been no communication between us and them this year
638979 dunno they could but i dont know i think were a long way from that though its getting a long way down the speculation line
638980 we want to survive and the conditions weve been put in make it difficult for us to survive
638981 there are other teams afloat but not at the level we are and we cant sit like this forever with money going out the door
638982 if this delay continues well have to take further steps to stay viable i couldnt continue to cash burn at the rate im doing and continue to survive but we wont be easily knocked over
638983 it is five thirty it is time to get up

638991 the kppu s ruling will not affect investment as the government has continued to improve the country s investment climate from year to year
638992 so it s not a question whether the government supports the decision of the kppu or not it s more a question of law enforcement so that business competition in indonesia remains sound and proper
638993 in line with our policy of obeying regulations in operating the company pt telkomsel will respect whatever decision is made in a legal process in indonesia including the decision of kppu
638994 basically telkomsel will always abide by existing regulations and law based decisions but for the sake of clarity telkomsel will appeal the kppu decision
638995 what i want to emphasize is the common sense that the indonesian government controls 65 percent of telkomsel in an industry where regulators set prices
638996 so it is absolutely inconceivable that the indonesian government would standby and allow the indonesian consumers to suffer the consequences
638997 based on the legal provision temasek can appeal to the higher court if it objected to the kppu s ruling
638998 whoever wants to do business in indonesia she or he must abide by indonesia s laws they often ask us to abide by their laws and so they must also abide by our laws they should not get angry when they are given sanctions and then they say the investment climate in indonesia is bad
638999 this man is clearly not very well when officers went into his home they found some quite disturbing material that suggested he wanted to kill brian may it was written like a contract to kill him

639011 differences in small animals are much more subtle and so are frequently over looked
639012 the great thing is that dna is as different between two small snakes as it is between two large snakes allowing us to see the differences that we cant see by eye
639013 this is unusual for snakes but seems to be a feature of small animals
639014 if a tiny snake were to have more than one offspring each egg would have to share the same space occupied by the one egg and so the two hatchlings would be half the normal size
639015 i was thrilled when i turned over that rock and found it

639024 which allow for exercise freedom of movement and reduction of stress appropriate to the species
639025 theres going to be plenty of enthusiasm getting over there and that is one thing thats certainly very important in these big games
639026 when you have a loss like this it just about guarantees that youre going to have pretty good performance when the team next goes onto the field
639027 whilst the guys are all going to hurt for the next couple of weeks until we play the next game the next performance will be a big one from us im sure
639028 i think we put too pressure on ourselves in not executing things well right across from the lineout to the breakdown as well
639029 when they the all blacks come with that sort of intensity and we make those sorts of mistakes then it puts them on the front foot and its very hard to recover from that

639058 we develop a product for children who are physically or mentally challenged in some way
639059 to get them to interact with some toys that would not normally be designed for them
639060 a lot of the toys are ones that have a little micro switch where the kids do not have the dexterity to manipulate it
639061 we have it set up so we can go around and look at tables with the products in front of clients
639062 it started as a really nice way to have campers come up with a project idea
639063 every time they clicked it the frog would start dancing
639064 it made me think not to take advantage of the little things you can do
639065 it is being able to interact and treat them like any kid

639071 i wish i was there to stop him but rachels a very strong character and she can handle him
639072 she might get upset but she wont crack as easily as he thinks he may as well give up now
639073 shes a fun loving person and is exactly like she is in her audition video her life outside the house is anything but boring she loves travelling going out with her friends fitness training and raising money for charity
639074 rachel always values her friendships and loves lively bubbly people so her and kat will remain friends shes already asked her to come to wales and meet us
639075 he has to go because of his audition tape who does he think he is saying he was going to nail all the girls
639076 i have no time for men who treat women like that
639077 there are thai guards we do not dare go in as we want to we can enter through one road only and it is guarded on both sides they dont allow us in the wouldnt allow us in they guard the entire area and they issue us a letter to go in to visit when we return back they demand back the letter they issued
639078 i used to visit the place i was told that this is a khmer temple but when i visited it it was the thai who occupied it when i arrived there we saw only thai soldiers surrounding the entire temple they left only one road to go visit they limited the visit time between 7 00 am and 5 00 pm then they told us to leave
639079 during the lon nol regime 1970 1975 i was a soldier and i guarded the temple when the regime changed in the 90s i stopped guarding it and then the thai came in
639080 before i was a self defense soldier and i was guarding the temple there right after the war early 90s they thai came in to occupy it before that they were never there they built road straight into the temple i dont know what to do should we protest or not i am very upset this is our temple but its occupied by the foreigners instead
639081 nowadays i am begging the government and the authority again and again i am asking them to help resolve the ta moan temple issue i am very saddened that our current cambodian children and grandchildren see this temple as belonging to them thai this is ours we lost it completely
639082 to sum it up in the last 2 3 years thailand built a road and came to occupy the temple earlier during the sangkum era sihanouk regime and up to 1993 we moved back into our territory therefore when our troops move back in thailand moved their troops forward to defend their territories when they saw the temple they made the arrangement to occupy it this issue is of high concerns for us but it is an issue that must be dealt by the government
639083 the geography of the ta moan temple is considered as a

639089 for the time being i am still a hamburg player but i expect everything to be resolved quickly and that the two clubs will reach an agreement
639090 it is a dream of mine to play for real madrid and if in the end it happens then i would be delighted i cannot deny that
639091 at the moment i cannot say any more and i do not want to speak about this much out of respect for my current club
639092 i am just staying calm i have to be like that and just wait and see what happens the truth is i am happy
639093 of course it is pleasing to know that a club as great as real madrid are interested in me and it is logical that the journalists are spending a lot of time focussing on this
639094 the first thing i have to do is consider hamburg but everyone knows i would be delighted to go to real madrid but right now i have a club and i am fine
639095 i want the national team of my own country its always been a dream since i was a child my idol is romario and i have grown up with sao paolo in my heart it would be an honour to play in the gold and green dunga was a great player and its now up to him to decide
639096 i think steven is clever enough to do that if he needs to adapt then he will adapt because he is a player of quality who can play in different positions
639097 if we play a 4 4 2 formation then gerrard can play as a midfielder if we play with torres on his own up front then gerrard and keane can play either side of him
639098 i dont think that steven will be frustrated by that
639099 i was reading an interview recently about gerrards role in the england team and he is now very clear about his role in the football world that you need to adapt think about the team and play in different positions when it is required
639100 we havent received any authentic offers for quaresma inter have been informed of the fixed figure release clause giving advance notice of a counter proposal which i have not yet received
639101 he has been fantastic benty will score goals when he plays and im sure he will continue to do so in the premier league
639102 he is a hungry player it was clear from when i came to the club in january and i believe he will do really well this season
639103 even at this increased distance from the final i am more angry
639104 i think the referee blew against us he was partial to say the least
639105 he did not show the spaniards a red card and he did not give us a handball decision
639106 i cant believe that some people were going on about wayne not having had a great season he scored 15 goals and had 15 assists a lot of players would be delighted with that
639107 when you play alongside wazza and watch what he does in games you realise hes a special talent
639108 you just need to look at him running into the left back position and making tackles
639109 he had to take the responsibility of leading the line on his shoulders and he was awesome
639110 he played out of position a lot he played on the left and sacrificed himself so many times for the team
639111 i know the manager wants to see wayne playing in his more accustomed position just off the front
639112 maybe that will happen if we sign a striker and then youll see how dangerous he can be
639113 there is no way except talks and obedience to the law

639170 most of the dead are from the rival sides we have never seen such a heavy fighting since the ethiopian forces entered our country
639171 there was heavy fighting today and the ethiopian forces suffered huge losses many of them were killed and their armed vehicles destroyed
639172 we think around 68 people have died and many are injured
639173 we have made our position abundantly clear to the israelis and indeed to the world not just in our public statements but in our private conversations as well
639174 there is uniformity across the u s government about the way to proceed with iran
639175 everyone from this white house including the vice presidents office is in agreement that the military option is not the best option at this point and we should pursue diplomatic and economic pressures
639176 an american commitment to deterrence especially if seen by israelis as a substitute for prevention is itself likely to spur israel to consider independent action
639177 we have now collected the pieces of nine dead women and still there are other parts scattered
639178 a minibus full of seriously injured women was rushed to hospital and i think the death toll will be more than this only two women who sell tea along the road survived
639179 we received 46 injured including two men most of them serious the two men and two other women died in the emergency room
639180 they were armed to the teeth and wearing military clothing
639181 we were under the impression that they were soldiers carrying out a sweep operation
639182 once theyd got into the house they seized my mobile phone
639183 they ordered us to stay in the kitchen where three of their underlings kept watch over us while they rifled through the whole house
639184 they wanted the money my father had just received under the agricultural aid policy he had been granted 200 000 dinars which the terrorists took they werent happy with that though because they then demanded jewellery from my mother and sisters and a hunting rifle that belonged to my brother once theyd plundered our possessions they ordered us to stay inside the house they threatened to kill any of us who tried to get out
639185 the killing of that person could be part of a retaliation operation for having refused to yield to blackmail
639186 farmers are often targeted by blackmailers through the taxes they seek to levy on farmers traders and people of various professions
639187 the incident may be seen in the context of the terrorist groups attempts to find resources to overcome their funding crisis
639188 if you are neutral in situations of injustice you have chosen the side of the oppressor if an elephant has its foot on the tail of a mouse and you say that you are neutral the mouse will not appreciate your neutrality

639192 there were also bombing incidents in pakistan subsequently but we have not pointed fingers at anyone as we believe in carrying out investigations before laying responsibility
639193 such baseless accusations serve no purpose other than vitiating bilateral atmosphere
639194 it is important that the blame game is avoided as both countries have an institutionalized counter terror mechanism which is functioning satisfactorily
639195 a candid and open conversation between two people who both wanted to see a way forward in this situation
639196 you have to help us tackle the issue of zambian women stranded in mali there are many zambian women who went there with their spouses but they have now been left stranded we have been pursuing this issue with our offices in nigeria but we would be glad if you could help us with information on how many zambians are there and their children and those that want to come back home
639197 your role will be pivotal in establishing close links between both governments and the private sector of our two countries you will be expected to empower both zambian and mauritian people and the business sector with information about the economic opportunities existing in the two countries

639200 the challenge shes taken on is a considerable one and its important to us that challenge is progressing not at the expense of her long term health but also to see how that performance is progressing in terms of her getting towards good shape to be able to perform
639201 theres a lot of people involved in this theres coaches involved theres medics involved you look down you sit down and you say where are we do you feel youre capable of doing yourself justice
639202 when youve got athletes who have got a record of past achievement of past performance theyre not going to put themselves in the line if theyre not in the shape to perform
639203 assembling to march and protest is a citizens right but it must be stressed that when exercising this right citizens must respect and not harm others freedoms and rights and must not harm national social and collective interests

639212 i am no longer the young god of sydney 2000 i am someone in his 30s who has to use his resources sparingly
639213 i know i should be able to get a medal on the 200m freestyle as except for michael phelps i measure up to everyone else
639214 i was told i had more of an aptitude for weightlifting
639215 that was about the last sport i was interested in
639216 for a start its not as strict as gymnastics in gymnastics you cant eat anything here you eat whatever you want
639217 there are girls who are interested in weightlifting its the dads who dont let them they worry that youre going to look like a bull
639218 i tell them that in mexico we have strong women who can excel in this sport so we have this great opportunity
639219 they say yeah sure but let some other fathers daughter do it
639220 i pass by the tables of other athletes in the olympic canteen and i think ooh the gymnasts pretty girls arent they
639221 when something like that happens in your life its just seared into your memory
639222 you live thinking that you were put up for adoption because i burned down my house you blame yourself
639223 i had a very interesting childhood and it has made me a very determined and motivated person
639224 if i do in fact win the gold it will definitely be the icing on the cake
639225 my mom gave me a hug and then walks down the stairs
639226 three people then walked up behind me grabbed me pulled me back into the orphanage
639227 i was like whats going on why is my mom driving away then she came back in three days and i thought we were back together
639228 but instead of giving me a hug she told me to go into this room and play i realised after a few hours she had left again and they were splitting up me and my brother
639229 they were sticklers for education i didnt know how to spell my name i couldnt count read anything i was essentially a blank slate at five years old
639230 they were like if you dont make good grades you cant play sports i spent a lot of my elementary school years staying home studying
639231 i owe a lot of where i am to my adoptive parents i couldnt imagine having a lot of the opportunities today without them
639232 make the most of every day because i am living a dream right now
639233 i get to travel around the world throwing a shot put ball and get paid for it
639234 i have been able to make a life for myself and my wife

639315 we are grateful to the washington post the new york times time magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost 40 years it would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subjected to the lights of publicity during those years but the world is more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government the supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national autodetermination practiced in past centuries

639322 i was on the verge of not wanting to play here any more dealing with the fans and not winning i was like all right ill get through with my contract and ill see what happens but now were on the verge of something special we had a good year last year and this is definitely a football town and its turning back around this is a fun place to play when youre winning

639326 he asked why are the yankees always so good every video game we get theyve got the best team i explained to him that they spend a lot of money on players if a player is really good they try to trade for him usually they have kind of an all star team
639327 about two months later i was signing autographs he said dead serious why would anyone want your autograph he said youre not any good youre just average

639338 boy he can put up a triple double at will im going to vote the way he votes

639427 acabo de leer a un airado periodista de origen ingl s llamado christopher hitchens quien public en slate una arenga
639428 yo pensaba al comenzar a leer el art culo en cuesti n titulado
639429 debido a la cuant a de la condena la lejan a de las fechas de cumplimiento y la repercusi n social de los hechos por los que fue condenado
639430 me sumo al reclamo de desagravio del presidente ch vez hacia los trabajadores
639431 desde hace varios a os hemos escuchado insistentemente decir al presidente ch vez que su gobierno es obrerista sin embargo los hechos demuestran lo contrario
639432 aunque muchos no lo crean hay ministerios y entidades nacionales descentralizadas donde hace m s de 16 a os que no se discuten ni se acuerdan convenciones colectivas de trabajo
639433 un hecho emblem tico es la actitud de la presidenta de la asamblea nacional cilia flores vivo ejemplo del nepotismo quien ha hecho hasta lo imposible para desconocer a nuestro camarada william d az secretario general del sindicato como leg timo representante de los trabajadores de esa entidad y hace poco bot a muchos trabajadores entre ellas varias empleadas que recientemente hab an tenido hijos con el s lo prop sito de abrirle campo a sus familiares
639434 y para no ir muy lejos cito mi caso y el del camarada armando guerra empleado de hidrocapital quienes hemos sido botados a pesar de que somos dirigentes sindicales como retaliaci n pol tica por nuestra posici n incondicional de defensa de los derechos de los trabajadores porque denunciamos la corrupci n el nepotismo porque defendimos a los trabajadores petroleros contra las imposiciones del gobierno y la directiva de pdvsa y porque denunciamos que la reforma constitucional no avanzaba hacia el socialismo sino hacia la conciliaci n con los enemigos de la revoluci n como se ha venido demostrando durante estos ocho meses del 2008 por si fuera poco desde las altas instancias de gobierno se ha desatado una feroz campa a de descalificaci n catalog ndonos como contrarrevolucionarios
639435 en marzo del a o pasado el presidente ch vez arreci contra el movimiento sindical calificando supuestamente como una herencia maldita de la iv rep blica la autonom a sindical en aquella oportunidad areng contra quienes defendemos esa sagrado principio y a trav s de su ministro jos ram n rivero enfil bater as para desconocer a los representantes leg timos de los trabajadores por fortuna los trabajadores de sidor emprendieron una lucha ejemplar que llev a la destituci n del peor ministro de trabajo de los ltimos 50 a os
639436 ahora nos encontramos con el caso del compa ero efra n castro quien fue vejado y humillado p blicamente creo que nadie se esperaba esta actitud prepotente del presidente ch vez yo me solidariz incondicionalmente con el compa ero castro con todos los trabajadores del canal de televisi n y con todos los trabajadores que son ofendidos en su integridad moral y pol tica hace menos de quince d as tambi n me pronunci contra la forma infeliz en que el ministro de energ a y petr leo rafael ram rez se expres sobre los trabajadores petroleros en una revista en chile
639437 lo preocupante de la intolerancia del presidente ch vez es el mensaje pol tico
639438 afortunadamente existen profundas reservas morales y pol ticas entre los trabajadores y los verdaderos revolucionarios me ha emocionado mucho leer la columna contracorriente del periodista ernesto villegas p y conocer su actitud solidaria a toda prueba con efra n castro su padre que en paz descanse a quien conoc personalmente y con quien me encontr en diversos escenarios defendiendo los derechos de los trabajadores debe estar m s que orgulloso por la valent a de su hijo que ha tenido la hidalgu a de colocar su puesto a disposici n a cambio de poder expresar libremente su opini n
639439 suscribir todo reclamo que desde el pueblo y las bases sindicales se le haga al presidente ch vez exigiendo un desagravio para el camar grafo de vtv y a todos los trabajadores venezolanos que se le hayan vulnerado sus derechos

639512 no one can tell you when the aquifer will dry up
639513 but the trend is telling us the water will not be accessible
639514 this is the least discussed problem but its the most important
639515 theres a little bit of water out there and the last drop of it will be the most valuable
639516 so theres every incentive out there to go and get it
639517 theyre very strong if they dont like the government they can overthrow it
639518 at the top you tend to have powerful people who do what they want the average farmer sees that example
639519 now anyone who has the means can access any amount of water
639520 the technology came to a society with no legal framework
639521 the deeper we drill the more iron and fluoride making the water less fit for consumption

639523 the indispensable component of any attempt to build a new world order
639524 the central threat of our time and we must understand the implications our decisions on all manner of regional and global challenges could have for our success in defeating it
639525 almost all objective observers agree that major progress has been made on all three fronts of the iraq war al qaeda the sunni jihadist force recruited largely from outside the country seems on the run in iraq the indigenous sunni insurrection attempting to restore sunni predominance has largely died down and the shiite dominated government in baghdad has at least temporarily mastered the shiite militias that were challenging its authority after years of disappointment we face the need to shift gears mentally to consider emerging prospects of success
639526 the inherent contradictions of the proposed withdrawal schedule compound the difficulties under the fixed withdrawal scheme combat troops are to be withdrawn but sufficient forces would remain to protect the u s embassy fight a resumption of al qaeda and contribute to defense against outside intervention but such tasks require combat not support forces and the foreseeable controversy about the elusive distinction will distract from the overall diplomatic goal nor is withdrawal from iraq necessary to free forces for operations in afghanistan there is no need to risk the effort in iraq to send two or three additional brigades to afghanistan those troops will become available even in the absence of a deadline
639527 bold decision to order a surge of some 20 000 american troops for iraq has brought the debate over the war to a defining stage there will not be opportunity for another reassessment
639528 the assault on the international order conducted by radical groups in both islamic sects
639529 the indispensable component of any attempt to build a new world order
639530 the central threat of our time and we must understand the implications our decisions on all manner of regional and global challenges could have for our success in defeating it
639531 the next president has a great opportunity to stabilize iraq and lay the basis for a decisive turn in the war against jihadist radicalism and for a more peaceful middle east surely he will want to assess the situation on the ground before setting a strategy for his term he should not be limited by rigid prescriptions to vindicate maxims of the past no matter how plausible they once seemed withdrawal is a means the end is a more peaceful and hopeful world

639533 the lambeth conference is required to do something rather than live down to the worst expectations of the bishops who stayed away
639534 we need to negotiate a separation in the communion sooner rather than later to leave the strongest possibility of remaining in some kind of fellowship
639535 a major question is how we move towards that point the highest degree of fellowship whilst allowing for an orderly separation

639589 die moral der menschen hier hat sich durch die kriege sehr ver ndert
639590 ik kan ongeremd associatief en intu tief te werk gaan
639591 beeldend kunstenares guusje kaayk had al veel getekend aan de hand van dansvoorstellingen we kennen elkaar al een lange tijd vanuit de theaterwereld guusje wilde een stap verder gaan door haar tekeningen in beweging te brengen we besloten om samen de voorstelling reanimatie te maken guusje heeft toen dans animaties geschilderd naar aanleiding van ons concept deze beelden vormen samen met de dans de voorstelling
639592 de voorstelling gaat over het opnieuw tot leven brengen van materie in een cyclische vorm de voortdurende herhaling van begrippen als onrust dreiging aanval geweld overleg en vrede
639593 het kruithuis heeft een ronde bouwvorm hierin vinden we het cyclische aspect van reanimatie terug ook past het hele concept van het opnieuw tot leven komen bij een historische plek het kruithuis heeft iets desori nterends en roept tegelijkertijd veel beelden op in de tachtigjarige oorlog ten tijde van de strijd tussen de spanjaarden en de oranjes diende het kruithuis als opslagplaats voor het gevechtsmaterieel het gebouw was volgepakt met kruit en droeg op de voorgevel het motto slaapt om te ontwaken dat is toch een fantastische leus als het gaat om kruit fascinerend is ook dat de poort van zon kruithuis altijd van de stad af werd gebouwd vanwege het risico op ontploffing
639594 reanimatie is geen voorstelling voor een specifieke doelgroep en daarmee voor mij een uitstapje toen we dertien jaar geleden zijn begonnen met de stilte hebben we wel wat voorstellingen voor volwassenen gemaakt maar ik heb me vrij snel toegelegd op het maken van kinderproducties dat ik nu weer een voorstelling heb gemaakt voor volwassenen is overigens geen bewuste keuze dat is simpelweg zo gelopen en evengoed kan het straks geschikt zijn voor kinderen en mijn eigen denken in doelgroepen ondermijnen ik word graag verrast ook door mezelf
639595 het verschil is voor mij niet extreem groot een grove overeenkomst is bijvoorbeeld de ervaring die centraal staat in het kruithuis willen we de mensen echt een belevenis meegeven een reis in de tijd door diverse vertrekken dit geldt natuurlijk ook bij kindervoorstellingen waarbij je kinderen zintuiglijk probeert te prikkelen en te vermaken toch is er een aantal elementen waar je rekening mee moet houden de sc nes die je voor kinderen maakt zijn altijd compacter korter volwassenen hebben uiteraard een grotere concentratieboog je houdt bij kinderen geen expos van twintig minuten daarnaast is het contact tussen danser en publiek anders bij dans voor kinderen is het contact direct als je als danser geen oogcontact maakt ben je ze kwijt je verliest hun aandacht waardoor ze op hun stoel gaan wiebelen en draaien bij volwassenen is dit directe contact geen absolute vereiste je kunt dan meer vrijheid nemen als choreograaf hoef ik nu niet te denken aan hoe ik geweest ben maar kan ik kiezen voor de intu tie in het hier en nu
639596 wat we ook gaan doen we blijven altijd een gezelschap voor kinderen ik word daar simpelweg gelukkiger van ik kan niets met mijn zwarte kant als ik voorstellingen voor kinderen maak dat ik niet geboren had willen worden dat ik de wereld van volwassenen veracht speelt geen enkele rol als ik in het cre ren kinderen voor ogen heb dan zie ik alleen maar hoop voor me het laatste restje uit de doos van pandora ik zie kinderen als slachtoffer van onze maatschappij hun stem wordt dikwijls slecht gehoord het welbekende alles van waarde is weerloos lucebert is hierbij van toepassing ik smelt bij kinderen en mijn doel is dan ook ze een uitzicht te bieden fantasie de idee dat er altijd weer iets nieuws komt
639597 het was vooral hard ploeteren maar na dertien jaar hebben we dan ook heel wat ervaring opgebouwd
639598 i dont know if robert benchley ever commented on operas in his writings but it is certainly a subject i suspect he would have handled exactly as you did
639599 it certainly brought back the memories of when i first started reading robert benchley and the joy his writing brought
639600 the judging was difficult because the finalists were so good
639601 really good writing is timeless benchley created like the persona jack benny created a man who was very much full of himself but in a self deprecating way
639602 my influences came from the more absurdist side of life
639603 larry gilbert writer on your show of shows a funny thing happened on the way to the forum and others too numerous to remember once wrote the comedy writer and comedian sees the world through a different lens
639604 i was a voracious reader of the works of robert benchley
639605 and at least on a subconscious level one of benchleys essays influenced me to go to law school it was about a walter mitty type character who made an absolute fool out of the opposing counsel to the point where the jury was applauding and even the judge was enjoying the show
639606 yikes i cant believe it thanks im still in shock
639607 i can barely maintain my sobriety cuz the great robert benchley society held a contest and wow im a finalist now will i win the top prize high anxiety
639608 now that ive actually won first prize im thrilled and honored but being jewish im still anxious
639609 how to watch a sad movie and retain your manliness
639610 hooray thank you so much and many thanks to mr newhart
639611 in fact right now im making sounds to express my thrilledness but they cant be conveyed in an email without doing some small damage to the keyboard
639612 essays are tough especially at 500 words i wrote my entry in a benchleyesq frenzy i was reading a lot of sweet old bob at the time and the influence shows benchley has always been my favorite humorist
639613 to go from being an accountant to being a stand up comic has always been a dream of mine
639614 thanks for the wonderful news i assume this means i get my 10 entry fee back
639615 all who value humor look up to robert benchley and wonder how the hell does he make it look so easy for this benchley aficionado its a bit numbing having my name linked with his
639616 and this is back when 30 a week was like 20 a week
639617 knowing bob newhart actually read something i wrote even if he barely got through the first paragraph before crumpling and tossing it is intimidating i have grown up with newharts albums stand up movies and television to understand and appreciate what a brilliant humorist he is
639618 this would be the highlight of my career if i had one
639619 the book that most impressed me when i was growing up and influenced my approach to comedy would have been any book by robert benchley or specifically my ten years in a quandary
639620 all entries are read blind so neither bob newhart nor any of the preliminary judges knew who wrote any of the essays that way the competition is entirely merit based
639621 but darn i will enter again next year and see if i make the top ten one more time ill be the poor mans ed tasca he placed 3 times maybe i can get on the top ten list 3 times
639622 i believe mr benchley would be pleased to see how this years contestants are keeping alive his tradition of warm genial witty humor
639623 i hope future judges are as lucky as i was in the quality of their finalists

639702 president mugabe attaches great importance to the ongoing talks which is why he is not going to china for the grand opening of the olympics

639704 the main reason why mugabe would not attend such an occasion is that his status as president is being questioned not just abroad but in his own country
639705 that is why he is so anxious to see the ongoing talks succeeding as this would settle the outstanding issue of his legitimacy

639801 weve got theories weve been talking to police and experts in all different fields family spokesman glenn tunstead told abc radio last week
639802 the difficulty is every theory ends up in a dead end or a point where it becomes ridiculous and theres no sort of factual information to back up you know to make that theory have any substance and thats the difficulty of the whole thing

639804 were hoping that the inquest will drive out that information that the authorities have got or the possibility that other people that havent come forward yet will come forward with something that we can use

639827 i will keep the moratorium in place and prevent oil companies from drilling off floridas coasts
639828 i think its important for the american people to understand were not going to drill our way out of this problem
639829 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
639830 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact
639831 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage

639860 these new cdc numbers lend credence to what public health officials have long been saying that hiv is alive and well and thriving in certain communities in the u s
639861 using these advanced methods to paint a more accurate picture of the numbers of new hiv infections is important for working out where our prevention messages have worked and where there is a need for improvement its time to take a precision strike approach towards hiv prevention in this country
