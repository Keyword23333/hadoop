6250000 we wanted to get a number of really good teams together in a pool play bracket tournament the first week of the season and we had a good turnout with good competition
6250001 weve been flying under the radar and not getting much recognition so far but this is a big time event
6250002 there were some good teams here and it gave us an opportunity to experiment and do some different things
6250003 i thought you said you realized your mistake certainly youd know why you were down
6250004 well theres that but sometimes id wake up and it felt as though my heart were being sawn in half
6250005 nothing at all you say perhaps you were beginning to feel numb you said that youd shut out your friends subconciously and doing so wouldve supposedly taken the right side of your heart as you put it
6250006 i dont know the only thing that seemed to satisfy this feeling if you can call it that was cutting
6250007 if people get down there on the floor and want to start blowing kazoos and making a scene we want to make sure weve got people who stand in front of them with obama signs
6250008 its obvious but i just havent said it yet billy stull has had an outstanding camp
6250009 the guy has played smart hes made good decisions with the football and hes thrown the football very accurately hes shown great leadership skills and hell be the starter on opening day
6250010 having that cloud computing base allows them to manage multiple locations it allows them to move data across from one location to the other
6250011 weve seen a huge demand from companies to ask for a global partnership not only local partners and particularly to invest in emerging markets china poland russia
6250012 a lot of the stuff is custom contracted based on needs
6250013 with ibm i can recover in boulder colo sterling forest n y gaithersburg md as well as many other very large data centers within their network
6250014 part of my companys direction in the future is to expand our business internationally the value of having ibm internationally and their expertise on site in a foreign country is i dont have to have my own personnel
6250015 gains in u s shares overnight and the strong rally in china seen yesterday will help boost sentiment here in seoul as well there is also the attractive valuation factor as shares have fallen a lot in recent weeks
6250016 the index will hold onto the 1 500 level today though gains will be pretty modest as credit worries still pervade the market
6250017 shes always with me in the hours before the competition shes there
6250018 im not the superstitious type dont believe in higher powers but i hope she saw me i wish
6250019 it was very hard it was a family decision to stay and compete and i wanted to do this for my dad
6250020 this year has been one of the hardest years of my life as well as one of the greatest years of my life
6250021 i would much rather trade all my athletic accomplishments to spend one hour with either of my parents again
6250022 a conditional sentence with strict punitive conditions reflects denunciation of the offences of which ms tammam was convicted
6250023 were particularly satisfied with that kind of prohibition she is unable to operate a day home
6250024 the natural gas fired power station would move victorias energy mix towards cleaner energy emitting up to 70 less greenhouse gas than brown coal mr batchelor said
6250025 this power station would help to deliver on our election commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across victorias economy by 60 of 2000 levels by 2050 behind the zimmerman tag
6250026 the distribution heavily favors gnome applications including ones written in mono such as banshee and tomboy
6250027 the company is on track to deliver double digit growth in npat looking forward creating improved shareholder value and delivering world class services and assets to our clients
6250028 we remain confident that the company will continue on its journey of growth underpinned by the knowledge and expertise of the management team and record levels of spending by clients in all markets in particular infrastructure mining and energy
6250029 we have had a good start to full year 2009 with the hospitals experiencing strong demand and the pathology group building on the significant growth of the second half of full year 2008
6250030 it is not expected that the changes to the medicare surcharge levy threshold level announced in the federal budget will impact earnings in the next period with underlying volume growth in hospitals remaining strong and health fund agreements in place with most major health funds for terms to run varying from one to three years
6250031 it was great to be back though not so nice to start out down 2 0
6250032 im happy with this result because we created many chances and my players looked for the win up to the final whistle
6250033 they have not declined to levels that will sustain the current level of profitability
6250034 excellent performance across all of the airlines businesses albeit for the first three quarters of the 2007 08 year
6250035 well advanced in its preparations for a partial australian initial public offering of its frequent flyer business subject to market conditions he said the board would consider this issue further in september
6250036 she agreed at some point in that discussion for sex for money
6250037 i dont know to what extent she did this job
6250038 as far as im concerned shes a teacher that got arrested for prostitution i dont know that she was a career prostitute
6250039 we know we can play better and be more of a unit so we will start that hopefully against andorra and then croatia
6250040 i asked to play against the czechs for this reason to know where the problems are
6250041 that interception we got last year happened to get us to where we wanted to be the super bowl whether he came back or didnt it didnt make much difference
6250042 we are going to go out there the same way and do what we do on defense keep them from scoring and eliminate the big plays
6250043 i know he has a big gun and tries to make big plays and we are going to try to put pressure on the quarterback and try to eliminate big plays
6250044 i just happened to read the route downfield and was able to undercut it and make them turn the ball over
6250045 i didnt know what he was doing at that time
6250046 im trying to watch the receiver i was able to get my head back around and played the ball in the air secured it and went down and helped us get to the super bowl
6250047 i never changed last year from the beginning of the season
6250048 i am still working hard doing the things that i normally do i go out and try to get better
6250049 hopefully i get to play a long time and make a lot more interceptions
6250050 hopefully i can forget about that one and make some bigger ones thats my goal
6250051 i feel very strongly about climate change and this report tackles a wide range of issues so i want to make it available to as many people as possible
6250052 it is a matter of dire urgency that the public be apprised of climate change concerns and that governments act on it
6250053 i certainly hope he does not pick a pro choice running mate
6250054 mccain said life begins at conception and hes been pro life for a long time so id be a bit surprised if he picks a pro choice vice president
6250055 i dont think thatd be a good choice on his part
6250056 by going to invesco field at mile high we doubled the number of boxes and that has helped dramatically that and having the candidate have been a big difference
6250057 given the pricing and lack of carrier sponsorship in the us we believe initial sales of the treo pro will be limited
6250058 weve chosen to partner with microsoft to compete effectively with rim
6250059 even with the growth in this market 90 per cent of the market doesnt have a smartphone it doesnt make sense to fight over the 10 per cent
6250060 we want to reach out to people who dont have a smartphone not people who already love rim
6250061 going forward for premium fully featured devices wi fi is a requirement
6250062 that interception we got last year happened to get us to where we wanted to be the super bowl whether he came back or didnt it didnt make much difference
6250063 we are going to go out there the same way and do what we do on defense keep them from scoring and eliminate the big plays
6250064 i know he has a big gun and tries to make big plays and we are going to try to put pressure on the quarterback and try to eliminate big plays
6250065 i just happened to read the route downfield and was able to undercut it and make them turn the ball over
6250066 i didnt know what he was doing at that time
6250067 im trying to watch the receiver i was able to get my head back around and played the ball in the air secured it and went down and helped us get to the super bowl
6250068 i never changed last year from the beginning of the season
6250069 i am still working hard doing the things that i normally do i go out and try to get better
6250070 hopefully i get to play a long time and make a lot more interceptions
6250071 hopefully i can forget about that one and make some bigger ones thats my goal
6250072 medical surgical nurses practice in a variety of settings and care for a broad range of patients
6250073 this is a perfect time to thank medical surgical nurses for all that they do
6250074 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6250075 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6250076 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6250077 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6250078 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6250079 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6250080 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6250081 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6250082 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6250083 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6250084 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6250085 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6250086 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6250087 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6250088 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6250089 well there you go loboman your coaches should well know that if your going to go the internet route for eligablity you need to go with the magic of tds internet courses
6250090 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6250091 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6250092 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6250093 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6250094 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6250095 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6250096 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6250097 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6250098 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6250099 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6250100 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6250101 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6250102 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6250103 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6250104 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6250105 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6250106 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6250107 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6250108 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6250109 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6250110 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6250111 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6250112 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6250113 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6250114 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6250115 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6250116 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6250117 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6250118 its caught the heart of australians and at the moment the public is really really desperately wanting something to save the whale
6250119 it is possible it might not be probable but its possible that it could be picked up and adopted
6250120 as the calf is still being breast fed we have no way of feeding or socializing it
6250121 so taking this humpback into captivity is not an option
6250122 unless it can go out to open water and find a mother i dont really know whats going to happen
6250123 ma perh palmiro non su quel sito di quei tipacci he sbavano per le strisce
6250124 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6250125 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6250126 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6250127 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6250128 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6250129 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6250130 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6250131 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6250132 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6250133 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6250134 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6250135 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6250136 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6250137 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6250138 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6250139 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6250140 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6250141 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6250142 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6250143 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6250144 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6250145 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6250146 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6250147 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6250148 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6250149 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6250150 who are open to doing something on the production side
6250151 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6250152 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6250153 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6250154 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6250155 abrir investigaci n contra mandatarios que apoyan a las farc para que la corte penal internacional cpi haga lo propio
6250156 instamos a la fiscal a general de la naci n para que inicie las investigaciones penales contra los mandatarios y funcionarios extranjeros cuyas pruebas determinen que han apoyado de m ltiples maneras a la guerrilla narcoterrorista de las farc

6250159 si bien dicha comunicaci n no es una amenaza contra el gobierno colombiano s es un claro indicio de que la corte ya est analizando el caso de colombia con el fin de abrir una investigaci n contra algunos de los protagonistas de nuestro conflicto por la comisi n de cr menes de lesa humanidad
6250160 ha liderado un proceso in dito de enfrentar con la fuerza de las armas del estado a los agentes de violencia y nuestro sistema judicial ha asumido de manera eficiente las investigaciones judiciales
6250161 barack obama is no different only its your money he wants to spend
6250162 positive bio spots that theyve been running the balance of the summer dont appear to be making any significant connection with undecided voters
6250163 when the senate investigated the senator in charge never even called reed to testify and that senator john mccain
6250164 and whos now raising money for mccains campaign ralph reed
6250165 because of john mccain corruption was exposed and people like jack abramoff went to jail
6250166 the distribution heavily favors gnome applications including ones written in mono such as banshee and tomboy
6250167 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6250168 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6250169 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6250170 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6250171 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6250172 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6250173 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6250174 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6250175 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6250176 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6250177 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

6250186 there is no muslim who forsakes a muslim in a situation where his reputation and honor are violated except that allah will forsake him in a situation where he would want his help and there is no muslim who helps a muslim in a situation where his reputation and honor are being violated except that allah will help him in a situation where he would want his help
6250187 whoever helps his brother in secret allah will help him in this world and the next
6250188 the believer to the rest of the believers is like the head to the body the believer is pained at what afflicts the rest of the believers just as the head feels the pain of whatever afflicts the body
6250189 the believers are like a single person if the head hurts the entire body complains and if his eyes hurt the entire body complains
6250190 you see the believers in their mercy and compassion towards each other like a single body if a single limb hurts the rest of the body tends to it to relieve it
6250191 whoever relieves a muslim of a hardship in this life allah will relieve him of a hardship in the hereafter and allah will help his slave so much as he helps his brother
6250192 the muslim is the brother of the muslim he does not oppress him or hand him over and whoever helps his brother allah will help him and whoever relieves the distress of a muslim allah will relieve his distress on the day of resurrection

6250206 it looks like at least from the benchmarks were seeing that six core chips offer more performance than quad cores so yes customers are going to want them what we dont know is how much power the chips consume and how much heat they will dissipate and those are key concerns but all in all this is a pretty big advance in the state of the art and all the major vendors are on board
6250207 these chips outperform anything amd has and probably win on price performance too this could cut amds share of the server market considerably
6250208 intel doesnt have to crank up chip performance right now to thwart amd
6250209 their current products handily outperform amd on server products from my own research i can tell you that x86 server customers have moved away from amd and towards intel so intel didnt need to release this stuff now to catch up to amd or to top them but theyre doing it anyway just to keep the pressure up on amd and on themselves
6250210 if software cant take advantage of it what does it buy you
6250211 you still have software partitioning issues and when you put more cores on a chip you have to run it slower or increase the power consumption budget or thermal limitations

6250229 eradicating the bulls could lead to a social breakdown and a massive loss of knowledge
6250230 we must remember that the worlds current problems are fundamentally a spiritual crisis created by the limited vision of human beings a loss of a sense of connection to our spiritual values political and economic change have never been sufficient in themselves to alleviate suffering when the underlying causes are not also addressed the worst problems on earth warfare poverty ecological destruction and so forth are created from greed hatred prejudice delusion and fear in the human mind to expand the circle of our practice and to face the sorrow in the world around us we must face these forces in ourselves einstein called us nuclear giants and ethical infants only when we have found a compassion a goodness and understanding that transcends our own greed hatred and delusion can we bring freedom alive in the world around us

6250288 obamas answers were thoughtful and considered but a little meandering and not to the point
6250289 a lot of winning a debate is winning the sound bite war and mccain definitely won there
6250290 hillary clinton got the best of him quite a few times and yet he still has this well deserved reputation for eloquence that will follow him into the debates
6250291 people still confuse obama the public speaker with obama the debater
6250292 he put to rest this notion that hes the underdog in the debates
6250293 thats a mixed blessing for him now that he no longer has the advantage of being thought the lesser performer
6250294 john mccain has been a highly under rated performer because of one bad speech he gave in front of the infamous green backdrop the night we secured the nomination
6250295 the truth is hes been honing his skills in washington for the past three decades won all of the republican debates and has the experience of another presidential run under his belt
6250296 we fully expect that mccain will surprise folks with both his speech at the republican convention and his commanding performances at the coming debates

6250334 there seems to me no question that the dark knight is at some level a paean of praise to the fortitude and moral courage that has been shown by george w bush in this time of terror and war
6250335 like w batman is vilified and despised for confronting terrorists in the only terms they understand like w batman sometimes has to push the boundaries of civil rights to deal with an emergency certain that he will re establish those boundaries when the emergency is past
6250336 batman isnt popular partly because hes a zealot and partly because he doesnt bother to explain himself to the press he is independently wealthy having spent years as the head of an industrial company his methods are disturbing his operations bathed in darkness he is misunderstood mistrusted endlessly pursued by the attack dogs of the night and he lives in an undisclosed location isnt it obvious batman is dick cheney with hair

6250338 what batman is doing is heroic but it can be seen as vigilantism as a dark force outside the law

6250386 that interception we got last year happened to get us to where we wanted to be the super bowl whether he came back or didnt it didnt make much difference
6250387 we are going to go out there the same way and do what we do on defense keep them from scoring and eliminate the big plays
6250388 i know he has a big gun and tries to make big plays and we are going to try to put pressure on the quarterback and try to eliminate big plays

6250393 i am still working hard doing the things that i normally do i go out and try to get better
6250394 hopefully i get to play a long time and make a lot more interceptions
6250395 hopefully i can forget about that one and make some bigger ones thats my goal

6250425 its also the case that when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6250426 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6250427 in this case russia will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic

6250481 we were born to make manifest the glory of god
6250482 canada should reject that person as a potential canadian citizen
6250483 concern is the small minority of new immigrants who are here out of their own free will but who demand the full benefit of the canadian charter of rights and the full protection of canadian laws without being willing to assimilate into this society or even show the courtesy of respecting and following its norms and traditions some even show an attitude of defiance to the social traditions of this country
6250484 we must ask whether it is acceptable for canada to lower the standard of human rights for immigrant workers simply because they are being provided with an opportunity that is potentially beneficial to them
6250485 people choose to live in canada because it is one of the best places on the planet to live yet they cant wait to show pride and love for the place they chose to leave

6250504 it seemed like no matter what we threw up there they were covering it with their barrels somehow
6250505 its a tough stretch for me personally the last two weeks ive been kind of out of rhythm
6250506 theyve got a good ballclub theyre really rolling and i wish we could have given them some better competition this week
6250507 you wake up and have some inflammation thats basically what it is
6250508 if hes not ready we wont pitch him well back him up another couple days
6250509 thats the way it goes i dont think that is going to happen but if it did we would back him up and i told him that
6250510 well pitch him when hes ready to pitch and not because his day comes up
6250511 the point is that beckett is really wanting to throw and thats always a good sign
6250512 were hoping we can get this thing squared away real quickly
6250513 steven is one of the best players in the nfl and wed like to have him back
6250514 im working hard to compartmentalize my life its not about me
6250515 if i can go out there and have nothing and get away with five innings and the bullpen does what they do and we get a win
6250516 we had our opportunity we had a walk hit batter bunt single and the bases loaded with nobody out and two pitches later the innings over weve got to score there somehow
6250517 gagne got the bases loaded and out of it all on eight pitches
6250518 id like to tell you a time on it but i cant i dont know what that time is on it

6250522 shawns going to give it a go and well just see how he does reid said
6250523 were going to try to keep good communication with him during the game and give him an opportunity to play
6250524 wed joke about how were not sure if a lot of our fans have jobs because theyre always here the tight end said with a smile wednesday
6250525 its 8 in the morning on weekdays and theyre here 5 in the afternoon theyre still here its pretty cool its been nice to have that kind of support
6250526 most jets fans are die hards said baker who grew up in nearby st
6250527 the fans have come out and supported us for years and now it obviously wont be as easy unless they want to hike over there but the good thing is were not that far away
6250528 i think its big because the jets roots are from long island said michael mone 33 of nearby garden city
6250529 theyve been here since the days of joe namath the fan base really is long island its going to be a little weird a little strange
6250530 being from new jersey itll be about half the commute but ill miss it out here yurga said
6250531 its going to be better for the team though with a state of the art facility florham park will be a setting like this though quiet and clean
6250532 over the time ive been here whether it was this time or the last time i was here its always great to have the energy from the fans said coach eric mangini who was an assistant with the jets from 1997 99
6250533 it gets a little bit long during training camp at times and there are some days where the coffee is just not getting it done having them there and having the kids here having the passion here its always great
6250534 when i first got here in 2000 i really didnt know what to expect but there was always a good crowd out there said defensive end shaun ellis the teams longest tenured player
6250535 we wont be in their backyard anymore but these fans are true fans theyll follow us wherever we go
6250536 long island fans are not happy said dillon who lives in nearby massapequa
6250537 it is sad and i cant not feel sad about it but the team is getting a new facility and a new stadium and its going to be a good thing
6250538 when i first started coming here there was no fencing around the fields so you could put a blanket out and sit there and watch but its become so popular over the years said may wearing an emerson boozer no
6250539 it used to be a few hundred people here and there theyll be missed out here
6250540 new jersey doesnt have teams other than the devils so the jets and giants are new york new jersey teams anyway said jeremy weinstein 45 who lives in marlboro n
6250541 if the jets win the super bowl the ticker tape parade will be down broadway anyway
6250542 were very fortunate to sign a player of theos caliber general manager ed stefanski said
6250543 he is a consummate professional both on the court and off who will provide us with additional depth in the frontcourt while also serving as a mentor to some of our younger players
6250544 he will play as much as we need to have him play harbaugh said
6250545 the thinking is that kyle has had 42 starts and we have a good idea of what he is and what hes been we need to find out more about troy smith he needs those reps he needs them against a defense in a third preseason game where theyre game planning him a little bit and well see how he does
6250546 no i say that because i am confident in what i can do and what i will do smith said
6250547 obviously being a young player i havent had that much time on the field im very very thankful for the situation and the opportunity and im grateful for everything to come
6250548 anytime passes are in the game plan you want to try to hit them all but nothing is perfect when you get out there on the football field this is still the preseason weve still got a long way to go
6250549 one day i showed up to work and my boss was being handcuffed and put in a car
6250550 i figured that was the end of my life insurance career
6250551 ive got good news and bad news the good news is you scored higher on the test than everybody the bad news is my dad wants to meet you and bring your playbook
6250552 i always enjoyed learning why we did the things we did offensively i always asked why sometimes the coaches maybe misunderstood me i wasnt really questioning them as much as i was just wanting to learn
6250553 brilliant is how bowden described richt to strength and conditioning coach dave van halanger
6250554 i had told my wife awhile back that if mark gets a head job id like to go because i think great things could happen van halanger said
6250555 if thats the only thing you can find thats wrong with him thats not bad dooley said
6250556 i started to run up and hug him dooley said with a laugh
6250557 some people have to yell and scream to get their point across said van halanger who indeed followed richt to his first head coaching job and now serves as georgias director of strength and conditioning
6250558 some people have to exhibit certain animation mark knows who he is people respect him because of that hes the head coach but he doesnt have to tell anybody
6250559 i was kind of coaching off of past experiences and even fumes sometimes i didnt study the game on an ongoing basis like i normally do
6250560 which he did a very good job of but it got lost in the translation richt said
6250561 i was listening i still wasnt seeing it in my mind quickly enough to make a change or make a call i would watch games afterward and id just think i cant believe we went the whole game and i didnt call this or do that id just be upset with myself
6250562 he gets fired up when we need him to said senior fullback brannan southerland
6250563 in the locker room at halftime if somethings not going right we need to get yelled at he definitely does that i think it just serves as an example for a lot of people that you can be passionate about something and yet stay calm and keep your head on your shoulders and stay levelheaded
6250564 life turned out the best it ever could have for him
6250565 theres not too much you can do to be honest with you receiver t
6250566 he has to do it himself thats how i see it ive talked to him he knows what he needs to do and hopefully hell do it
6250567 its the organizations team quarterback carson palmer said after practice wednesday
6250568 its their team theyre going to make decisions that they think are best and marvin and the players and all the coaches do the best with what weve got
6250569 his goal is to be ready to play when we go to baltimore so well see but right now hes surprisingly doing better than expected
6250570 i hope he can stay out of trouble and not anything about his football career just can make it and get through and not have any problems palmer said
6250571 its nice to give somebody a second chance a third chance i just hope he makes it
6250572 to have him back is no surprise as far as the things hes capable of doing running back rudi johnson said
6250573 its just whether hes willing to go out and do the things he needs to do to be on this team thats take care of his business off the field and on the field talking to him on tuesday thats where he seems to be at hes in high spirits and he seems to have learned his lesson
6250574 mr brown can do what he wants to do im happy for chris that he has this opportunity hopefully he makes the most of it
6250575 received no course materials and did no work but received course credit
6250576 i do think there is some relief that comes with the filing of the report it allows us to bring closure to what is a sad and embarassing situation for the university krebs said
6250577 when theyre out on the road themselves and doing this sort of thing theyre trying to recruit the best they can sometimes you lose sight of whats important i think theyre two great guys who made some serious mistakes
6250578 all institutions are cautioned that due diligence must be exercised prior to accepting courses from fresno pacific for academic credit and athletic eligibility purposes the committee said in its report
6250579 we are extremely disappointed and frustrated that the committee on infractions refused to look at all the evidence in a fair and equitable way said zeszutek
6250580 the other guy threw two balls at guys heads la russa said
6250581 what were hearing from trainers and physicians is were getting some back injuries when the ball carrier is immediately snapped to the ground by being jerked quickly he said
6250582 if the ball carrier is grabbed by the shoulder or jersey and just ridden to the ground over a couple of yards thats not going to be a foul
6250583 well err on the side of safety well defend the official who may be a little more strict because thats a major point of emphasis parry said
6250584 this is a short dvd that focuses on proper injury prevention tackling techniques said ron courson a member of the committee and director of sports medicine at the university of georgia
6250585 its been distributed to every college in the nation and we encourage every football program to show this to the student athletes
6250586 it seems like when were down were really down oaklands emil brown said
6250587 its not because of lack of effort i cant really find the words to describe it
6250588 at the end its 81 and 81 closer joe nathan said
6250589 this is just a longer stretch of it i dont think anybodys concerned too much about it most of the talk here in the clubhouse was just making sure we had enough underwear
6250590 we cant control what they do until we see em at the end
6250591 we really had some chances and hit the ball manager bob geren said
6250592 any time they land it doesnt matter if you made a good pitch or not said braden who allowed two bunt hits
6250593 it wasnt the right pitch im not happy we lost
6250594 we have to monkey it up and find a way to win baseball games gardenhire said
6250595 hopefully that will carry and bode well as we go along here gardenhire said
6250596 were going to need him the as have lost 11 of their last 13 at the metrodome reyes faced only one batter for the 17th time this season cust struck out twice and leads the al with 158
6250597 what i think is kind of a bummer is if i dont play well these three weeks i wont be in the tour championship perry said on wednesday
6250598 i mean ive had a great year and i think thats not right i dont think thats fair at all for me to win three times and be kicked out of the tour championship but ive kind of been kicked out of all of the tournaments anyway i won the memorial and that didnt get me in the u s open
6250599 it looks to me like what i did this whole year didnt matter and i dont think thats right perry said
6250600 i think there should be some kind of system to where it favors the guy thats had a good year
6250601 i think it should favor the guy who has played well throughout the year but its not going to be in effect this year at all
6250602 it was great to be back though not so nice to start out down 2 0 lippi said
6250603 im happy with this result because we created many chances and my players looked for the win up to the final whistle
6250604 it was important we didnt lose tonight for confidence beckham said
6250605 we know we can play better and be more of a unit so we will start that hopefully against andorra and then croatia
6250606 im very happy and especially excited by the portuguese display he said
6250607 we moved the ball around well and we managed to create a lot of chances were ready for the next phase of work
6250608 these kinds of matches for the last year or so i was losing them
6250609 at some point it makes a difference because you have confidence from these kind of matches and you build up from there
6250610 i lost my rhythm a little bit on my serve because of the wind in the first set
6250611 i couldnt find it in the second as well but still i was fighting to the end and im pleased with this win
6250612 i am so happy with my level of play today
6250613 i always play well here in new haven and i am hoping to play my best
6250614 ive spent a large part of my career at united the last nine years and ill remember that time fondly but feel im ready for a new challenge said silvestre who won four league titles at old trafford
6250615 arsenal is known for playing technical and skillful football and has a young but experienced squad
6250616 im really excited about this next stage of my career hopefully playing my part in helping the club to new successes
6250617 we have a strong squad but a young squad and mikaels versatility experience and caliber will provide the extra depth we need to reinforce our challenge for honors this season wenger said
6250618 his defensive adaptability will serve us well and its a big plus that mikael has top level experience and a great understanding of football in the premier league
6250619 mikael was a great servant and a wonderful professional ferguson said
6250620 we wish him all the best at his new club and thank him for his service
6250621 i followed the managers and coaches advice and then hit the home run he said through interpreter tatsushi hayashi
6250622 inning by inning the stress was leaving me ozeki said
6250623 first of all i think they were a little nervous curacao manager vernon isabella said through interpreter alecto nicholaas about his pitchers
6250624 japan was close to blocking home plate they were covering it way too much
6250625 a perfect storm of negative economic trends is battering working families across the united states
6250626 health care costs are climbing much more rapidly than incomes or the growth in the overall economy
6250627 what is notable is how these problems are spreading up the income scale
6250628 the u s stands out for being the only country that reports significant fractions of the population not getting needed care
6250629 it was the wrong decision and i think anybody that knows anything about the game knows that
6250630 theres no doubt in my mind i would have made those saves you cant live in the past it doesnt matter what somebody did in an olympic gold medal game three years ago
6250631 i think it would be nice to play brazil and reclaim what we wanted to have
6250632 i dont think its a personal thing anymore i think its the team wanting to reclaim what we could have gotten in the world cup it has nothing to do with anything personal right now
6250633 ive never been that player who is overly close to my teammates but yes now we are and its not just winning its living in a foreign country living in an athletes village
6250634 thats something we havent even thought about since last year
6250635 thats definitely been put behind us for a long time it only comes up when the media asks us questions about it

6250642 an effective treatment program builds on the childs interests offers a predictable schedule teaches tasks as a series of simple steps actively engages the childs attention in highly structured activities and provides regular reinforcement of behavior
6250643 yes things will be different but remember how things were different at the beginning of the year when you first came to school
6250644 obviously there is a lot of work to be done to get there
6250645 but weve got some infrastructure in place that will make that happen quickly
6250646 we felt that this service was really a general interest sports service that was disguised as an amateur sports service
6250647 it certainly appears it will have the opportunity to air at least one professional sports show in prime time each and every night thats obviously a concern for us but the crtc in its wisdom has decided its appropriate so we will carry on
6250648 considering the programming that they are suggesting considering the genre protection rules and the amount of opposition they received im a little surprised

6250667 today my little son aged three was sitting with me on the sofa when a crow was sitting on the window my son asked me 23 times what it was and i replied to him all 23 times that it was a crow i hugged him lovingly each time h e asked me the same question again and again for 23 times i did not at all feel irritated i rather felt affection for my innocent child
6250668 i want to see my parents happy forever they have cared for me ever since i was a little child they have always showered their selfless love on me they crossed all mountains and valleys without seeing the storm and heat to make me a person presentable in the society today
6250669 albert get over here albert no dont do that no i said no oh dont make me count albert youre making me count you dont want me to count one albert get over here right now two
6250670 yeah people do that i saw someone the other day
6250671 la soga se rompe siempre por el lado m s delgado
6250672 how long did it take you to think up that question
6250673 i will nominate a person to be vice president my running mate who shares my principles my values and my priorities and thats what i can tell you
6250674 theres already been things out there in the media hes already made up his mind hes going to announce on such and such a day
6250675 i have not made the decision and were in the process and if i say anything more than that i guarantee you theres going to be another one of these firestorms obviously were going to be announcing soon because we have no choice but ive got to tell you its one of the toughest things ive ever done
6250676 i think he knows how to reach across party lines the same way barack obama does
6250677 yesterday senator obama got a little testy on this issue he said im questioning his patriotism
6250678 let me be very clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgment
6250679 one of the least experienced candidates for president in the last 100 years
6250680 so my job in this election is to say i honour his service but i dont honour his policies and i dont honour his politics
6250681 our focus at the denver super rally will be to expand the debates beyond just two parties
6250682 its an issue of central concern to many americans and extends far beyond any one candidate it is a first amendment matter of speech petition and assembly during a presidential election for both the candidates and the voters
6250683 if tens of millions of americans could hear the nader gonzalez message through the presidential debates it would be a three way race
6250684 my apology to ralph nader for not demanding that he be included in the debates
6250685 i met with sean penn and we talked at length
6250686 he was very clear that he is not currently planning to endorse any candidate in the general election but that he has serious concerns about the state of presidential debates he did support kucinich in the primaries and saw how dennis was excluded from msnbc debates
6250687 ok it was great getting to know you over the past insert length of time you take care
6250688 wow why isnt he shaken up over this did he even care that i broke up with him
6250689 did i do the right thing breaking up with him
6250690 gosh just two weeks ago we were out to dinner and she stayed over here and we were so close

6250702 can clouds predict earthquakes youtube has footage of strange multicoloured clouds seen just before the recent earthquake struck sichuan province in china the first impression is of a rainbow smeared on to small scraps of clouds a phenomenon best known in a circumzenithal halo this is created when sunlight shines through cirrus clouds full of tiny hexagonal ice crystals shaped like plates the crystals behave like glass prisms splitting the light into a bow with the colours of the spectrum often brighter than a rainbow but one puzzle is that the colours in the chinese clouds were upside down from a normal circumzenithal halo red pointing towards the horizon and blue towards the sun instead of the other way round

6250705 while presidents have issued signing statements for quite some time this president has issued a significantly larger percentage of signing statements challenging or objecting to various provisions of the law
6250706 78 percent of president bushs more than 150 signing statements have raised constitutional or legal objections compared with only 18 of all of president clintons
6250707 it appears that the dead snake was dropped into the tank by a bird
6250708 the tanks are cleaned regularly and it s unlikely that the dead reptile could have been lying there for long
6250709 its an important signal but there is also important substance to it
6250710 in practical terms nato is offering close cooperation with the georgian government and the georgian military
6250711 i think the formal process kicked off with the establishment of a nato georgia commission
6250712 its right to see georgian and ukrainian membership as part of a process to build up these countries as a permanent fixture
6250713 can only be positive for map but it doesnt wipe out the questions from before or the concerns of some allies none of that has gone away
6250714 a well placed official in the russian ministry of defence
6250715 to freeze all military cooperation with nato and allied countries
6250716 it is our understanding that other nato countries will receive similar notes
6250717 do we really mean to commit ourselves to war against the russian federation if something like this happens again
6250718 a hole i swear im gonna slot one of these kids one day

6250721 the eyes are the first thing that you have to destroy because they have seen too many bad things
6250722 cms goal for updating and enhancing the hospital compare web site is to provide usable and accurate information about hospital performance to providers and communities that will encourage hospitals to excel in the quality of care they provide
6250723 with these new enhancements consumers and health care providers will be able to look at individual hospital mortality scores we hope that this new information will cement the web sites role as a key driver in improving the quality and reliability of care in the nations hospitals
6250724 people in the general public look at mortality or survival rate as being a very key indicator
6250725 and pneumonia heart attack and heart failure are three areas in which we have national agreement in how to define measure and report outcomes
6250726 its great to know how you are doing you need to know how youre doing so you can do better
6250727 in the short run it will allow the hospital to look more carefully at their own data and improve things but for individual patients who want to choose their own care it can be more misleading than helpful
6250728 it is a good way to get the process going but it is not enough and not the right type of information
6250729 we are still in the early stages of this process
6250730 it is a bit hard to digest for the average consumer
6250731 we have been working with cms for five or six years to come up with measures that people could trust
6250732 but one thing that is true is that no one sees this measure as a means to select hospital when critically ill
6250733 we think that putting this information out and clearly communicating it to hospitals and their boards means that people have to look at their performance it is a tool to understand how you are doing
6250734 i do hope that it empowers groups of patients and community groups and hospital boards to engage in a conversation with their institution they really need to be held accountable
6250735 one of the firemen initially began cardiopulmonary resuscitation but attempts to revive him were unsuccessful

6250740 i enjoy working here and with my background providing care to those without insurance is very rewarding to me

6250749 sometimes when im having a session and engaged with an entity another one will appear for no reason thats what happened this time it was heath ledger clear as day looking just like he did in a knights tale only he was wearing street clothes he looked very confident and young
6250750 he looked me right in the eye and said life is too fucking short
6250751 heath said he would have given up the fame and fortune just to spend more time with matilda looking back at his life he realized that being driven towards having a great acting career also carried its share of high costs but he didnt seem sad at all
6250752 heath said he couldnt have been more pleased at how the the dark knight turned out he said he was extremely happy for all of his castmates he even said he was looking out for morgan freeman on the night of his accident and he sent positive vibes to christian bale when he ran into his family troubles he told me he would continue to act as sort of guardian angel for all of his friends and family with that he smiled and disappeared

6250763 our results appear to demonstrate that vigabatrin induced satiety in these animals
6250764 given the growing obesity epidemic we felt that examining vigabatrins therapeutic efficacy for obesity was particularly relevant
6250765 the fact that these results occurred in genetically obese animals offers hope that this drug could potentially treat severe obesity
6250766 this would appear to be true even if the obesity results from binge eating as this disorder is characterized by eating patterns that are similar to drug taking patterns in those with cocaine dependency
6250767 this is a significant step forward in the long term management of low back pain
6250768 the results of this study revealed that the alexander technique can help back pain it probably does this by limiting muscle spasm strengthening postural muscles improving co ordination and flexibility and decompressing the spine
6250769 this means that patients can have fewer activities or functions limited by back pain
6250770 i think the rest is more needed its something that weve been cautious about all year and something weve exploited every chance weve had to give these guys an extra day of rest jamie moyer is 45 years old hes a wizard and great at what he does but any day we can give him a rest were going to give him a rest

6250777 si se deroga este decreto legislativo el parlamento es libre de hacerlo pero tengo la obligaci n de decirle al per que es un grav simo error que impide el cambio y que lo nico que va a hacer es mantener un siglo m s a nuestras comunidades campesinas en la exclusi n y en la marginalidad

6250785 we will leverage the combined resources of both companies to strengthen our structural biology capabilities and seek out innovative therapies for patients
6250786 we found that survival for teenagers and young people with cancer improved overall from 63 per cent between 1979 and 1984 to 74 per cent between 1996 and 2001 which is great news but more needs to be done to drive this figure even higher
6250787 its important that cancer services are tailored to suit teenagers and young adults as their needs differ from older adults and children clinically and psychologically research like this is needed to measure how much of an impact this tailored treatment could have
6250788 our research has also identified cancers where survival rates remain poor highlighting the need for continuing research in those areas to drive up survival
6250789 research like this is vital if we are to measure the impact of changes to the way teenagers with cancer are treated recruiting more young people onto clinical trials
6250790 its important that this group of patients receive the most appropriate treatment and cancer research uk will continue investing in research to work towards this goal
6250791 bupropion xl compliments our existing buproprion sr offerings and expands the dosage options for our customers and patients this approval also highlights actavis groups focus and expertise in bringing complex controlled release technologies to the marketplace
6250792 the long term improvement in physical function that we observed in patients who have undergone knee replacement surgery is striking when set against the decline that occurred in the comparison group
6250793 these benefits extended to those patients who were clinically obese our results show that as long as appropriate selection criteria are applied with regard to fitness for surgery there seems little justification for withholding the operation from patients who are obese
6250794 just get over it why cant you forgive forget and move on
6250795 aaron didnt do anything wrong he did what i did he used the guard to go to ou
6250796 christian strong duty values heart country proud blah blah blah
6250797 and there are too many air national guardsmen that have served for him to do that he is not one of them
6250798 right after sept 11 things settled down and deployments were starting to come down
6250799 we had received a requirement to send a team to kuwait and all of a sudden aaron submits a conscientious objector packet i believe it was a subterfuge to keep from going to the desert cause he was on the list
6250800 i also did everything i was asked to do and went everywhere i was asked to go i sought the co status mainly because of my christian principles
6250801 and i had serious questions about whether or not i could take someones life
6250802 youre not deployed while the request is being acted on
6250803 so until its either approved or disapproved the co application he was saying he cant pick up a weapon to defend this country he sat in an administrative role at will rogers while other people filled in for him and went to the desert
6250804 honestly it never really entered my mind when i signed up for the service that i might have to take another persons life thats why it was such a tough decision i did it to protect the guys i was with
6250805 i did a brief investigation found out what he was doing and submitted the information to the judge advocate general jag
6250806 when youre in a certain status you have to pay for your meals
6250807 but he was going over and eating and not paying for his meals which constitutes fraud
6250808 it was over one meal and he placed me in cuffs and said he was charging me with fraud people were shocked they were completely surprised
6250809 he was involuntarily mobilized and deployed stateside under operation noble eagle which was only stateside i was deployed with him at this time while deployed he did everything he could think of to get home after he found that there was a chance we could be forward deployed overseas
6250810 he was required to pay for meals he ate at the base dining facility
6250811 he was investigated and it was found that even after being told this he still ate there without paying for those meals
6250812 was an attempt to divert attention away from the gops own problems
6250813 it seems strange ironic maybe that a group that has their own ethical problems such as disgraced former speaker lance cargill who is said to be under an ethics investigation for shaking down lobbyists would point the finger at someone else roger warren should worry about the beam in his own eye before he worries about the splinter in mine
6250814 well you guys did it so we get to do it
6250815 was an attempt to divert attention away from the gops own problems

6250821 the team was disciplined and we managed to cope with the pressure very well
6250822 in this all important match we had only one chance but we didnt let it slip

6250828 although the seismic is still under examination my preliminary observation is that there are two very large anticlinal structures present in the catchers mitt prospect area that could quite possibly contain over 2 3 tcf of recoverable gas ive seen some areas in alaska that are being drilled based on only 4 or 5 short lines fox was extremely fortunate to get this excellent and comprehensive seismic package of high quality data that is such a perfect fit to their project area
6250829 the 46 000 acre catchers mitt prospect is very exciting with the declining natural gas production and reserves in the cook inlet and the proximity of the catchers mitt to existing infrastructure this project is important to the south central alaskan gas consumers for both its size and ability to access the market quickly

6250842 because of john mccain corruption was exposed and people like jack abramoff went to jail

6250859 we are very proud of the double digit positive returns we have been able to generate for our clients in the low risk growth and income portfolio over the past year

6250945 ive no regrets whatsoever with the decision i made to represent england
6250946 a year ago when it was being talked about there were mixed thoughts running through my mind
6250947 i though of jarrod cunningham a good mate of mine who i played with in new zealand and whose opinion i respected i knew what he went through
6250948 he was asked to play for england as well but turned it down and said he would never wear the rose
6250949 i thought about it knowing i didnt get the opportunity to play for new zealand at the highest level
6250950 to get the chance to play at the highest level and test myself against the best players in the world is fantastic
6250951 you do get the odd one or two text messages saying what are you up to but the people who mean a lot are really supportive
6250952 one opinion in particular that i respect is norm hewitts he sent a lovely e mail wishing me all the best and giving his blessing
6250953 he was a person i looked up to as a leader and a player when i first saw the e mail from him i thought oh heck he might say something about wearing the england jersey
6250954 but he told me to go and grab it with both hands and to do my best to get comments like that was a real boost
6250955 not once have i thought shucks what have i done im a kiwi i have no regrets whatsoever
6250956 im proud to wear my england training kit and hopefully ill get to pull on the jersey as well
6250957 if you look at the squad that went over there compared to this one its completely different

6250972 is it typical for a losing candidate to have their own whip team no but its also not usual for a losing candidate to get 18 million votes either
6250973 at the start of the year we noticed demand was increasing
6250974 it means we can appeal to people who are disillusioned with traditional church
6250975 the flip side is the uncertainty has meant weve seen people we otherwise wouldnt have seen who have come along because they are asking the big questions about life
6250976 ive never tried to preach to people or take a holier than thou attitude
6250977 i have a beer from time to time but ive seen from my family what can happen and its made me more cautious
6250978 i share with you a belief in the almighty ultimately it is a service to him through helping our fellow citizens that motivates many of us to engage in the public activities on which this conference is focused that is a very appropriate way to view public service because all nations and states are ultimately governed by him
6250979 nobody outside of my family influenced me more than he did i never made a major decision without calling and asking his advice and counsel

6250987 theres a big negative feedback loop and theres no way out of it
6250988 as the stock falls more and more its more likely the government steps in and more likely equity holders get wiped out
6250989 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything
6250990 they cant keep playing games with the accounting rules to avoid taking their losses
6250991 it could be tomorrow it could be six months from now
6250992 the rationale for government involvement is to maintain fannie and freddies role in the marketplace which comes through buying mortgages
6250993 a well placed official in the russian ministry of defense
6250994 to freeze all military cooperation with nato and allied countries
6250995 it is our understanding that other nato countries will receive similar notes

6250997 women really came out during the primaries they voted in numbers we havent seen in decades
6250998 emilys list of course is going to present information or data that is favorable to the candidate that they are backing
6250999 look this didnt just happen by accident i think the obama campaign deserves a lot of credit for identifying the way gen y voters relate to this election
6251000 when you look at someone his age versus mccains age theres going to be a resonance there even just talking about technology and his understanding of technology he speaks their language and he understands their world

6251008 we used to meet him there in the past but with no official duties he was completely different
6251009 diabetes and heart disease is in our family and we know we have to be careful
6251010 once you can predict whos going to get it and you can detect it in its early phases then you can use that information to develop new treatment algorithms new treatment options
6251011 so what we hope to do is to be able to measure those 25 proteins in a tiny tiny drop of blood
6251012 so whats in it for the patient is a longer life a better life and a likelihood of not developing heart failure
6251013 i hope this makes some kind of difference for someone else i pray that it does
6251014 it might be that the heart is trying to heal itself and reawakens things it knows it needs to shape and fix but it is a really bad plan
6251015 were looking for changes in the blood that reflect changes in the heart
6251016 the specific kinds of proteins and peptides were looking for are those that reflect the changes that occur in the function and the structure of the heart
6251017 we think we can understand why some patients with hypertension develop heart failure and others dont and we think we can predict which patients are going to develop heart failure and which are not and we can determine whos got heart failure early on so that we can treat it in the reversible phase
6251018 if you could change any aspect of the science fiction field itself publishing mainstream acceptance fans or whatever what would it be and why
6251019 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words

6251042 that was basically the game right there we had our opportunity we had the bases loaded with nobody out two pitches later the innings over we got to score there somehow you got to score a couple of runs at least there
6251043 with my limited soccer experience when i was younger we used to play itd be one of those games where you played the whole game on their end of the field but somehow they got a couple of breakaways and ended up winning the game
6251044 yeah i felt like we had opportunities you just have to tip your hat to gagne for getting out of that big jam there
6251045 he made a couple of really good pitches and j j is dangerous he always seems like he hits a home run every time we play them it was just a tough game i dont think that it was a poorly played game it was a tough game where we just didnt get the big hit and they did
6251046 today thats my problem the walks to the leadoff man
6251047 it doesnt really matter whether he dropped it or not
6251048 im embarrassed that i didnt run as hard as i should have i took it for granted that he was going to catch it i was upset that i popped a 3 1 pitch up i relearned a valuable lesson there
6251049 you cant take anything for granted thats a good lesson for everybody unfortunately it happened to me but i think every once in a while you have to relearn hard lessons
6251050 in my mind i was telling myself here we go im going to get it done just positive thoughts because i was like heres my chance to help the team i was looking for a changeup over the middle i got my pitch i just got jammed

6251133 there are a tremendous number of first time voters who will be crucial in this election and youth vote 08 will provide direct insight into the issues they are facing along with their mindset
6251134 pollsters are saying the youth vote will decide this election
6251135 o certo que hoje a grande maioria dos trabalhadores do pa s aderiu paralisa o
6251136 in the uk we have something called nhs direct there is an online service but i dont think you can type in symptoms but you can research conditions and illnesses
6251137 i read an interview with the owners of this virginia spa they said that when they did group pool sessions with the doctor fish some folks got lots of attention and some folks didnt
6251138 grading policies that work against standards and how to fix them
6251139 that their synagogues or schools be set on fire that their houses be broken up and destroyed and they be put under a roof or stable like the gypsies in misery and captivity as they incessantly lament and complain to god about us
6251140 they will submit they are insignificant little people sumissive as dogs and they sweat with embarrassment when you talk to them
6251141 there are significant competition problems arising from baas common ownership of seven uk airports this is evident from its lack of responsiveness to the needs of its airline customers and a lack of initiative in planning capacity
6251142 by calling not just for a fundamental restructure of baa but also for a review of the governments air transport white paper the commission risks delaying that delivery of new runways and making better customer service less not more likely
6251143 we are delighted by the decision which we have been calling for years
6251144 musharraf had lost his utility as a useful asset for the war on terror
6251145 and did not want the us in pakistan ayub khan kicked the americans out of pakistan and closed down the badabar airforce base
6251146 the pakistanis looked me in the eye and lied to me
6251147 the americans had been putting pressure on islamabad since february for him to get its act together against the taliban and al qaeda and pakistans foreign minister shah mahmood qureshi and pakistans ambassador to washington husain haqqani always told washington that the government could not move forward independently because of musharraf
6251148 hence musharraf was politely told by washington through various channels to gracefully resign but he remained defiant and ultimately washington pulled its support of him and the ruling coalition moved for his impeachment which forced him to resign
6251149 the army will play the same role it played from 1996 to 1998
6251150 the american role has always been paramount in pakistans politics the late general zia ul haq was defiant of washingtons interests and he faced an accidental death in a mysterious plane accident in 1988 had musharraf tried to exercise his constitutional powers to dissolve the assemblies he would also have been obstructing american interests in the region and would have faced a zia like fate
6251151 now the americans will have to use the two remaining national assets for their interests the political parties and the army chief
6251152 zardari because of corruption cases that have been leveled against him can be easily manipulated and therefore he will act obediently on their advice
6251153 i suspect that kiani is already part of their game
6251154 yes he could be the one but asfandyar failed to uphold his promised role to control militancy in the tribal areas without resort to military operations
6251155 in my opinion nawab attaullah mengal a baloch politician should be the president of the country given the recent mistreatments done in balochistan province in the name of military operations
6251156 there was no reason to use such brute force in a tribal area like bajaur
6251157 said gul compared to north and south waziristan where militancy is deep rooted the terrain is much more hospitable in bajaur
6251158 the only reason for such military action was to destroy the talibans approaches to kunar where american forces are all out to get the taliban kunar province lies in the northeast and connects to kabul previously the taliban were focused only on southeastern provinces
6251159 this is the role washington wants the pakistani army to play the cost is paid by pakistanis and 250 000 people were displaced during the bajaur operation
6251160 gul added pointing to the fact that in terms of security issues especially those relating to afghanistan pakistan is still joined at the hip with the us for which it has since 2001 received over us 10 billion in aid and military equipment
6251161 all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds
6251162 we are as profoundly sceptical of this philosophy as voltaire intended us to be since dr pangloss was old pedantic and deluded maintaining his misguided beliefs even after experiencing great suffering no amount of panglossian gloss and no amount of spin cannot hide the emerging catastrophy and existing crisis in nato the troop strengths are not near the levels needed and most are not doing the job as it should be done its a classic heros quest tale a sort of ancient greek mission impossible in which the hero embarks on a sea voyage into an unknown land with a great task to achieve he is in search of a magical rams fleece which he has to find in order to reclaim his fathers kingdom from the usurper
6251163 i dont think that theres a crisis i dont think theres a risk of failure
6251164 my view is that it represents potentially the opportunity to make further progress faster in afghanistan if we had more forces there
6251165 but im realistic about politics here in europe my view is that governments here in europe understand the importance of afghanistan they just arent able to do certain kinds of things and we understand that
6251166 within nato we have agreed on a reasonable share out of tasks which in my view is very wise
6251167 our allies might think we should do more in afghanistan but our message is that we are already the third largest troop contributing nation and we are doing other things for the whole of afghanistan
6251168 i think people in britain should be aware that we lost two world wars and we have a different attitude to the question of soldiers wars and blood
6251169 of the 25 countries who have deployable forces in the nato alliance 12 of them are represented in the south and south east of afghanistan
6251170 we have now seen that the french have been prepared to deploy important forces into the south in small but significant numbers
6251171 were hearing today that other countries are prepared to increase their forces i spoke recently to the polish chief of the defence staff and they are going to increase their forces so this is a progression
6251172 the most successful political and military alliance in the world will survive this and will improve
6251173 my message to the canadian public is be a bit patient
6251174 people have come to me with other ideas but lingerie is a passion for me and just like music and acting i cant do it unless i put 100 percent into it
6251175 theres something for every woman and thats very important to us ive always hated when lingerie is uncomfortable so the fit and comfort was key
6251176 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
6251177 the amount of fail on theforum com is reaching epic proportions
6251178 because i am a woman i must make unusual efforts to
6251179 a priest is ordained with the privilege of celebrating the churchs sacraments by nothing less than a holy order
6251180 the behaviors attributable to certain priests involved in this matter not only betray those holy orders but diminish the stature of the faithful and responsible priests who dispatch their ministry effectively and faithfully day in day out
6251181 our clients are trying very hard to right the unrightable wrong
6251182 the civil process is not something that is amenable to righting this kind of wrong but theyre working very hard to try to come to a process where children in the future are protected
6251183 im glad to see this is settled but i feel sad though
6251184 there were so many people involved families good priests good people in the church who have been hurt by this
6251185 cms goal for updating and enhancing the hospital compare web site is to provide usable and accurate information about hospital performance to providers and communities that will encourage hospitals to excel in the quality of care they provide
6251186 with these new enhancements consumers and health care providers will be able to look at individual hospital mortality scores we hope that this new information will cement the web sites role as a key driver in improving the quality and reliability of care in the nations hospitals
6251187 people in the general public look at mortality or survival rate as being a very key indicator
6251188 and pneumonia heart attack and heart failure are three areas in which we have national agreement in how to define measure and report outcomes
6251189 its great to know how you are doing you need to know how youre doing so you can do better
6251190 in the short run it will allow the hospital to look more carefully at their own data and improve things but for individual patients who want to choose their own care it can be more misleading than helpful
6251191 it is a good way to get the process going but it is not enough and not the right type of information
6251192 we are still in the early stages of this process
6251193 it is a bit hard to digest for the average consumer
6251194 we have been working with cms for five or six years to come up with measures that people could trust
6251195 but one thing that is true is that no one sees this measure as a means to select hospital when critically ill
6251196 we think that putting this information out and clearly communicating it to hospitals and their boards means that people have to look at their performance it is a tool to understand how you are doing
6251197 i do hope that it empowers groups of patients and community groups and hospital boards to engage in a conversation with their institution they really need to be held accountable
6251198 the children delivered via gestational surrogacy are healthy and already under rickys full time care
6251199 ricky is elated to begin this new chapter in his life as a parent and will be spending the remainder of the year out of the public spotlight in order to spend time with his children
6251200 i never think that people die they just go to department stores
6251201 the pattern was people in certain long term care facilities
6251202 the median age in the males is 76 and in the females is 80
6251203 this is a company that has a culture of food safety
6251204 were taking appropriate broad comprehensive and definitive action as it relates to this facility this involves people we want people to understand theres a recall we want people to have that information
6251205 i strongly advise the public especially those at high risk for listeriosis to make sure they avoid consuming these products
6251206 i have also asked all public health units to advise emergency rooms in their jurisdictions to be on alert for cases all suspect and confirmed cases of listeriosis must be reported immediately to local public health units and in turn to the ministry within one business day of notification of report
6251207 they would simply not use the meat they would move into other foods its as simple as that
6251208 people arent going to take a chance the products theyre talking about arent ones that are a heavy part of menus in most of the homes i havent heard from anybody who has an issue over this
6251209 to predict when youre going to complete an investigation is practically impossible
6251210 with the tomato issue in the united states it went on for three or four months
6251211 we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause but food safety and quality at mcdonalds will not be compromised
6251212 we are closely monitoring the situation and are taking guidance from the canadian food inspection agency
6251213 i dont think any local government can just suck it up
6251214 we are low hanging fruit for the governor a lot of local governments have had to make very hard decisions about services and taxes
6251215 they see their constituents every day they hear the complaints about taxes
6251216 right now we are fighting over pennies there is no more money four million dollars would be a huge hit it would immediately mean layoffs and stuff being closed
6251217 was amazed at the assertion that local governments are out of control spenders we went from 647 million to 580 million in atlantas general fund how you translate that to out of control spending id like to see
6251218 if we don get the 24 million from the state it does put us in a pinch
6251219 that tax relief grant was figured in as part of our revenue budget
6251220 would set a terrible precedent as our property owners were promised those savings
6251221 hes not cutting his budget hes just going to the taxpayers and saying you pay for it
6251222 its just totally irresponsible i cant believe that hes doing it
6251223 you know the song fly away from poe the song is you you are the free bird you must fly
6251224 youre taking two literature classes thats alot of papers to write
6251225 gosh just two weeks ago we were out to dinner and she stayed over here and we were so close
6251226 mccain takes lead over obama in a sharp turnaround republican john mccain has opened a 5 point lead on democrat barack obama in the u s presidential race and is seen as a stronger manager of the economy according to a reuters zogby poll released on wednesday mccain leads obama among likely u s voters by 46 percent to 41 percent wiping out obamas solid 7 point advantage in july and taking his first lead in the monthly reuters zogby poll

6251287 man i really wanted to come over and talk to you whats your name
6251288 of course thats a lot harder when the family business is winning gold medals
6251289 i put my pants on just like the rest of you one leg at a time except once my pants are on i make gold records
6251290 no your government requires you to get a visa in advance you have to go back to the paraguayan consulate to get a visa
6251291 i had planned to go to the inauguration of president lugo
6251292 no he could get in trouble when he arrived and hed certainly get in trouble when he left paraguay
6251293 well well have to see wont we but he has promised to give his presidential salary to the poor thats a first for this country maybe theyll rob less than all the others
6251294 soldiers will never again be sent out to kill campesinos
6251295 weve organized on issues that are relevant to people especially the poor people of paraguay who are the majority that is paraguay is a poor country i mean its rich in the sense that you can drop a seed anywhere and it will grow but the people here are very poor
6251296 here in paraguay there are only two classes of people those with shoes and those without thats it theres no middle class and the poor are the poorest in the world
6251297 of six million paraguayans a million and a half live outside the country working in argentina or spain or elsewhere
6251298 im the mother of one of the founders of that party
6251299 and so today were celebrating this is a celebration of the people of paraguay because we won not with guns but with votes a battle against a party of genocide
6251300 ill give you an example a friend of mine is in the hospital today with her malnourished child its a hospital with everything you could ask for but the baby is allergic to wheat and requires a special kind of milk the milk costs 80 000 guaran s 20 a liter where is she going to get that kind of money were hoping that tomorrow president lugo is going to do what he really has to do
6251301 were all going to be with him in this struggle because we dont want any more of this suffering
6251302 it was the young people who founded the party all very young people and they believe in socialism were big and were growing there are 6 000 militants in asunci n but were a national presence and have chapters all over the country
6251303 look at the houses theyre made out of cardboard and things rescued from the garbage thats why theres so much sickness like dengue borne from the dirty water in the marginal neighborhoods and you know for them dengue fever is deadly they die from dengue and they die from tuberculosis because tuberculosis is a disease from poverty you know theyre undernourished and susceptible to such diseases which kill them and so were working against all this and we want to make paraguay an example to the world
6251304 each neighborhood has a nucleus of the party but we organize in popular assemblies around the needs that the local people have thats how we hope to build the socialism of the 21st century
6251305 i refuse to live in a country where some cant sleep because of fear and others cant sleep because theyre hungry
6251306 the party is over and its time to get to work today hope has won may it continue for a long time to come

6251308 it would be a sin to change the message it would be a sin not to change the method
6251309 the planning phase of the project will be completed by the end of this year
6251310 bids for the project will start in 2009 and construction could be launched in the same year
6251311 if there is the demand we could provide water for our neighbors as well including south cyprus
6251312 we can expect with high probability this year will be cooler than the previous five years
6251313 definitely the la nina should have had an effect how much we cannot say
6251314 up to july 2008 this year has been cooler than the previous five years at least it still looks like its warmer than average
6251315 of course at the beginning of the year there was la nina and that would have had the effect of suppressing temperatures somewhat as well
6251316 but actually la nina is showing signs of moving towards a more neutral state
6251317 we have used the methods and principles taught by charles to almost immediately make 12 400

6251321 having left your hometown to find fortune and glory and to see the world you and your best friend drevin have been fighting as mercenaries in valdis army for the last few years
6251322 you have been transported to greilyn beach via dragon flight and ordered to travel through the trenches the landing force has prepared to help valdis secure a powerful artifact not much is known about the artifact other than that it lies within a temple nearby called the temple of the coast and that the islands dryad inhabitants currently protect it
6251323 after securing the temple of the coast at greilyn beach valdis rather than giving a reward for his success savagely attacked all of the mercenaries
6251324 you were knocked unconscious and had it not been for your best friend drevin stepping in front of you at the last moment you probably wouldnt even be alive
6251325 you were discovered by the dryads who took you back to the treetop village of eirulan as a prisoner where you overheard an elf known as amren asking your warden to treat you kindly but you do not know why
6251326 freeing the captured dryads has gained you more respect than is usually given to a prisoner but to earn full trust and freedom you must burn down the four known morden watchtowers in the jungles surrounding eirulan
6251327 burning down the morden watchtowers has gained you the respect of the dryads
6251328 taar removed the prisoners ring of submission from your neck but the dryads believe that you were infected with a deadly plague from what youve been told your only hope for a cure is to reach the elven shrine at the top of the ridge in the western greilyn jungle and drink from the fountain there
6251329 after drinking from the fountain in the elven shrine you filled your vial with the last of the curative water you have been asked to bring it to a colony of exiled dryads who have the plague
6251330 the old man you saved is interested in all things azunite and calls himself the azunite scholar
6251331 he confirmed what taar told you there is a portal to the mainland on the eastern shore of greilyn isle that leads off the island he also warned you that you must pass through the kithraya caverns to reach it
6251332 a human battalion from windstone fortress has been searching for a powerful azunite weapon they tell you that the keys to finding the weapon are guarded by the skath a fierce desert race
6251333 placing the four stelae revealed the location of a lost azunite vault find it and retrieve the weapon inside
6251334 the azunite ancestor within the lost vault of the azunites has revealed much evidently you are a direct descendant of the great azunai himself which explains how you were able to wield the azunite bowl without harm
6251335 you must now travel to windstone fortress to unlock the bowls power and aid those stationed there
6251336 valdis and his archmage have entered the temple of xeria at the heart of windstone fortress hopefully the azunite artifact is as powerful as they say because youre going to need all the power you can get to help save windstone fortress
6251337 your hometown has suffered a devastating attack find out what happened
6251338 celebhel the elder told you that princess evangeline of the northern reaches took the aegis of death away by caravan to snowbrook haven valdis arrived not long after and demanded the aegis when he discovered that it was gone valdis commanded his archmage to take vengeance on the town of amanlu in the resulting destruction the towns bridge was broken if you have any chance of catching up to the caravan you must convince finala the town engineer to repair the bridge this will be easier said than done finala is a childhood friend of yours but she harbors some resentment surrounding your decision to leave amanlu and join valdis army youll definitely have some explaining to do
6251339 finala had been on her way to activate the prism of the elves an ancient protective device that should put out the magical flames in town you convinced her to return to amanlu to work on repairing the bridge so now it is up to you to activate the prism of the elves
6251340 now that finala has repaired the bridge you can attempt to catch up to princess evangelines caravan and ensure that the aegis of death doesnt fall into the hands of valdis
6251341 you confronted the vaikesh prophet about the aegis and the princess you learned that he has the aegis but instead of giving it to you he fled catch him and recover the aegis of death
6251342 after defeating the vaikeshs knotted shambler the azunite scholar informed you that princess evangeline of the northern reaches has been captured by valdis dark wizards you must find her before it is too late
6251343 after defeating one of valdis dark wizards you were able to release princess evangeline now you must journey to snowbrook haven and ensure the protection of the aegis of blindness another piece of the legendary shield of azunai snowbrook haven is under siege by valdis armies so you will have to use an alternate entrance
6251344 the aegis of blindness another piece of the shield of azunai is safely locked away within snowbrook haven however the castle is under heavy siege and the commander needs every bit of help she can get aid the forces to ensure the aegis remains in safe hands
6251345 the occupying morden army has disabled the system of aqueducts bringing water to kalrathia the towns water jars are nearly empty and the townspeoples thirst is sapping their strength and hope you must find a way to restore the kalrathian water supply
6251346 the morden leaders will not be pleased that kalrathia is no longer thirsty you must travel to the morden city of darthrul to head off the attack that will surely come when the morden chief learns of what has transpired hopefully you can distract the morden long enough for the townspeople to organize a rebellion
6251347 your victory within the morden city of darthrul has inspired the townspeople of kalrathia to take up arms against the morden occupiers you must help kalrathia overthrow the morden oppressors
6251348 now that you have helped the kalrathian rebellion defeat the occupying morden army you must turn your will on acquiring the aegis of life the final piece of azunais shield the very fragment you helped valdis acquire during the siege of greilyn beach with the majority of valdis forces committed to his campaign on snowbrook haven there are only the dark wizards to stand in your way and that means you must gain entrance to the mines of kaderak an ancient network of caverns riddled with ley lines this is the source of valdis supply of shards and the area is heavily mined for this purpose
6251349 you have entered the mines of kaderak where the dark wizards live and where the evil crystal shards that produce the shard souls are mined you must destroy the giant shard clusters and locate the dark wizards
6251350 now that you have all four fragments of azunais legendary shield you must make your way to the fabled agallan giants to persuade them to reforge the shield lord kalrathia believes that they can be reached if you are able to get through an ancient chamber beneath the town known as the agallan trial
6251351 the shield of azunai must be reforged if valdis is to be defeated the only beings who have the power to do this are the agallan giants if they truly exist
6251352 valdis and his archmage are leading the armies from within zaramoths horns one of the most secure fortresses built by the followers of zaramoth before the great cataclysm if the agallans are correct you should find valdis and his archmage at the top of the mountain
6251353 it has been a long and challenging journey and you can honestly say you are no longer the same person as you were when you fought for valdis as a mercenary ever since you were taken prisoner by the dryads of eirulan the course of your life has brought you ever closer to this moment you have achieved the impossible found and re united the fragments of the legendary shield of azunai and convinced the agallan giants to reforge it using drevins medallion as a centerpiece you now have the power to defeat valdis and free aranna from his tyranny if you are ready to face the challenge
6251354 you are in a dark tunnel the floor is sticky there are exits to the north east and west what do you want to do

6251360 several things going on at one time is a distraction to cash

6251368 georgia has stood for freedom around the world and now the world must stand for freedom in georgia
6251369 this whole experience is just surreal im at a loss for words to have your kid compete in the olympics is just an unbelievable feeling
6251370 i really am in china bmx really is in the olympics
6251371 her chase of this olympic medal has taken a lot to see her here i cant even explain it weve made it her the sport weve made it now

6251373 freedom can be denied for a while but it cannot be denied forever
6251374 poland has always been a strong defender of freedom even in dark days when it was not able to fully express its desire for freedom
6251375 in troubled times the most important thing is to have friends
6251376 but it is even more important to have friends who share your hopes and aspirations and dreams and poland and the united states are those kinds of friends
6251377 the shield is in fact a sword of the white house and the polish government
6251378 nobody has the right to tell poland what to do times have passed
6251379 they feel that poland is one of their territories and poland is entering their field
6251380 its in polands interest to stay on the american radar to be seen from washington and if we are ever in trouble to hope at least for american support
6251381 we had to do it if only to retain our sovereignty if we had rejected the russians would have interpreted it as a success
6251382 the minute theres a penny raised the minute theres a penny spent itll be reported
6251383 are we going to be out there in full force with a massive campaign absolutely but we are still in the process of planning
6251384 they dont have to actually do it they just have to have the expectation
6251385 that says to me that they have the expectation of receiving contributions or making expenditures
6251386 everything were doing is completely in compliance with the law

6251391 we are against the agreement between unmik and eulex because it violates un security council resolution 1244 and international law
6251392 a profoundly new reality in which unmik can no longer perform as effectively as in the past the vast majority of its tasks as an interim administration
6251393 in order for it to assume an enhanced operational role in kosovo in the area of the rule of law under the overall authority of the united nations
6251394 the serbian government does not accept the reconfiguration of unmik nor the agreement with eulex
6251395 all deals that arent passed by the security council are unacceptable for serbia

6251419 the world is often changed most radically by people who refuse to know their place so called amateurs who refuse to rein in their curiosity or acknowledge areas of expertise have made specialized gatekeepers nervous scornful and defensive since time immemorial upstarts who deny that there are boundaries to knowledge and action who defiantly meld interests and tear down walls are a constant challenge to the status quo
6251420 its important to always keep the big picture in mind and to remain ruthlessly on target
6251421 by all accounts lincoln chafee was an exceedingly nice and kind person no one who dealt with him hated him but the reality was that his presence in the senate especially given his refusal to abandon the republican party enabled a truly reactionary set of people to run this country

6251451 apart from a few matters that we feel we could be swiftly addressed we found no major issue with the sale lease arrangements proposed by the state he said
6251452 we found they were generally consistent with other privatisations and restructures
6251453 we look forward to the release of the report and we hope it will provide a clear path forward and settle any outstanding concerns he told
6251454 its release will also set a test for barry ofarrell who has dithered and delayed and hinged his decision on the recommendations of the report
6251455 well wait and see what the auditor general says but basically if theres any question marks over the deal at all we wont be supporting it
6251456 hes got a pretty narrow terms of reference but i cannot imagine he will be giving it a clean bill of health over every concern people have
6251457 in general terms id say yes that will be the basis

6251459 while we continue to see volatility in international markets and increases in the average cost of long term funding we have experienced some short term funding relief which we are keen to pass on to our customers
6251460 while i am pleased to make todays undertaking our medium and long term funding and our retail deposit base represent the greatest proportion of our funding costs and the average cost of these sources of funding continue to increase
6251461 the recent fall in short term funding costs provides an opportunity to undertake to move rates in line with the rba decision but future interest rate decisions will need to reflect an assessment of all the cost of funding factors
6251462 all australian banks are reliant on offshore funding and increases in the average cost of long term funding are likely to be with us for some time
6251463 therefore any consideration that the federal government can give to enhance the attractiveness of retail bank deposits will help reduce overall funding costs and assist in lowering mortgages rates
6251464 clearly we would love to pass through the full 25 basis points drop if that were to occur but well need to factor in all of those issues at that time

6251467 tapi begitu uang itu tidak di tangan kami maka kami tidak bisa mengawasinya jika kami berikan sendiri yang 5 itu kepada lembaga amal maka kami tahu itu akan berguna untuk tujuan yang positif
6251468 saya akan mempelajari dengan sungguh sungguh rencana bisnis anda entah keputusannya berinvestasi atau tidak ke perusahaan anda tapi fakta bahwa anda membuat komitmen pada amal itu pasti menjadi pertimbangan yang mendukung karena saya kira ini luar biasa

6251480 its a very striking confirmation of something that has been suspected for quite some time
6251481 the placenta is very sensitive to stress hormones in the mother these hormones were probably amplified during the time of the war
6251482 these findings add to a growing literature in experimental animals and humans attributing long term consequences for offspring of maternal gestational stress
6251483 they suggest both a sex specificity and a relatively short gestational time window for gestational effects on vulnerability to schizophrenia
6251484 but women experiencing anxiety or excessive stress would do well to address it before a planned pregnancy and to have good social support systems

6251492 utilizing selective arrests and prosecutions the federal government has sought to sabotage californias reasoned approach to medical marijuana use
6251493 for the first time a court has recognized that a calculated plan by the federal government to undercut state medical marijuana laws is patently unconstitutional todays decision forecasts an end to any organized federal effort to sabotage state medical marijuana laws
6251494 it is obvious to anyone paying attention that federal officials have gone to great lengths to sabotage state efforts to allow for appropriate medical marijuana use
6251495 the court made clear that this deliberate interference once proved would be unequivocally unconstitutional
6251496 the federal government has purposely set out to systematically subvert californias medical marijuana program
6251497 let us hope that this ruling leads to the merciful end of the federal governments cruel war on sick and dying medical marijuana patients
6251498 applied to our situation this means that much as the federal government may prefer that california keep medical marijuana illegal it cannot force the state to do so

6251559 for too long families in new hampshire and across the country have struggled as washington has put the needs of special interests ahead of the needs of middle class families well it is time for a change
6251560 this november we are going to take our country in a new direction by standing up and fighting for the middle class again if we want a new direction in washington we need real change this fall
6251561 there are predictions of reduced snowfalls in that region due to climate variation and often its said that this variations due to human intervention

6251563 on this ecs board i did not get very far with my attempts at overclocking i attribute this to the board only having a 4 pin cpu power connector and a four phase voltage regulator setup i could not get enough clean power through the board to sustain a stable overclock i did get the ecs gf8200a up to 2 94ghz by bumping the cpu frequency up to 210mhz from the stock 200mhz and upping the cpu multiplier to 14x however to do this i had to push the cpu voltage up to 1 55v which is in my opinion the highest i would ever like to see the vcore of a cpu with everything stable at 2 94ghz thats where the overclocking benchmarks will be run

6251566 michelle and i are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of congresswoman stephanie tubbs jones stephanie was an extraordinary american and an outstanding public servant it wasnt enough for her just to break barriers in her own life she was also determined to bring opportunity to all those who had been overlooked and left behind and in stephanie they had a fearless friend and unyielding advocate it was an honor to serve with stephanie in congress and i know her legacy will live on in all those who walk the trails she blazed and walk through the doors she opened our hearts and prayers are with all those who knew and loved her

6251568 ecolleges comprehensive learning platform offers ivy bridge students effective online programs in a reliable course management system
6251569 we offer the best online learning solution in the industry and im confident that this partnership will enable even more tiffin students to achieve their educational goals
6251570 among online associates degree programs i know of no other institution that is offering the degree of support and transferability to every student
6251571 we think todays high school graduates and working professionals are going to find ivy bridge college an affordable and convenient way to obtain a college degree
6251572 algebra doesnt have to be difficult to learn or teach especially when we begin introducing these concepts at an early age
6251573 preparing all students for success in algebra at grade 8 requires a strong early algebra curriculum as well as a curriculum that focuses on developing concepts and skills involving fractions too many students find algebra challenging because of a poor background in fractions envisionmath develops the essential understandings and skills related to fractions needed for success in algebra
6251574 algebra concepts and skills need not be mysterious to teachers or students when they are taught with a focus on sense making furthermore all teachers can successfully teach algebra and all students can successfully learn algebra when teaching and learning are guided by envisionmath
6251575 our elementary grades program reflects the latest research about learning mathematics and already fills a void from an old model that essentially no longer exists
6251576 envisionmath sets a new standard in laying this crucial early foundation for success
6251577 one of the other critical programs we are offering for california is an algebra readiness fixed term course for eighth grade students who are not yet prepared for algebra 1
6251578 virtually all of the research in recent years confirms that in order for our students to compete in the global 21st century economy they simply must improve significantly in their understanding of math concepts and skills
6251579 mathematics is a significant obstacle for many students but this can no longer be acceptable
6251580 algebra readiness is clearly the area where we believe school districts will see the biggest impact for the money they decide to spend on new programs
6251581 it is discouraging that the state budget deficit is keeping some school districts from implementing these new programs at a time when they are most needed
6251582 middle school is what you might call the bermuda triangle of education because a significant percentage of californias kids fall behind and eventually drop out of school at this level
6251583 by focusing on algebra readiness with innovative research based programs with built in intervention and assessment we can not only do a better job of retaining students but also give them the skills and confidence to realize that they can be successful in math
6251584 everybody know about it no matter how good their practice is

6251586 i said to robyn have you thought about how nice it would be to have a space in beijing that was completely dedicated to yoga
6251587 its a place you can go where you can get away from the craziness of beijing
6251588 people come and go a lot in beijing but this communitys been quite steady
6251589 its a yoga thing you meet your edge and you pull back
6251590 it builds your personal flexibility with situations that are beyond your control
6251591 almost every war in american history has inspired valuable innovations in military technology
6251592 s posso concordar com voc daqui a 6 meses porque ir completar 1 ano de fatos esquisitos que ando lendo
6251593 la causa de ello es la falta de autoestima valoraci n dignidad y respeto a s mismo

6251605 hes been part of the family for a long long time
6251606 its just devastating just spare a thought for them the family for the past five weeks theyve had to maintain a vigil against overwhelmning odds of chance of success its terrible
6251607 we challenge you a call to action on global issues
6251608 what were seeing now is a clear regrouping and also again some kind of deception campaign saying look were moving out
6251609 they are going around now and trying to grab new strategic areas in georgia
6251610 we still believe this is not all that this is just a beginning
6251611 dreaming to turn my country into chechnya into some kind of insurgency warfare field where they go around and operate with brutal force
6251612 the last thing im worried about is about my political future right now
6251613 the improved security in iraq allows us to have conversations with the iraqis about setting goals for more american troops to come home and for the iraqis to take the lead in more combat missions
6251614 any dates in an agreement will be based on conditions on the ground because we do not want to lose the hard fought gains of the surge
6251615 we have given ours the other side has given theirs
6251616 hopefully i can make the team if i can play well here this week and next week
6251617 id like to make the team outright i still think i need to play well this week and next week to get a pick i would like to qualify on my own terms
6251618 ive done it in europe and it would be very nice to do it in the states
6251619 hes been through everything and he can help me out when i get nervous and talk to him
6251620 im starting to now know all that stuff like which spot is the best place to be in and around the greens and its helped me play a little bit better each day
6251621 bases loaded right there especially for braden who pitched so well today
6251622 i really cant put it into words weve been down and it seems like when were down were down
6251623 what we have right now is a learning process for a lot of guys when were down we just dont have what it takes to get back into the game
6251624 i dont make a big deal about it because im still pitching
6251625 like frank told me keep putting positive thoughts in your head i feel like my last five outings have been pretty solid
6251626 i was happy with streets outing today he did a very good job
6251627 vivo como si fuera un recluso nadie sabe quien soy
6251628 fue muy breve hablamos tan s lo unos minutos era como una reuni n con un desconocido
6251629 capitol briefing sincerely apologizes for the confusion and will continue to update
6251630 i think theres a lot of soul searching going on here about this
6251631 we want whats the best for caylee we want caylee found
6251632 its not about getting casey out to make sure she feels better
6251633 its all about the interest of finding caylee hopefully she will get us some information
6251634 theres a process in place for the delegates to work on the platform and we are going to let that process work itself out
6251635 i think he would be aborting his own campaign because that is such a critical issue to so many republican voters and the republican brand is already in trouble
6251636 if he doesnt change the platform then hes being the same kind of hypocrite that he accused bush of being in 2000
6251637 but when it comes out that he doesnt want to change this extreme right wing republican platform the word moderate is going to disappear from any description of mccain
6251638 canada is still here today only because we wanted to have our voice decry the attempts at this conference to de legitimize the state of israel and to dishonor the history and suffering of the jewish people
6251639 flauberts observations of jerusalem and the jews living there 1850
6251640 there is not a solitary village throughout its whole extent not for thirty miles in either direction
6251641 israel is like a kid whos parents were burned in the ovens learned martial arts and will defend himself
6251642 global financial markets continue to be fragile and indicators of systemic risks remain elevated the downside risks are leading to a negative feedback loop between the financial system and the broader economy
6251643 the credit crisis stemming from the u s housing slump has triggered a negative feedback loop in the global economy that poses risks for growth
6251644 negative loop between the financial system and the broader economy
6251645 i used to think that mood formed a feedback loop with events which in turn reinforced the mood i have since seen that this idea is erroneous if events formed a feedback loop with mood then social trends would never end each new extreme in mood in a particular direction would cause more reinforcing actions and those actions would reinforce that same mood and so on forever this is an untenable idea
6251646 it would take a major and long lasting shock to upset a financial system that is now capable of riding out the collapse of a hedge fund or even a leading bank
6251647 our daughter and daughter in law have jobs now dont be worried
6251648 what we can do now is to try our very best to build our new homes
6251649 if i was 35 it might be a bigger deal
6251650 i would love to play sure but right now this is more important to me i want to be here with my son and help as much as i would like to play i wouldnt miss this for anything
6251651 when he got into the u s open it automatically qualified him for the u s amateur and i said ill go caddie there
6251652 and at that time i hadnt played very well to even be in the fedexcup i played better after the u s open and got up there
6251653 i dont see how there is any way i wont be passed so it wasnt like this was easy and yet there was no doubt about what i was going to do
6251654 i can talk to him about the shots and what went right and what went wrong and its not like when i get nervous i can talk to him too and hes always handing me food and stuff to keep me energized and stuff like that
6251655 i would like to be able to set a schedule for myself early in the year and get ready for the champions tour
6251656 i still want to play and compete but truthfully the most fun i had this year was at the open i could have finished in the top 10 in the open and not have had as much fun as being caddie for kevin
6251657 it is anticipated the icc task team hook up will take place tomorrow and the icc board hook up will be held on sunday
6251658 poland did very well to come back and played very well defensively but we did well not to lose concentration
6251659 i cant say that we managed to fully cope with the bulgarians especially kaziyski
6251660 in the first set we were just waking up but after that we managed to play collectively
6251661 as for bulgaria they can play one very good game in any tournament and i was praying before the game that it wouldnt be against us
6251662 the guy came out and made the best olympics of my lifetime
6251663 to me bolt is like what michael phelps is to swimming
6251664 at the start of second half we wanted to come out and we had a particular set we wanted to run i had a lot of good looks and knocked them down
6251665 even if i had lost today i think i would have been pretty satisfied with my performance if a bit disappointed
6251666 these are the kind of matches i have been losing in the last year at some point it affects your confidence so to win one like this is good and hopefully i can build from here
6251667 i didnt play any matches for two weeks and i had never played her before so didnt know what to expect
6251668 but it was ok i lost my rhythm a bit on my serve but i fought to the end and i am very pleased with the win
6251669 i have been working really hard and playing well but its very satisfying to see the results coming now
6251670 my first goal is to break into the top 100 then i can set another goal hopefully i can keep going from here
6251671 at 100 kph it is already very fast compared with those in canada and russia which were also built in icy areas but run at 60 to 80 kph
6251672 we know what we need on a global level in terms of reductions
6251673 we cannot continue forever saying this is an issue for the industrial countries and no one else should do anything
6251674 unless we come with a spirit of cooperation trying to resolve things instead of making things more and more complicated
6251675 a lot of governments dont have positions yet and are going through internal processes where ideas are still festering
6251676 we also supervised the construction projects to make sure they meet quake resistant standards
6251677 we are working on a subsidy policy for urban survivors
6251678 but all families that lost their residences in the earthquake will receive subsidies from the government

6251690 you spent the first five years trying to get with the plan
6251691 end goal of life is to live in accordance with god
6251692 i have raced a lot before i know a lot about running
6251693 performing ones art before a crowd is sweet a poison too sweet garnering the attention of every spectator stirring them up enticing them that wildness that excitement the omnipotent feeling of controlling everything once youve tasted it you will not easily forget
6251694 i tend not to think about it beforehand i respect their diving very much i think they deserve a lot of credit
6251695 they have dominated in diving for a while but i dont focus on the dives or the chinese divers i just concentrate on my dives
6251696 they are always great and very respectful i enjoy competing with them
6251697 i am used to it it will not give me too much pressure i am looking forward to the semi final
6251698 guo has been champion for many years and its hard to beat her
6251699 it is my first olympics and i will try to win a medal
6251700 first we want to apologize to nascar all of our partners all of our families at jgr and all of our fans for the unfortunate incident that took place this past weekend in michigan with our two nationwide teams
6251701 in 17 years we have never had any representative of joe gibbs racing knowingly act outside of nascars rules and that is something we consider essential to how we operate on a daily basis
6251702 we take full responsibility and accept the penalties nascar has levied against us today
6251703 we are however disappointed that nascar chose to place our drivers on probation as they had no knowledge or involvement of this incident
6251704 on behalf of everyone at joe gibbs racing we apologize again for this most unfortunate situation
6251705 first and foremost i would like to apologize to the employees and partners of joe gibbs racing because of poor decision making i have failed you as the leader of this team and i am solely responsible for this situation secondly i apologize to the men and women of nascar for my dishonesty and interference during a testing event going forward i will work hard to regain the trust and respect that i once had with the fans nascar and everyone at joe gibbs racing including our drivers who had no knowledge or involvement in this transgression
6251706 i apologize with great remorse for the actions that i took after the michigan race last saturday afternoon my apology is extended to nascar the nascar officials joe and j d gibbs our drivers all of jgrs sponsors and especially to all of the jgr family members that i have misrepresented joe and j d gibbs trust me to lead this race team with honesty and integrity i have failed them and feel great remorse for doing so i accept the penalties imposed by nascar and joe gibbs racing and make no excuses
6251707 over the past several days we have had numerous conversations with joe and j d gibbs relative to the infractions at michigan international speedway in the nationwide series post race inspection
6251708 toyota respects nascars rules and regulations and accepts the sanctions that were imposed against joe gibbs racing it is nascars responsibility to enforce their rules and we respect their decisions toyota always has and will continue to abide by all nascar mandated policies
6251709 in the 17 years in which jgr has been a nascar competitor this is the first time that a jgr crew chief has ever been suspended we are encouraged by the manner that joe and j d have taken responsibility and have quickly imposed their own internal sanctions in an aggressive manner above and beyond the penalties that nascar imposed we applaud their response support their decision and are completely satisfied with their actions in response to this incident
6251710 i verify lies not comely lies meet lowercase lies i started informing them jokes i should call them when i was rattling young
6251711 ive ever had a significance of pander but grouping havent ever mutual it
6251712 i was diagnosed with mbd twice i didnt conceive the prototypal student who told me and i had a full theory that mbd was meet something they invented to attain you clear for penalization but then the ordinal student told me i had it
6251713 i surmisal i was in denial i dont see just what it is the symptoms seem to administer to everyone around me in the business expiration of memory play something and not closing it
6251714 sweetheart revalue it for every its worth because it every changes when you intend into your 30s
6251715 how long did it take you to think up that question
6251716 i will nominate a person to be vice president my running mate who shares my principles my values and my priorities and thats what i can tell you
6251717 president mwanawasa was a true servant of the people who served this country with dignity and honor
6251718 we have lost a great leader who had a real vision for leadership and problems that face the country
6251719 has sunk into such economic difficulties that it may be likened to a sinking titanic whose passengers are jumping out in a bid to save their lives
6251720 he was a very outstanding politician who made a great contribution to his countrys development and regional peace and development
6251721 he attached great importance to zambias relations with china and did a lot for the friendly cooperation between the two countries
6251722 if you want to give it a shot go for it but i think youre going to have a rocky road
6251723 i knew i had to go to college but it wasnt right for me and i wish it didnt stand there as this great promised land that sucked us in

6251725 you will see us dealing with some of these issues when we come back in september
6251726 no one makes advance announcements on things like that we are concentrating on economic issues
6251727 the article he wrote in the guardian was an article that any member of the cabinet could have written or i could have written these are the debates all members of the cabinet have got to be involved in there is no difficulty with that at all
6251728 we are trying to give whatever help we can including talks on reconstruction
6251729 support for the games and engagement with china is not at the expense of human rights
6251730 as for the number of dead we challenge any agency to come and prove the accuracy of the figures published in the western media
6251731 they say 300 000 were killed we ask where are the graves darfur is now open
6251732 since its launch in 1992 the moscow times has been the one indispensable daily newspaper for the english speaking community in the russian capital with its excellent independent reporting of current affairs and outstanding business coverage it makes topical issues both accessible and absorbing the idea of starting the working day without the moscow times would be unthinkable congratulations to the board and staff on fifteen years of achievement and keep up the good work
6251733 it is clear to us and the u s leadership does not deny this that the anti missile defense in europe will broadened and modernized in this case russia will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic demarches
6251734 to freeze all military cooperation with nato and allied countries
6251735 we do not have the means to blow up such a bridge
6251736 time will show it depends on how the political process develops
6251737 we are beginning to see the early signs of some withdrawal
6251738 it is not significant and it needs to increase both the size and pace of the withdrawal needs to increased and needs to increase sooner rather than later
6251739 wahhh dont take pictures of me at a concert for a media conference im hot shit and will break your camera like a five year old if you do
6251740 the challenges for the region is no longer a matter for research or scientific theory and modelling
6251741 the evidence is quite clear that climate change is already wreaking havoc here
6251742 who could have believed that my own country which is so much higher above sea level than many countries in the pacific could be battered by a severe cyclone the way it was in 2004
6251743 we shouldnt wait until a worse human catastrophe occurs before acting and the international attention now focused on climate change presents an opportunity for the region to negotiate and secure tangible assistance for people already affected by climate change
6251744 during his more than four years with the secretariat he managed to raise the secretariat to a new level of credibility and performance
6251745 it is sad that he has passed away but his legacy will live on
6251746 they are responsible for the affairs of their own nations and i think they must not be unnecessarily preoccupied with forum matters
6251747 because of this the essence of delegation and priority setting requires another look by leaders to engage our ministers in decision making and only reserve those matters requiring high level political consideration for the attention of the leaders
6251748 were doing a check now on exactly where we have these bladders and having established that how we would best get them to the site the location and from there how we would best initiate the process
6251749 i still havent had final advice on whether its physically possible theyre getting back to me on that but i have confirmed that there are bladders around its theoretically possible but whether its practically possible im just not sure im still waiting for that additional advice
6251750 certainly defence stands ready to assist in any way we can
6251751 weve pretty much exhausted all the kind of practical options that you could possibly use here
6251752 we do need to be realistic that we are i guess getting towards the end of the process where were trying to balance the whales welfare with any hopes of rescue operations
6251753 from where it is in pittwater the whale actually can communicate quite effectively with the pods of whales going up and down the coast their sounds travel kilometres under water
6251754 but that communication obviously has not resulted in anything useful in the last few days so its increasingly clear that the wild whales are not interested in looking after colin for whatever reason
6251755 every other option needs to be explored and its got to be realistic
6251756 its great to have all these ideas of being able to do things but its got to be realistic and its got to be achievable the worst thing you could do is to prolong suffering with the animal no one wants to see that happen at all

6251907 the recent fall in short term funding costs provides an opportunity to undertake to move rates in line with the rba decision but future interest rate decisions will need to reflect an assessment of all the cost of funding factors
6251908 all australian banks are reliant on offshore funding and increases in the average cost of long term funding are likely to be with us for some time
6251909 therefore any consideration that the federal government can give to enhance the attractiveness of retail bank deposits will help reduce overall funding costs and assist in lowering mortgages rates

6251990 theresa and i were shocked and saddened to hear of stephanie tubbs jones untimely passing this news breaks our hearts stephanie combined the best of heart head and spirit she was a pioneer who led the way as the first african american woman from ohio to be elected to congress when she was on your side she was there all the way we spent so many days together in 2004 and our friendship endured she was one of a kind the genuine article we are praying for her family and loved ones

6251992 congresswoman tubbs jones was an outstanding friend and an amazingly productive congresswoman for our city and greater cleveland she never shied from difficult issues and in fact she led on them locally i believe that her support for pro equality positions directly propelled the passage of legislation which has positively impacted our families
6251993 michelle and i are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of congresswoman stephanie tubbs jones stephanie was an extraordinary american and an outstanding public servant it wasnt enough for her just to break barriers in her own life she was also determined to bring opportunity to all those who had been overlooked and left behind and in stephanie they had a fearless friend and unyielding advocate it was an honor to serve with stephanie in congress and i know her legacy will live on in all those who walk the trails she blazed and walk through the doors she opened our hearts and prayers are with all those who knew and loved her
6251994 we are greatly saddened about the passing of congresswoman tubbs jones
6251995 this is a great loss for our party and our nation on behalf of the democratic party we extend our thoughts and prayers to congresswoman tubbs jones friends and family during this difficult time
6251996 the first step us blows open contentious game against aussies
6251997 thy kingdom come and thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven
6251998 if you are sincere in regarding me as your mother and father what are you are you not my sons and daughters are you conducting yourselves in accordance with that status are you behaving like brothers and sisters in the organisation

6252001 there are significant competition problems arising from baas common ownership of seven uk airports this is evident from its lack of responsiveness to the needs of its airline customers and a lack of initiative in planning capacity
6252002 by calling not just for a fundamental restructure of baa but also for a review of the governments air transport white paper the commission risks delaying that delivery of new runways and making better customer service less not more likely
6252003 we are delighted by the decision which we have been calling for years
6252004 stephanie repeatedly demonstrated her friendship on the floor of the u s house of representatives where she was a boisterous eloquent and effective voice for equality voting rights and democratic values
6252005 our organization was proud to call her a champion and so many of our members were blessed to call her a friend
6252006 congresswoman tubbs jones was an outstanding friend and an amazingly productive congresswoman for our city and greater cleveland she never shied from difficult issues and in fact she led on them locally i believe that her support for pro equality positions directly propelled the passage of legislation which has positively impacted our families
6252007 the lesbian gay bisexual and transgender community has not just lost an ally but a friend
6252008 representative tubbs jones could always be counted on to speak out for civil rights and was an outspoken advocate for lgbt equality she will be greatly missed
6252009 while we continue to see volatility in international markets and increases in the average cost of long term funding we have experienced some short term funding relief which we are keen to pass on to our customers
6252010 while i am pleased to make todays undertaking our medium and long term funding and our retail deposit base represent the greatest proportion of our funding costs and the average cost of these sources of funding continue to increase
6252011 the recent fall in short term funding costs provides an opportunity to undertake to move rates in line with the rba decision but future interest rate decisions will need to reflect an assessment of all the cost of funding factors
6252012 all australian banks are reliant on offshore funding and increases in the average cost of long term funding are likely to be with us for some time
6252013 therefore any consideration that the federal government can give to enhance the attractiveness of retail bank deposits will help reduce overall funding costs and assist in lowering mortgages rates
6252014 clearly we would love to pass through the full 25 basis points drop if that were to occur but well need to factor in all of those issues at that time she told an investor briefing
6252015 dr ben cunneen hes been a very valuable employee with us for quite a long time dr lovell said on abc radio
6252016 he was the first person who became infected in this outbreak and hes been very very seriously ill in hospital
6252017 i just spare a thought for them for the last five weeks i guess it is theyve virtually had to maintain a vigil with him against overwhelming odds of any chance of success it is terrible
6252018 hes been like part of the family for a long long time
6252019 i think weve got some good news there i think shes doing quite well
6252020 people are confused and lethargic not simply because they are tired of hearing the gospel or because they have never really been emotionally gripped by it but also because they are confused they have not heard the gospel in a way that provokes a thoughtful basement to attic reappraisal of themselves and their world
6252021 hes the only one who has a shot at creating a production studio
6252022 the challenge for me is taking all these parts and figuring out how they can come together to make a big media company

6252025 bush recently restated his goal to transform iraq into democratic capitalist modernity much as germany and japan had been transformed during the military occupations that followed their defeat in world war ii but iraq is an arab country and no arab country has yet been able to consolidate democracy and that includes jordan and lebanon the two that are most developed literacy rates illustrate the difficulty of modernizing iraq in 2003 04 57 percent of women in 15 arab countries were literate world bank data show just 30 percent of iraqi females as literate in 2003 and of course democratization in iraq is vastly complicated by the longstanding hostility between the majority shiite and the minority sunni and between those two arab sects and the iraqi kurds by contrast germany and japan were highly developed industrial nations with fully integrated and educated populaces and their governments had both surrendered unconditionally

6252031 as host plans well provide our medical care provider networks and our discounts continue to reimburse providers and continue to determine claims pricing
6252032 we regularly assess the quality and costs of the health care plans offered by our providers including those plans owned by health care service corp and we dont have any changes to those plans to announce at this time

6252053 i live here on less than a dollar a month
6252054 we can no longer take our extensive water supplies for granted
6252055 canada lacks sound information at a national scale on the major uses and user s of water
6252056 national forecasting of water availability has never been done because traditionally our use of the resource was thought to be unlimited
6252057 our lack of data places canada at strategic disadvantage for bilateral negotiations with the u s
6252058 never before in the history of our energy industry have we taken the bold steps that we are taking today
6252059 we the people of newfoundland and labrador are stepping forward and proudly taking our place as full partners and active participants in energy resource development
6252060 whether they paid too high a price to get into this project remains to be seen
6252061 the coffee is cold and the donuts are stale by the time information gets down to the end of the table
6252062 this is a significant piece of work that could create millions of person hours of employment
6252063 the fuselage is destroyed the plane burned i have seen a kilometre of charred land and few whole pieces of the fuselage it is all destruction
6252064 i was deeply saddened to learn of the dreadful loss of life in todays aircraft crash at barajas airport in madrid the news of which has shocked us all
6252065 i live here on less than a dollar a month
6252066 i live here on less than a dollar a month
6252067 i live here on less than a dollar a month
6252068 theres only one acre here but its pretty intense we grow a lot of different products on this one acre everything from horseradish to strawberries and we have ocra blooming right now so its a pretty wide variety

6252071 i live here on less than a dollar a month
6252072 i decided to find a better way to react to frivolous lawsuits than just being reactive
6252073 if you think of the litigation cycle as a sandwich
6252074 then were the two pieces of bread and the medical malpractice attorney is the meat in the middle before a case ever gets started you first try to prevent it and then set up an infrastructure to enable viable countersuits down the road
6252075 theres no basis for suing someone for suing you if they have a legitimate complaint
6252076 if an attorney brings a suit without basis he can be sanctioned by the courts but that rarely happens
6252077 but now the fish have uzis were arming the fish
6252078 then north carolina is a pretty good place to be
6252079 medical justice is just another option for physicians trying to navigate a rough malpractice environment
6252080 its hard to tell from their website what they can do and cant do
6252081 in north carolina they cant do a countersuit against a plaintiff or a plaintiffs lawyer sometimes physicians after the case is over and theyve been sued will make a case against the expert but thats something thats relatively new within the last five years
6252082 rating a doctor is harder than rating a toaster or a car because patients comes in all flavors
6252083 the risk you run is getting doctors who try to game the system by choosing only patients who are healthy and easy to treat
6252084 if they figured that out they ought to patent it and can it and bottle it and sell it because it would be very valuable
6252085 era td normal que so sao 2 assaltos por mes

6252087 what the mortality rate does is give you an entree to talk to your doctor and say look is this hospital stay going to kill me
6252088 the problem with the cms data is that most hospitals look average which isnt what employers want what they want is to compare hospitals
6252089 when your numbers arent what you like them to be its not because you didnt have the same patients as the hospital across the street
6252090 its because you didnt do as well as you could with the hand you were dealt
6252091 this is turning the lights on for providers of care as well
6252092 doctors and hospitals cant decide to do better unless they know how theyre doing
6252093 if we fall back a bit or if were not making progress
6252094 they want to know what were going to do about it
6252095 theres no one thing that determines whether you save a life
6252096 we learned that if we lock down our elevators when we know a patients coming we can save three or four minutes
6252097 this was a signal that we have to be responsible for patients after theyve left our halls
6252098 i cant give anything away but this series has a lot of surprises in store for viewers
6252099 eve is great so easy to work with shes lovely and good fun on set but a true professional too
6252100 what makes our job so much easier is that the people of cardiff are so supportive
6252101 the businesses around this area could make things difficult for filming but they are being so cooperative
6252102 is that our red post box or is it a real one
6252103 i usually give you all one or two tone words when we have a meeting like this but if i were to give you two words this time they would be euros lyn
6252104 more than ever before this series of torchwood will be director led and it will look absolutely amazing
6252105 i cant give anything away but this series has a lot of surprises in store for viewers
6252106 eve is great so easy to work with shes lovely and good fun on set but a true professional too
6252107 what makes our job so much easier is that the people of cardiff are so supportive

6252111 more than ever before this series of torchwood will be director led and it will look absolutely amazing
6252112 we cant come to terms with what weve gone through
6252113 it feels unreal within a day my wife and i show up at the hospital our daughter is born and declared dead later we find out she is still alive and a few hours later we are told again that she is dead
6252114 i showed up at the intensive care unit and saw that she was dead my wife will suffer from this and well have to deal with it im sure shell need psychological help
6252115 we are very excited to offer shattered suns available for digital distribution on the day that the game releases into retail
6252116 by providing gamers the ability to purchase through direct2drive we are working with a trusted leader in the industry giving our fans the best experience possible in downloading our games
6252117 i never thought pamba would actually make it this far in the competition but we are thrilled she has
6252118 she has an incurable disease contracted from proto theca a type of algae found in puddles grass and ponds which is extremely rare and is always fatal
6252119 but not only has she lived far longer than anyone dared hope she also puts up with horrible treatment while staying happy and cheerful she really is a joy
6252120 it really is awful dogs suffer terrible diarrhoea often blindness and eventually organ failure usually followed by death within a few months of diagnosis
6252121 but pamba is a fighter she has had this disease for two and half years but she is not blind and she is very much alive she is a heroine
6252122 its not important that pamba wins she is already a winner to me
6252123 the worst 12 months of inflation in almost three decades
6252124 almost everything costs more even as americans have less money to pay for it
6252125 cost of food is rising food prices are quickly increasing and even school lunches across the country expensive in the coming year
6252126 optimism in the u s economy among ceos of the nations fastest growing private companies
6252127 as an expression of somebody who calls himself a minister of health its a very unhealthy statement
6252128 i mean where does he come off where does he appoint himself as a moral judge of professionals who he doesnt understand and knows nothing about
6252129 is it unethical for health care professionals to support the administration of drugs that are of unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed
6252130 so contrary to what mr clement might think were actually encouraging abstinence
6252131 my question to him is how does it affect you on a personal level that you should be so lacking in compassion for people
6252132 people have realized that when addiction touches their own lives in particular they realize that they really need a tool kit to help an addict and it should include injection sites
6252133 i almost feel a certain amount of pity for the guy clement because i think he doesnt seem to grasp just how sophisticated the level of discussion has been thats gone on around ethics
6252134 to just suddenly enter into the level hes entered this and think that he can sway the canadian medical association people with a few comments i think is very naive of him
6252135 too many canadians have seen the ugly face of drug crime
6252136 theyve had junkies break into their homes to fund a quick fix theyve seen young thugs dealing in schoolyards and getting more kids hooked
6252137 youre going to run with your cell phone and your credit card do not lose those
6252138 e o rei da s ria fazia guerra a israel e consultou com os seus servos dizendo em tal e tal lugar estar o meu acampamento mas o homem de deus enviou ao rei de israel dizendo guarda te de passares por tal lugar porque os s rios desceram ali por isso o rei de israel enviou quele lugar de que o homem de deus lhe dissera e de que o tinha avisado e se guardou ali n o uma nem duas vezes ent o se turbou com este incidente o cora o do rei da s ria chamou os seus servos e lhes disse n o me fareis saber quem dos nossos pelo rei de israel e disse um dos servos n o rei meu senhor mas o profeta eliseu que est em israel faz saber ao rei de israel as palavras que tu falas no teu quarto de dormir e ele disse vai e v onde ele est para que envie e mande traz lo e fizeram lhe saber dizendo eis que est em dot ent o enviou para l cavalos e carros e um grande ex rcito os quais chegaram de noite e cercaram a cidade e o servo do homem de deus se levantou muito cedo e saiu e eis que um ex rcito tinha cercado a cidade com cavalos e carros ent o o seu servo lhe disse ai meu senhor que faremos e ele disse n o temas porque mais s o os que est o conosco do que os que est o com eles e orou eliseu e disse senhor pe o te que lhe abras os olhos para que veja e o senhor abriu os olhos do mo o e viu e eis que o monte estava cheio de cavalos e carros de fogo em redor de eliseu

6252140 its tough when one of your starters goes down and you have to put a new guy in
6252141 the critical problem in the murray darling basin is one that no government can easily fix
6252142 in an age of climate change and during a prolonged drought we simply have less water in the basin
6252143 part of trying to deal with that is the water buyback and the problem with queensland is dealt with by the fact that of the 400 million we have reserved as part of the buyback 350 million is being reserved for queensland
6252144 the nature of the water system is that the further south you go the tougher people tend to be doing it right through until you reach the end of the system in south australia
6252145 so i can absolutely understand the frustration that so many farmers feel and the water that they know would produce a profitable crop in a properly irrigated area simply isnt available on zero allocations
6252146 heres a hint dont let yourself lead a team its curtains baby

6252156 lack strictly enforced measures to eliminate dog rabies or an ample supply of modern cell culture vaccines for humans
6252157 in china human rabies was largely under control in the period 1990 1996 owing to nationwide rabies vaccination programs
6252158 the recent increase in incidence has been high enough to trigger a warning sign for control and prevention
6252159 the kind of stress in question are those that would be experienced in a natural disaster such as an earthquake or hurricane a terrorist attack or a sudden bereavement
6252160 it is a very striking confirmation of something that has been suspected for a long time
6252161 the placenta is very sensitive to stress hormones in the mother these hormones were probably amplified during the time of the war
6252162 there is overwhelming experimental evidence that stress to pregnant mammals alters neurodevelopment in the offspring and affects their subsequent behavior both in childhood and as adults
6252163 the knowledge that maternal stress affects the fetus has important implications for mental health in a world threatened by acute violence and war

6252169 theres already been things out there in the media hes already made up his mind hes going to announce on such and such a day
6252170 i have not made the decision and were in the process and if i say anything more than that i guarantee you theres going to be another one of these firestorms obviously were going to be announcing soon because we have no choice but ive got to tell you its one of the toughest things ive ever done
6252171 i think he knows how to reach across party lines the same way massachusetts gov mitt romney former budget director rob portman and ridge a new reuters zogby poll gave mccain a 5 point national lead over obama wiping out the s 7 point advantage in july and giving mccain his first lead in the reuters zogby poll and one of his few leads in any poll two other polls showed the race tightening with a wall street journal nbc news poll giving obama a 3 point edge down from 6 points last month and a cbs new york times poll also giving obama a 3 point edge down from 6 points two weeks ago mccain has been gaining on obama in polls over the last few weeks after repeatedly criticizing the democrats experience opposition to most new and credentials as a commander in chief he renewed his attacks on obama for supporting a 16 month timetable to withdraw combat troops from iraq and criticized obamas suggestion he had questioned obamas patriotism got a little testy on this issue he said im questioning his patriotism
6252172 let me be very clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgment
6252173 one of the least experienced candidates for president in the last 100 years
6252174 it is my hope that fidelity will follow the industry trend and promptly repurchase these securities that it has sold to its customers many of whom now find themselves unable to access money that they thought was as liquid as cash
6252175 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
6252176 reclaiming public spaces as a space for public imagination and enlightenment where they have become propagandistic barriers to thought and awareness
6252177 i never think that people die they just go to department stores

6252180 from the day schumers letter was made public on june 26 until the closure of the bank a run on the bank took place and the failure became inevitable
6252181 the difference in mood between the liberal blogosphere and the conservative blogosphere is striking
6252182 the democratic campaign in the fall is going to have to be much much tougher than the summer campaign was
6252183 celebrities like to spend their millions barack obama is no different only its your money he wants to spend
6252184 and methodically tore into mccains health care tax and offshore oil drilling policies
6252185 i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
6252186 sen obama got a little testy on this issue he said i was questioning his patriotism let me be clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgment
6252187 the bottom line is that sen obamas words for all their eloquence and passion dont mean all that much
6252188 has a real curiosity about the world who loves life and can find passion in lifes smallest moments
6252189 the children delivered via gestational surrogacy are healthy and already under rickys full time care
6252190 ricky is elated to begin this new chapter in his life as a parent and will be spending the remainder of the year out of the public spotlight in order to spend time with his children
6252191 an epic of a woman not in all the ages has there been one like unto it fuller of romance than works of fiction are the lives of the mormon women so strange and thrilling is their story so rare in its elements of experience that neither history nor fable affords a perfect example yet it is a reality of our own times women with new types of character antique rather than modern themes ancient but transposed to our latter day experience women with their eyes open and the prophecy of their work and mission in their own utterances who have dared to enter upon the path of religious empire founding with as much divine enthusiasm as had the apostles who founded christendom such are the mormon women religious empire founders in faith and fact
6252192 i give thanks to god that he has made me a woman i give thanks to my creator that he has made me black that he has fashioned me as i am with hands heart head to serve my people it can it should be a glorious thing to be a woman it is important for women to stand together and rise together to meet our common enemies illiteracy poverty crime disease and stupid unjust laws that have made women feel so helpless as to be hopeless
6252193 that is how i joined the church i feel that i became involved with the church by being involved with the people my country is a county of many problems some known to you there have been quite a few unpleasant times 1976 for example which found soweto her hometown most unhappy as a result of riots against changes in the educational system that was one of the most challenging times of my life to see what we called schools going up in flames what we called libraries being battered down and worse still the waste of all that young talent when the education programs ceased all of what i would call our treasure was being destroyed later strikes saw parents out of work which made things worse for many families
6252194 i am grateful to the lord that something was touched in me at that time i developed a plan to try and help the young people and my plan was to try and engage the hand to engage the mind with nothing to start with i asked for the use of an abandoned churchyard it was infested with rodents it was covered with waste i was allowed to use it i collected the little children from four to ten years old to go into that churchyard and start gardens i have always fond pleasure in a garden at times as a mother is isnt possible to get away from the family when some annoyance comes up but if you can go into the garden i can assure you brothers and sisters its such a beautiful place when you break up the soil you feel you own heart melting and by the time you have done a little work often you forget what had disturbed you
6252195 so i taught my little ones at that time as we were dealing with the lumps of dirt that these lumps could be overcome if we worked them with the knowledge that we were preparing to get something out of the soil and when we began putting in the little plants i would say to the children you see now the trouble you perhaps see at home cover it with the soil like were doing with the plants see what good things you can grow if you nurse this little patch i could see us all begin to feel more peaceful more at ease though i too had be tense and frightened to speak of anything positive during the days of unrest when we were starting those gardens
6252196 where there was a blood stain a beautiful flower must grow
6252197 the spiritual part of being relief society president i find difficult i am not experienced enough to have all the wisdom and answers for everybody but i do enjoy trying to make the organization more functional to have better socials better visiting teaching when the bishop asked me what one thing i wanted to learn from being relief society president i said it was to have a love for the sisters im not one to go up and put my arm around somebody not that i dont think about it but some people can do that more naturally working with people has made me more understanding i dont get to do everything i want to do but we have to realize that the gospel is whats true its the gospel that is why people join the church
6252198 i will nominate a person to be vice president my running mate who shares my principles my values and my priorities and thats what i can tell you
6252199 and as long as you didnt get pulled over youd be safe anyway because the cops never go out looking for failure to appear suspects

6252283 republican party of minnesota to offer prize to anyone who can get frankens accountant to explain frankens taxes prior to 2003
6252284 for months al franken has avoided answering questions about back taxes owed to other states prior to 2003 with his accountant being instructed not to speak to the press now that franken seems to have lifted the gag order on his accountant the republican party of minnesota will be offering a prize to anyone who can get al franken or his accountant explain where specifically franken earned income and where he paid taxes from 1991 2003
6252285 in financial disclosure forms that franken filed last year with the u s senate he listed a salary of just over 1 million from alan franken inc the corporation set up in 1991 provides frankens services and collects fees and residuals for his work
6252286 contacted at his long island apartment chanzis declined to discuss frankens statements that the accountants mistakes caused frankens taxes to go unpaid in 17 states
6252287 meanwhile sheehan called on franken to make his accountant available to discuss frankens well documented tax problems franken paid 70 000 in back taxes to 17 states saying his accountant had reported the income elsewhere andy barr the franken spokesman said that franken has not instructed his accountant not to talk
6252288 franken said he would not release his income tax returns for those years
6252289 al franken he gave speeches across the country says the announcer in the al franken for senate ad instead of paying taxes in the states where he spoke he overpaid taxes to the state where he lived it was an honest mistake in fact franken wont make tax returns public so theres no way to verify if he overpaid home state taxes he blames an accountants error for mistakenly paying 917 000 in taxes to new york and minnesota but he did not pay taxes due in 17 other states franken reimbursed those states with 70 000 and says he expects refunds at home

6252300 after five years of hard work and important collaboration with our stakeholders we are so pleased that this one of a kind south suburban development will be having its grand opening this thursday its been a while in the making but the actual quality of the development from its impressive amenity package to its cutting edge energy saving features have made it well worth the wait we know there is great enthusiasm and anticipation among families looking for quality affordable rental housing in riverdale because we have been flooded with calls and inquiries we look forward to officially opening our doors to the community this week
6252301 this initial investment was critical in securing additional funding for the development and has helped to bring affordable housing to residents and also helped to revitalize the village of riverdale
6252302 this is the largest low interest loan the treasurers office has ever obtained for a community development project which speaks volumes about our commitment to the revitalizing struggling neighbors
6252303 whistler crossing brings together low and moderate income residents and raises the standard of living by offering modern amenities such as internet access and energy efficient appliances to all residents this has the potential to be a model for future affordable housing developments
6252304 the development of the pacesetter community is very important for the village of riverdale and also for the region this is key in moving forward and we are ecstatic that finally after years of effort all our hard work has come to fruition
6252305 the county is excited about the opportunity that this development presents for the south suburban citizens we look forward to working with the community on future phases of this impressive new development

6252404 do you see these screws we will screwem all four into your ass if you are using hacked version of adobe cs3
6252405 use the right mental triggers to make sure you give something of value rather than inane pushy updates remember an over dosage of any social marketing tool can have a negative marketing effect as well so its all about striking a comfortable balance

6252415 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on
6252416 if theyre only testing for a third of the list of banned steroids it does raise one question whats the point
6252417 i think its too early to talk to the uil about whether we need to make any changes to the program
6252418 well look at all the factors including if we need to test more students well also consider changes to the panel of steroids that are tested
6252419 casting a broader net over more students would probably take some precedence over
6252420 we wanted to make sure that we entered into this the right way to send the right message to our athletes
6252421 if high school kids were smart and knew how to use the internet this kind of testing would prove to be pretty weak
6252422 most know ahead of time that only championship teams are tested and none of them have what i would consider a solid program
6252423 they can then choose a testing panel which is in the best interests of their program
6252424 our deepest sympathy is extended to the persons family friends and work colleagues
6252425 its really not a bad tree maybe it just needs a little love
6252426 a true champion is someone who wants to make a difference who never gives up and who gives everything she has no matter what the circumstances are a true champion works hard and never loses sight of her dreams

6252429 there was a feasible low cost alternative which did not involve any increased risk to safety to provide him with training on the new hse system instruct him on how to complete the necessary forms and assist him with the duties such as writing statements and reports which he was unable to perform
6252430 an employer must ensure the health safety and welfare at work of all the employees of the employer
6252431 an employer must so far as is reasonably practicable c provide information to employees of the employer in such other languages as appropriate concerning health and safety at the workplace
6252432 that is true but i hope we all die of old age
6252433 youre not supposed to hope we die were your kids
6252434 as criminals exploit technology to commit their crimes whether it be identity theft money laundering distribution of child pornography or any other criminal conduct law enforcement will quickly react to develop equally sophisticated means to track down their wrongdoing
6252435 there is perhaps nothing more reprehensible than an act in exploitation of children those members of our society who because of their age and inexperience are especially vulnerable to manipulation and deceit americas children are its most cherished and valuable resource the fbi will continue to do all that it can to protect them from those that would rob them of their innocence
6252436 today those involved in child exploitation like everyone else are using the remarkable reach of the internet and peer to peer technology is the latest frontier but we have a message for child sex predators who think they can escape justice by hiding in cyberspace we will do everything in our power and use every tool at our disposal to keep our children safe whether they are around the block or around the world
6252437 this is a patch i created using my new doepfer modular synthesizer
6252438 the best synth site on the web always updated always interesting

6252444 vigorous enforcement of the laws controlling arms export and trafficking is of the highest priority for the department of justice and is part of our duty to protect national security and the nations defense system both the indictment and the guilty pleas by agt reflect the departments efforts to combat illegal exports where ever it may happen whether it is here locally or overseas
6252445 ok guys listen up because i dont think you took me serioiusly yesterday let me tell you something
6252446 because that word sends a negative message to your subconscious to the back of your head when you hear it your brain starts to think ok maybe i cant do this when your brain hears that enough times guess what it starts to believe it then it leads to a whole bunch of other things you start to doubt yourself you start to believe that you really cant do something it gets worse because of that you get frustrated you get mad whenever theres a challenge then when your brain has heard it enough times you get super angry and you just stop trying altogether you quit and down the line guess what happens you quit dance all because you told yourself i cant
6252447 but thats the big boobytrap of creator owned books especially in the indie market your biggest obstacles to success will be promotion and distribution because marvel and dc dominate the distribution food chain and no smaller company has a particularly good promotional apparatus if they have any at all

6252461 there is no indication of any change in the near future regarding the current state of competition market forces have not yet met the challenge of controlling price increases
6252462 a government big enough to give you everything you want is strong enough to take everything you have
6252463 you cannot escape the responsibility of tomorrow by evading it today
6252464 if i can go out there and have nothing and get away with five innings and the bullpen does what they do and we get a win
6252465 we had our opportunity we had a walk hit batter bunt single and the bases loaded with nobody out and two pitches later the innings over weve got to score there somehow
6252466 gagne got the bases loaded and out of it all on eight pitches

6252468 this conference is a tremendous opportunity for those serving in and supporting our air force to meet and share their knowledge and ideas
6252469 air force professional organizations are important to airmen their families and the mission
6252470 these organizations enhance the professional development of our airmen and provide visibility for our air space and cyberspace missions at regional and local levels around the nation
6252471 bringing together first sergeants from bases around the globe enhances cross communication to enlisted leaders who are key to the morale welfare and leadership of our airmen
6252472 subject matter experts and leaders brief active duty reserve and guard first sergeants on updates to issues and challenges surrounding our enlisted force and their families
6252473 by bringing our senior enlisted leaders together to participate in discussions and hear briefers from across the air force spectrum we better enable our senior enlisted leaders to address air force focus areas from a timely and relevant perspective
6252474 its really neat that airmen can brush elbows with leaders like the chief master sergeant of the air force and former chief master sergeants of the air force
6252475 to hear them speak to sit in the same room with them really motivates you and charges you up to go out and do a better job
6252476 afsa works for us they fight for our pay raises our education and healthcare benefits and many of the other things we need we should really support them
6252477 wave power has the potential to provide a large portion of the worlds electric energy needs if it can be tapped in an efficient way
6252478 this effort really exemplifies how the three alcs by working together as a team can rapidly respond to almost any warfighter need
6252479 this is the way of the future and we can see it from where we sit today
6252480 we notified them of this particular project and the urgency of it and they all marched out and did their jobs they executed to get the part prototyped and in production in record time
6252481 it gives us the opportunity to showcase what were about and what we can do especially our rapid manufacturing capabilities
6252482 every environment is different the resources are different what you can use and what the people will accept is even different
6252483 even if you discover something that has already been done you have to figure out how to get it accepted here you have to be able to work with people on a human level those were our challenges in the beginning we realized early that half of our job was going to be to sell the solution
6252484 when i was at physician assistant school i never even considered that i would do anything like this
6252485 the reality of it is when you get out into your job you have to look around in the environment to find out what the problems are and decide how you re going to fix them
6252486 when we got here all we could see is what we could not do
6252487 we had to learn and accept what we could do and do it to the best of our ability once we got to that phase we took off like a runaway train it almost got simpler when we took a step back you cant solve all of these childrens individual medical problems but you can tackle very simple things that is going to impact a lot of people
6252488 once we convinced them to taste it they realized it was a good thing and they all gave their verbal pledge which is a big deal
6252489 they all stood up and agreed that their village and their families would use it
6252490 everything that we are doing goes back to clean their water
6252491 we are really trying to get to the lowest common denominator with everything
6252492 we are using this particular recipe because there is no cooking required
6252493 the types of ingredients we are using are not water based so this can stand on a shelf without refrigeration for four months this really works perfectly it wont go bad it wont cause disease and it wont cause sickness
6252494 we can teach them to make this the materials are here in the country and they can sustain this they just need to know how to do it and know that it exists
6252495 the children dont have to actually chew it they can suck on it they dont have to have a lot of strength or teeth
6252496 good communication ensures the air force efficiently uses each seat in its formal training program and in doing so prepares airmen for mission requirements both on station and at deployed locations
6252497 in addition it also helps air force schools maintain enough seats for future training needs
6252498 afpc has the capability to cancel a training line number up to 24 hours prior to a class start date wed prefer to have at least 10 duty days advanced notice as this would allow us time to re advertise the opening to the rest of the career field and find another individual to attend
6252499 if dark knight failed to perform way above expectations this would have been a decidedly down summer
6252500 ricky is elated to begin this new chapter in his life as a parent and will be spending the remainder of the year out of the public spotlight in order to spend time with his children
6252501 families are continuing to discover that kansas city irish fest makes for a really fun and affordable close to home vacation
6252502 we are doing everything we can to make irish fest an ever better experience for everybody
6252503 theres a whole set of factors that go into the ultimate cost of energy
6252504 the best that can be said about these ideas is that theyre pandering
6252505 far worse theyre distractions from the deadly serious business of creating a new national energy policy
6252506 we need a call to action not a call to go to another conference
6252507 and from a side on profile eva appeared to sport a small bump leading onlookers to believe the star could indeed be expecting her first child the newspaper reported
6252508 i hid near him if i feel frightened ill always run to him tonys a friendly giant but i wouldnt mess with him
6252509 i just dont think it will go that far i think orbit and the lender will work out their differences in time
6252510 someone with the authority to stop it says it has to stop
6252511 on hold until the receivership situation changes and the lawsuit with the lender is resolved
6252512 later today market participants will pay close attention to the weekly us fuel inventories report

6252517 he probably should be higher but his playcalling bores the shit out of me and everybody knows that david cutcliffe was the glue holding it all together right right seriously though he won a bcs title but he might be the worst head coach to win one in our time
6252518 hell yeah we did 11 and we beet ur ass 2 lol
6252519 perhaps the biggest factor keeping the presidential race close has been obamas inability to close the deal with some of hillary clintons supporters
6252520 drogba will not be back before a month a month and a half
6252521 he has started to run but he will not be available for the match against mozambique a 2010 fifa world cup qualifier 5 september
6252522 in autumn there will be news from liberty city the first episodes of gta iv will be available for download exclusively on xbox live underlining xbox 360s leadership role in the field of digital entertainment
6252523 capitol briefing sincerely apologizes for the confusion and will continue to update
6252524 i think theres a lot of soul searching going on here about this
6252525 vamos a volver guatemaltecos a los gringos de tantos goles
6252526 all i can do is be me whoever that is
6252527 it is only a matter of time before the growing army of unemployed and underemployed turns from restless to violent
6252528 the situation in the pacific is a complex and long standing one while its easy to point at the problems its far harder to offer up workable solutions
6252529 about 80 percent of the pacifics population growth is found in the low growth group of islands where employment is rare and living standards are not rising
6252530 but even high guest worker numbers of 50 000 a year for australia and 25 000 for new zealand would not help the employment problems of papua new guinea fiji and the solomon islands
6252531 for exactly the sort of reasons that are highlighted in this report
6252532 its been a recognised fact that good governance relies on well educated civil servants in pacific states and working on raising education standards from the bottom up is a way of bringing about that
6252533 these are big issues that cant be sold overnight even by chucking twice as much money at them they require long term planning and implementation of projects
6252534 for example the work being done in education now isnt going to reap benefits for many many years but we accept that
6252535 our strategy centres on helping pacific partners to create an environment which supports sustainable economic growth delivering long term benefits
6252536 we want whats the best for caylee we want caylee found
6252537 its not about getting casey out to make sure she feels better
6252538 its all about the interest of finding caylee hopefully she will get us some information
6252539 he didnt exercise sufficient care in his work with the office to avoid getting in a mess like that
6252540 if dark knight failed to perform way above expectations this would have been a decidedly down summer
6252541 they may not hesitate for one second to spend 10 bucks on a movie ticket to go see the dark knight but some of these other films they may say oh im going to wait or im going to be a little bit more careful with my spending
6252542 this improved performance came from our operations in new zealand and the united states of america
6252543 while established customer tonnage trades at similar levels to the prior period this increased market share has provided good growth during challenging economic conditions
6252544 we remain cautiously optimistic about our performance for the remainder of the year

6252547 this is a very exciting time for ritemade and our customers its important that we continue to invest in the latest most cost efficient equipment so that our customers have the tools to increase their business
6252548 my personal dream came true late last year when a group led by roger kornberg at stanford university made a breakthrough experiment determining the atomic structure of gold nanoparticles of a certain size the structure resembled the prediction our research group had already earlier published in the recent study we were able to comprehend why nature generates exactly these kinds of particles the size of one particle is 1 3 nanometers and since they behave in many respects like giant atoms we call them superatoms in our study
6252549 our study would not have been possible without the extensive high performance computing resources of the national it centres of finland germany and sweden the study took up quite a lot of computation time but it was well worth the effort i believe that our theoretical model on the stability of the gold nanoparticles will prove itself very useful in many interdisciplinary fields of research
6252550 cacchio ma certo che cos come avevo fatto a non vederla prima
6252551 im honored that i received this award it is indeed a privilege to stay and live in a city like cupertino which encourages and supports different cultures and countries to come forth and share their cultures
6252552 my goal was to demystify indian cuisine and show that its simple to make
6252553 many indian dishes call for unique spices that require a lot of getting used to
6252554 its not just the delicious food and hema that won this award but the level of perfection involved in it
6252555 i just dont think it will go that far i think orbit and the lender will work out their differences in time
6252556 someone with the authority to stop it says it has to stop
6252557 on hold until the receivership situation changes and the lawsuit with the lender is resolved
6252558 dont worry well be home soon be a good boy
6252559 buyers and sellers are waiting for greater certainty on interest rates before they move sellers are holding back and waiting for conditions to become more favourable and this is limiting opportunities for buyers
6252560 the state government is raising the stamp duty exemption limit for first home buyers from 350 000 to 500 000 from 1 september which will increase capacity for some purchasers in this sub 500 000 market investors are largely competing with first home buyers so the stamp duty reprieve and resulting increase in activity may produce a price spike any capacity advantage is therefore likely to be short lived and only last eight to 12 weeks since many first home buyers are holding out for the stamp duty cuts and remaining in the rental market we are also seeing ongoing upward pressure on rents
6252561 some agents have reported they have about 30 more stock and 30 fewer buyers than they had 12 months ago
6252562 even though auctions are a relatively new phenomenon here properties that were passed in were selling relatively quickly thereafter but theres now a decline in that activity as well
6252563 i expect that those who have been sitting on the sidelines for the past six months will jump in again so some of that banked up supply should be absorbed in the coming months i believe were heading towards a more balanced market with a return to long term averages
6252564 vendors in that sector are questioning why they would sell in a buyers market with many deciding to ride it out whereas in the lower socio economic west suburban belt stock is much more readily available due to increasing numbers of investors selling up in the area
6252565 once rumours of interest rates cuts started circulating auction clearance rates jumped from about 42 to 53 peaking at 63 in the past month or so i believe well have a good steady spring and if we get two interest rate cuts which i think we might that will really return some confidence to the sydney market and well see it start to move again
6252566 the fact that increasing numbers of agents were pushing prospective buyers to submit pre auction offers particularly in the week leading up to the event is both indicative and symptomatic of slower conditions however as more buyers are emerging there has been a dramatic decline in pre auction negotiations
6252567 i dont think you can ever accurately time the bottom of the market but if i had to call it id say were pretty much there now
6252568 welcome to chilo a planet with corrosive rain crushing pressure and deadly heat fortunately fourteen year old timas lives in one of the domed cities that float 100 000 feet above the surface circling near the edge of a monstrous perpetual storm above the acidic clouds the temperature and pressure are normal but to make a living timas like many other young men is lowered to the surface in an armored suit to scavenge what he can timass life is turned upside down when a strange man crash lands on the city the newcomer is fleeing an alien intelligence intent on invading the planet and discovering the secret hidden deep inside the perpetual storm a secret that could lead to interplanetary war
6252569 he didnt exercise sufficient care in his work with the office to avoid getting in a mess like that
6252570 it is my hope that reading these stories inspires some to plant their own seeds of change that when we see something wrong well do something about it whether that means writing to your representative in congress or researching a cure for a disease or simply speaking out against inequality and prejudice were all in this together and the first step toward change can begin with any one of us
6252571 our customers are always looking for effective ways to grow their businesses
6252572 constant contacts customer communication tools give our clients a valuable addition to our core services constant contacts ease of use and affordability made the partner program a great solution to meet our small business clients marketing needs

6252575 i am pleased that big brothers big sisters amachi missouri will be the official charity of the second tour of missouri professional cycling race
6252576 this program is changing lives and bettering the future of young people across our state it is my hope that this partnership will be beneficial for a number of missouri children
6252577 we are excited that our organization has been chosen as the beneficiary of this years tour of missouri said becky james hatter president ceo of big brothers big sisters of eastern missourt
6252578 lieutenant governor peter kinders committment to big brothers big sisters amachi missouri has allowed the program to be a great success for the children we serve
6252579 it is gratifying to know that beginning with the tours opening gala in kansas city on september 6 to the finish in st louis on september 14 proceeds from a number of activities will benefit local children
6252580 85 for the assignment and i recently found that document
6252581 my great grandfather joseph andrew mueller came to america in about 1900 though his name was mueller he used zawodny because it was his stepfathers name
6252582 about 1900 the precise date was april 6 1902 he arrived at the port of new york on the
6252583 he was born in berlin germany on march 8 1882 which is the same day i was born 85 years later
6252584 joseph was an infantryman in the german army and he was serving as a guard in a prison one day he was caught giving cigarettes to the prisoners and he was sentenced to a court marshall since he had to leave he deserted the army and boarded a ship as a stowaway
6252585 when he arrived in new york he spoke several languages but not one was english
6252586 within two years he came to philadelphia and got a job as a toolmaker at nicholson file company it was then his wife came over
6252587 joseph zawodny and laura slezinski were married at a young age sometime before he came over
6252588 daughter of a rich slaughterhouse owner she was born in warsaw poland on september 28 1884
6252589 they probably met because she was a nurse and could have been helping the army
6252590 after laura arrived they bought a house on livingston street where they went on to have eight children from oldest to youngest their children were janine helena marya my grandmother william walter stanley charles and dorothy both william and walter died when they were babies
6252591 after joseph got fired for an incident at the file company he got a job at baden housing which was located in cornwells heights with this job he installed most of atlantic citys heating in the hotels
6252592 when the depression came joseph lost some land in merchantville new jersey he also lost money in richmond bank which is one of the big banks that collapsed
6252593 he retired but when world war ii started he went back to work this time for the coast guard
6252594 josephs daughter marya her husband henrick and their daughters joan and anita my aunt and mother moved in to take care of him
6252595 five and a half years later he died on june 6 1944 which also happened to be d day
6252596 never had any issues with water no foundation no water in the basement nothing like that
6252597 its certainly going to depreciate the property because who wants to live in a flood plain and have to be saddled with that insurance premium every year
6252598 theyve never had water in some of these areas theyre talking about theyve never even had a wet basement so the people have a right to be frustrated with this
6252599 the documentation that they came up with showed significant reason to appeal the maps
6252600 we are extremely pleased to learn that the sheraton overland park hotel was again selected as a best of midamerica
6252601 we appreciate that our customers recognize the sheratons amenities and service as a quality product they would recommend to other event planners
6252602 we wanted the win and it didnt happen we were able to blood one or two new players we had a look at some partnerships passed it quite well at times
6252603 we had one or two opportunities and youre looking to take them when they go down to 10 men theyll sit in there and thats when youve got to take your chances we certainly learnt a lot international football is not easy northern ireland came here and made it difficult for us weve still got a lot to work at but the attitude and commitment was there
6252604 it was a very solid performance we set our stall out with the shape to try to get something from the game to look forward to the world cup campaign
6252605 i called you guys and the next day i called back and all of a sudden everybody had all the answers for me
6252606 after 11 years of a labour government most young people are still failing to achieve five good gcses including maths and english if we are going to have a world class education system we must do more to promote educational achievement especially among the most disadvantaged children
6252607 there is a grave danger that academic study is being reserved for the high performers which will widen socio economic divides
6252608 if this were to escalate there is a very real possibility of a reversion to a system akin to the grammar secondary modern divide though arguably in less meritocratic a form
6252609 that a purportedly equalising labour government should be the architect of such a divide would be tragic irony significantly though it is all too apparent that it is the system which has lost interest in the pupils largely because they run the risk of not delivering the right a to c performance through academic gcses
6252610 the achievement gap between children from deprived backgrounds and the more affluent is closing just because a pupil is on free school meals does not mean they are destined to fail at school many schools in the most deprived areas are achieving excellent gcse results
6252611 it is ridiculous to suggest that performance tables are designed to meet government targets for example two years ago we deliberately changed the tables to include achievement in english and maths this brought about a big decline in reported performance but we made this change because it best served the needs of pupils parents and employers
6252612 during the course of their daily lives in places they go on a frequent basis
6252613 from machine waiting times and intimidating environments to high fees and poor customer service consumer dissatisfaction with the current gym offerings is clear
6252614 virgin active will redefine the gym experience in australia with world class facilities a friendly welcoming environment and that great value for money and customer service that people have come to expect from virgin
6252615 with a proven formula that has seen rapid growth and expansion overseas over the last nine years we believe that the australian market is ripe for the new holistic approach to health and fitness that virgin active offers

6252617 this is a wonderful opportunity we get to pass along to the families in our program
6252618 wed like to thank dr busch and teamsmile for supporting big brothers big sisters and for taking care of our communitys children
6252619 well weve established that the vanagon isnt exactly a race car
6252620 ruby dont drive your air cooled vanagon westfalia to town

6252624 what are the three core strategic things you need to do to keep your business growing profitably

6252629 wow a vampire could totally fall in love with her
6252630 instead of one upping try one downing instead of outdoing try underdoing
6252631 simplicity is not the goal we do not wish to give up the power and flexibility of our technologies
6252632 the garage door opener may be simple but it hardly does anything if my cellphone only had one button it certainly would be simple but umm all i could do would be to turn it on or off i wouldnt be able to make a phone call
6252633 everyone wants more capability so therefore they want more features everyone wants ease of use so therefore they want simplicity
6252634 the arrow goes left to right this says nothing about the right to left direction so extra capability does not require more features similarly ease of use does not require simplicity
6252635 the argument is not between adding features and simplicity between adding capability and usability
6252636 the real issue is about design designing things that have the power required for the job while maintaining understandability the feeling of control and the pleasure of accomplishment
6252637 the heroes of this great artistic labor tend to be semimonastic intro verts who like woods beloved henry james and gustave flaubert toil with the doors shut and locked in soundproof splendid isolation attentive to the subtle frictions among nouns and adjectival phrases
6252638 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative
6252639 franks portrait of the conservative movement sacrifices complexity to caricature
6252640 with rare exceptions like john kenneth galbraith conservatives have been the best satirists in thomas frank
6252641 the lovers in the gargoyle have the intimacy of roommates who hook up when they get drunk not a time defying passion their thoughts feelings conversations and affections are so unformed so hampered by sentiment and under powered awkwardness that the courage endurance and under standing ascribed to them seem silly davidsons lovers are dysfunctional and quirky qualities that can look a bit like profundity from a distance but they dont have emotional or imaginative depth or range which at the end of the day are the only things that can make a love story deep and wide ranging
6252642 west has made 15 reporting trips to iraq over the last six years and is almost as personally invested in the current conflict as he was in vietnam this book his third on iraq is his attempt to ensure that the endgame in iraq turns out better than in his last war
6252643 sharp as he can be in his judgments he is equally sharp in identifying the virtues of what he doesnt like he gives a spacious view of the countryside whatever the particular road he hews through it he takes his subjects seriously but not himself like snow white you might say
6252644 i read the suicide index with a rapacity bordering on need with tears in my chest and in my eyes occasionally i had to put it down and leave the room more often i devoured it the book is the product of a loving daughters grief and part of her process of grieving but it is also the measured elegant gripping work of a professional writer who has set her powers of observation to work on her own family her parents and grandparents her uncle her sister her husband her son and on herself
6252645 the storys emotional intensity is relentless and all of it light or dark is rendered at the same fever pitch the most consuming love until tomorrow when itll get even better the most consuming pain until tomorrow when itll get even worse bella whose human self is bumbling always blushing and a terrible driver becomes the strongest most beautiful most confident vampire ever jacob who begins the tale impatient and cranky also ends up in a new exalted state it might be unreasonable to expect a young adult vampire romance novel to be anything other than hyper intense but what it left me with was this thought readers are permitted to be breathless but stories arent
6252646 it is a bold historian who writes a history of the caucasus as events of the past week have made all too clear

6252649 the commissioner or a deputy commissioner may sue in his or her official name to recover an amount of a tax related liability that remains unpaid after it has become due and payable
6252650 with the valuation taken by the plaintiff of its trading stock land
6252651 concluded that the plaintiff had been in breach of the relevant legislation and imposed penalty tax in addition to billing additional gst
6252652 there is some other reason why the demand should be set aside
6252653 however as we are dealing with gst and with a liability that dehors not within the scope of an assessment the chances of the debt being successfully challenged at law is not in the class of being feeble or non existent
6252654 it follows that either under s459h or s459j of the corporations act the statutory demand must be set aside
6252655 ive spent a large part of my career at united the last nine years and ill remember that time fondly but feel im ready for a new challenge
6252656 arsenal are known for playing technical and skilful football and have a young but experienced squad im really excited about this next stage of my career hopefully playing my part in helping the club to new successes
6252657 we have a strong squad but a young squad and mika ls versatility experience and calibre will provide the extra depth we need to reinforce our challenge for honours this season his defensive adaptability will serve us well and its a big plus that mika l has top level experience and a great understanding of football in the premier league

6252666 a champion of the democratisation of the sadc region in particular and the african continent in general as such his passing on is a sad day to the zimbabwean people who at this stage are yearning for a new beginning which can unquestionably be characterised as democratic and a reflection of the will of the people
6252667 the region has truly lost one of the most influential figures contributing to resolving the zimbabwe situation it now leaves botswana alone
6252668 a serious blot on the culture of democracy in our sub region
6252669 the region has truly lost one of the most influential figures contributing to resolving the zimbabwe situation it now leaves botswana alone
6252670 his mwanawasas leadership was slowly beginning to take away that conservative and freedom fighter mentality which has been undermining governance and democracy in the region the onus now is on the other regional leaders to consolidate on that
6252671 there will be a lot of infighting for the presidency as the mmd has no party vice president who should have been an automatic replacement for president mwanawasa they may have to go to the national convention but time is not allowing them i think we shall soon see the formation of a break away party from mmd before the elections
6252672 president mwanawasas death leaves a big hole in terms of the fight against corruption and seriousness in managing public affairs
6252673 he showed seriousness and his legacy will be remembered as one of the rule of law

6252691 part of a loose but growing network mostly mobilized on the internet erehwon is participating in what is known as community supported agriculture about 150 people have bought shares in erehwon in essence hiring personal farmers and turning the old notion of sharecropping on its head
6252692 i think people are becoming more local minded and this fits right into that
6252693 people are seeing ways to come together and work together to make this successful
6252694 so i decided to go out and help we harvest water pull weeds whatever they need doing
6252695 at the cattleana ranch in omro wisconsin thomas and susan wrchota offer grass fed meat and organic produce through a community supported arrangement they have 55 members and a seven month meat membership costs 715

6252697 our goal is to provide a full portfolio of products for folks who want sustainable products up until about five years ago we had to do a tremendous amount of guerrilla marketing the consumer who is interested now theyre doing their homework they know the health and taste benefits
6252698 from a going green standpoint its an appropriate thing to do
6252699 like everything organic its not a bargain but what price do you put on being healthy considering all things its actually a very good deal
6252700 we eat with the seasons and theres no guarantee that mother nature will cooperate

6252709 their ability to provide a nationwide platform for audiences to enjoy ballet shoes on the big screen has played a key role in creating awareness for this property prior to its release on dvd

6252712 what we found is conservation is less expensive and provides the same kind of capacity that building a plant would so its a smart choice
6252713 what im really struck by is the oomph of that plan

6252721 we made an offer for santa cruz last week and we were told to forget it in the bluntest possible terms weve been told to give up on him mark is adamant that we dont but its fair to say the window is closing and that blackburn have closed it on us
6252722 i think thats so given that we have already taken their manager off them cook said
6252723 i have said jokingly to mark you have only yourself to blame
6252724 at this moment thaksins legal team is proceeding to ask for political asylum for thaksin and his family in britain watchara seangprathum one of the former prime ministers thai lawyers said

6252727 ive always hated when lingerie is uncomfortable so the fit and comfort was key
6252728 people have come to me with other ideas but lingerie is a passion for me and just like music and acting i cant do it unless i put 100 into it
6252729 we have one of the finest midfielders in steven gerrard he plays for liverpool and he is like roy of the rovers he shoots he scores he tackles he is not a left midfielder it is unbelievable he has to be in the centre
6252730 that was one of the worst performances i have seen from an england team what positives can you take from that the second half was diabolical they didnt look like the same players who perform week in week out in the premier league what are we doing to them
6252731 we keep chopping and changing managers and we dont improve ive not seen fabio capello teams play worse than that the players did not perform
6252732 we played 4 3 2 1 we played defoe gerrard and rooney and three midfielders behind them the position he had to play between the line of the full backs and the midfielders
6252733 he has to express something mr redknapp because he didnt play on the left the movement he went to the left and to the middle he never played on the left
6252734 im happy i saw a lot of things which i had doubts on i think well be ready for the next games
6252735 im happy for the draw because the reaction to the team to the last minute was good i think also that the first half we played with good football good style and created a lot of chances
6252736 only one thing i dont like in the first half sometimes when the czechs had counter attacks we suffered
6252737 that was the problem we have to prepare something to combat that problem the second half they scored immediately we lost the style and we lost the position
6252738 im a winger but the manager wanted me to play off the front man
6252739 new manager and new ideas weve got to try things
6252740 but at this point we have no single core versions of nehalem on our roadmap
6252741 and in the future well see well above two bins of performance delta
6252742 the amount of thermal headroom that can be provided in a two core environment to the other core is very small because you still have the leakage power thats being consumed and you only have the power of one core being available for the second core
6252743 the fuselage is destroyed the plane burned i have seen a kilometer of charred land and few whole pieces of the fuselage it is all destruction

6252752 we have continued to invest sensibly and appropriately into future proofing auckland airport over the last four years we have invested nearly 500 million in significantly upgrading and expanding all of the key facilities at auckland airport we are now well on the road to delivering on our vision of becoming new zealands airport
6252753 although growth in domestic passenger volumes has been pleasing we expect that international passenger growth will remain below the long term average over the next 12 months
6252754 short term macro economic conditions in new zealand and internationally
6252755 we are beginning to see signs of new international seat capacity coming into the auckland market and we expect there will be more to come in the 2009 year competition in the domestic market continues and we are seeing real benefits from our investment in the domestic terminal precinct
6252756 i thought i was ocs over the line at the start so when i arrived at the top mark i checked the board to see if i was over i just turned my head to look and lost my balance
6252757 nick shouted a little bit and made it look closer than it was but it wasnt an issue he had a bit of nerves and made a bigger deal of it than it should have been and i figured that stage he was broken and struggling a little bit
6252758 i saw nick afterwards and just felt really sorry for him its pretty tough when something like that comes down one race
6252759 hes a friend ive known him for a long time and hes a very good sailor with lots of experience hes had an amazing year
6252760 i wont say ive lived like a monk for the last little while but ive been really focused and i need to take some time off and think about life
6252761 i was a little bit emotional but not as much as i expected ive been on verge of tears for the last 24 hours but the relief of winning killed a bit of that all through last night and this morning i was pretty nervous it was a pretty stressful day and a stressful race
6252762 get that baby to call me right now i want to talk to him
6252763 barack obama is no different only its your money he wants to spend
6252764 positive bio spots that theyve been running the balance of the summer dont appear to be making any significant connection with undecided voters
6252765 when the senate investigated the senator in charge never even called reed to testify and that senator john mccain

6252770 i believe that to make wiki adoption successful and fully realize its benefits
6252771 they really need a good plan for managed growth that takes into account their size history of enterprise software use or misuse ensures people get the most out of their wiki use and helps minimize performance and efficiency issues related to too rapid growth so im launching this
6252772 our environment has a defining influence on the performance of our business and we were clearly not immune to these market forces in 2008
6252773 as fellow shareholders we are disappointed this years results have not been consistent with previous results which delivered total returns for our shareholders in excess of 30 per cent per annum in the decade up to 2007
6252774 a continuation of the current market conditions would again impact our revenues and profitability in 2009
6252775 hes been a valuable employee with us for quite a long time
6252776 he was the first person who became infected in this outbreak
6252777 it is just devastating for the last five weeks i guess his family has virtually had to make a daily vigil with him against overwhelming odds
6252778 barack obamas ad is ridiculous because of john mccain corruption was exposed and people like jack abramoff went to jail
6252779 however if barack obama wants to have a discussion about truly questionable associations lets start with his relationship with the unrepentant terrorist william ayers at whose home obamas political career was reportedly launched
6252780 the question now is will barack obama immediately call on the university of illinois to release all of the records they are currently withholding to shed further light on senator obamas relationship with this unrepentant terrorist
6252781 la liga is widely regarded as one of the most exciting leagues in the world and we re delighted to have been able to secure this deal

6252788 the goal of the dita maturity model community is to elevate the discussion off the page
6252789 now practitioners managers and executives have access to a working forum where they can share knowledge and practical guidance develop business cases test out implementation scenarios and get peer to peer advice
6252790 which makes me optimistic about the medium to longer term growth outlook
6252791 however brambles recognises that the more difficult consumer environment in many markets has the potential to dampen organic growth in the short term
6252792 the substantial growth we found in indoor tanning facilities and services is likely to still underestimate the true size of the industry some services are offered without being advertised in the yellow pages such as those at some hotels and motels
6252793 sunbeds can emit ultraviolet radiation as much as 36 times stronger than the summer midday sun recent research has indicated potential serious health risks from their use especially for those less than 35 years of age and women there has also been evidence of irresponsibility among some new zealand industry providers
6252794 now is an ideal time for new zealand authorities to collaborate with those drafting the australian legislation

6252805 were excited to support the 2008 christmas traveleague luncheon and continue our close working relationship with the travel and tourism industry
6252806 the issues are similar to the defence force just because you dont have a war doesnt mean you disband the army navy and air force
6252807 our darwin office closed six months ago and now we are losing all the rest it is difficult to see how we can possibly service remote areas such as queensland and the northern territory with the remaining staff
6252808 there used to be 10 technical staff in brisbane to look after southeast queensland now we have four and we have to cover all the areas handled by the closed offices
6252809 on top of that acma receives more than 8 million from the government to do digital television field strength measurements all over australia prior to the analogue switch off in 2013
6252810 this is to establish just what the problems are going to be and believe me there are some real problems
6252811 so far we have done about 1200 but they may have to be done again because there has been a rethink and there may have been a blunder in getting us to do the measurement at 2 5m antenna height instead of a more realistic height as found at most homes
6252812 unless this work is completed in time for translators and fill in transmitters to be installed there is a real risk that many thousands of people will be watching blank screens when analogue switches off
6252813 we have another team using new equipment replicating the tests done at 2 5m and the results they have been getting from their tests at a height of 10m show substantially the same results as the earlier readings
6252814 these cuts highlight the damage short sighted arbitrary efficiency dividend cuts can have
6252815 there are always unintended consequences and it appears in this instance that they may be very costly we are urging acma and the government to revisit this issue

6252960 the land was purchased with the idea of future development
6252961 i am writing to follow up on recent serious allegations regarding the creation of a false letter from tahir jalil habbush saddam husseins former chief of intelligence to saddam hussein
6252962 the letter which was allegedly backdated to july 1 2001 attempted to establish an operational link between al qaeda and saddam hussein in the period before the 9 11 attacks by specifically stating that 9 11 ringleader mohammed atta had received training in iraq
6252963 upon careful review of the allegations concerning this matter i have become very concerned with the possibility that this administration may have violated federal law by using the resources of our intelligence agencies to influence domestic policy processes or opinion
6252964 n o covert action may be conducted which is intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media
6252965 it is not the sort of offense such as assault or burglary that carries specific penalties for example a fine or jail time
6252966 it is much broader than that it pertains to the white houses knowingly misusing an arm of government the sort of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings
6252967 i asked chairman conyers to investigate these claims because if true the administration fabricated evidence and used it to lead the country into an unprovoked war
6252968 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
6252969 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
6252970 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
6252971 probably passed through five or six people george tenet probably showed it to me but then passed it probably to jim pavitt the cias deputy director of operations who then passed it down to his chief of staff who passed it to me cause thats how you know so i saw the original i got a copy of it
6252972 far from being comfortable i told mr suskind that many of the things he wrote about what i did and said were wrong
6252973 statement and my absolute belief that the charges outlined in mr suskinds book regarding agency involvement in forging documents are not true
6252974 during my time as a senior officer i saw many documents from various offices of the white house regarding many topics
6252975 they were in fact on white paper i was asked to respond to documents regarding the potential use of habbush upon his defection and during the difficult fall of 2003 when we were wrestling with a developing iraqi insurgency and ways to combat it i was also involved in many queries from elements of the administration trying to document an and saddam government link proof of which was never found many of such queries did originate from the staff of the office of the vice president none of this however substantiates mr suskinds explosive allegation
6252976 it is important to note however in the transcript just released i make no mention of having received an order to fabricate the letter as claimed by mr
6252977 the suskind account states that two senior cia officers robert richer and john maguire supervised the preparation of the document under direct orders coming from director george tenet
6252978 tenet is for once telling the truth when he states that he would not have undermined himself by preparing such a document while at the same time insisting publicly that there was no connection between saddam and al qaeda richer and maguire have both denied that they were involved with the forgery and it should also be noted that preparation of such a document to mislead the media is illegal and they could have wound up in jail
6252979 who was behind the forgery hated and mistrusted the agency and would not have used it for such a sensitive assignment
6252980 the pentagon has its own false documents center primarily used to produce fake papers for delta force and other special ops officers traveling under cover as businessmen
6252981 it was feiths office that produced the letter and then surfaced it to the media in iraq unlike the agency the pentagon had no restrictions on it regarding the production of false information to mislead the public indeed one might argue that doug feiths office specialized in such activity
6252982 was inappropriately performing intelligence activities of developing producing and disseminating that should be performed by the intelligence community

6252985 while we continue to see volatility in international markets and increases in the average cost of long term funding we have experienced some short term funding relief which we are keen to pass on to our customers he said
6252986 while i am pleased to make todays undertaking our medium and long term funding and our retail deposit base represent the greatest proportion of our funding costs and the average cost of these sources of funding continue to increase
6252987 the recent fall in short term funding costs provides an opportunity to undertake to move rates in line with the rba decision but future interest rate decisions will need to reflect an assessment of all the cost of funding factors
6252988 all australian banks are reliant on offshore funding and increases in the average cost of long term funding are likely to be with us for some time
6252989 therefore any consideration that the federal government can give to enhance the attractiveness of retail bank deposits will help reduce overall funding costs and assist in lowering mortgages rates
6252990 clearly we would love to pass through the full 25 basis points drop if that were to occur but well need to factor in all of those issues at that time she told an investor briefing made similar comments the same day
6252991 cms goal for updating and enhancing the hospital compare web site is to provide usable and accurate information about hospital performance to providers and communities that will encourage hospitals to excel in the quality of care they provide
6252992 with these new enhancements consumers and health care providers will be able to look at individual hospital mortality scores we hope that this new information will cement the web sites role as a key driver in improving the quality and reliability of care in the nations hospitals
6252993 people in the general public look at mortality or survival rate as being a very key indicator
6252994 and pneumonia heart attack and heart failure are three areas in which we have national agreement in how to define measure and report outcomes
6252995 its great to know how you are doing you need to know how youre doing so you can do better
6252996 in the short run it will allow the hospital to look more carefully at their own data and improve things but for individual patients who want to choose their own care it can be more misleading than helpful
6252997 it is a good way to get the process going but it is not enough and not the right type of information
6252998 we are still in the early stages of this process
6252999 it is a bit hard to digest for the average consumer
6253000 we have been working with cms for five or six years to come up with measures that people could trust
6253001 but one thing that is true is that no one sees this measure as a means to select hospital when critically ill
6253002 we think that putting this information out and clearly communicating it to hospitals and their boards means that people have to look at their performance it is a tool to understand how you are doing
6253003 i do hope that it empowers groups of patients and community groups and hospital boards to engage in a conversation with their institution they really need to be held accountable

6253021 workforce development has everything to do with recruiting and retaining workers and retraining workers
6253022 there has been lots of work that has happened here and that is the goal of today to hear about the progress that has been made
6253023 we thought it was appropriate to bring greg up so that he could help us understand what the state was doing and we could dovetail some of our efforts with those of the state
6253024 what do we have to do to make sure we retain the workers we do have and then second what can the community do to recruit workers to minot
6253025 people who have left nd and would like to return to be with families that is a great opportunity for us

6253034 my parents generation believed it was their responsibility to pay most of a childs college expenses if they had to give up trips and toys in order to save the necessary money they did thrift was a virtue the notion that everyone regardless of income should live for the day and indulge every consumerist whim would have been regarded with contempt apparently values have changed
6253035 you have x amount and the extra is yours to keep
6253036 i would rather pay for undergrad at a decent state school and help fund a graduate degree than pay for a mediocre private school
6253037 we are talking about 17 and 18 year olds we dont let them drink or rent cars but we think they can be solely responsible for planning their financial and carer futures they need good parental guidance while making these decisions

6253046 to understand changes in the political map we naturally tend to look for contemporary explanations but american political alignments are not written on an empty slate beginnings matter and the civic personalities of states tend to reflect the cultural folkways of their first settlers
6253047 one is the route of the westward surge of new england yankees across upstate new york northern ohio southern michigan and into northern illinois mccain is running ahead of bush in massachusetts and just one point behind in new york and despite its economic problems michigan
6253048 this yankee settled region has been turned off by southern accents such as bushs texas twang and mccain evidently is less off putting to its cultural liberals
6253049 the other area in which mccain is running even with or better than bush is the set of states settled by the who thronged to the appalachians in colonial days and whose descendants followed the southwest path pioneered by their

6253051 an entire industry much of it unregulated has grown up around kidnapping with consultants to negotiate the ransom insurance policies to cover any ransom losses and an array of safety measures available to those who can pay from given the involvement of some wayward officers in the kidnapping trade it is easy to see why victims relatives look outside police forces in trying to bring such nightmares to an end
6253052 a business leader who survived a kidnapping and asked not to be named told israelis as bodyguards somebody else was mentioning using american special forces as they are being demobilized and are more serious do we have to have our own paramilitary forces we have to be organized as the government obviously is not i am sending my family to the u s his sentiments are common in gatherings of the wealthy where options under discussion range from emigration to buying a smaller house and less ostentatious car and of course investing more heavily in private security

6253064 beberapa waktu lalu kami sempat mengejar dua orang gadis asal kota mataram yang dieksploitasi sebagai pekerja seks komersial psk di pulau sumbawa ternyata kasus perdagangan anak dengan pola seperti itu sudah berlangsung sejak lama
6253065 kami pun sudah berkoordinasi dengan aparat berwajib agar masalah ini ditangani sesuai ketentuan hukum yang berlaku memang membutuhkan keterpaduan pihak pihak terkait untuk menangani persoalan sosial itu
6253066 padahal departemen keuangan sudah memiliki peraturan menteri keuangan nomor 996 pmk 2006 tentang kewajiban bagi pegawai depkeu untuk menyampaikan laporan harta dan kekayaan pejabat negara lhkpn tetapi tetap saja ada yang tidak melapor atas dasar itu seharusnya mereka sudah harus melaporkan kepada kami sejak 2006
6253067 atas dasar itu pemeriksa pajak tergolong pejabat negara yang strategis sehingga sudah seharusnya mereka melaporkan harta dan kekayaannya apalagi ditjen pajak merupakan suatu lembaga yang sangat besar
6253068 adanya pemeriksa pajak yang tidak menyampaikan laporan harta kekayaannya karena selama ini tidak ada yang menegur oleh karena itu saya menegur mereka dan memberi batas waktu sebulan untuk melaporkan kekayaannya
6253069 i followed the managers and coaches advice and then hit the home run
6253070 we know we can play better and be more of a unit so we will start that hopefully against andorra and then croatia
6253071 i asked to play against the czechs for this reason to know where the problems are i see that when we play against a team that waits for us and counterattacks it is not easy to score
6253072 hes a great player and i hope he helps me a lot in the transition to the nba
6253073 for me that would be perfect filling calderons old role
6253074 ill be a rookie and ill take some time to adapt to the new game and a new team for the first time last year i had a pretty good season and the raptors for the first time they particularly wanted me it wasnt just talk it was really action
6253075 so i decided it was good for me because i had an opportunity to play and not just be part of the team im 23 years old i dont have time to wait any more
6253076 we need ukic to play this year and i think thats what made it enticing for him to come
6253077 you look back at joses first year and it wasnt anything really exciting but he learned the league and thats the most important for ukic learn the nba
6253078 the fact that no one in the government would actually vote to keep jon stanhope in the chamber reflects that perhaps even his colleagues were a bit concerned by his behaviour

6253095 i guess if i told you jeff hickman senior producer for war would karate kick that door come in here and then you would have an interview where youd have to explain what it was like seeing his boots which have leather flames being pressed on my throat were not talking about the expansion other than we have relentless meetings about it itll be awesome obviously

6253126 cms goal for updating and enhancing the hospital compare web site is to provide usable and accurate information about hospital performance to providers and communities that will encourage hospitals to excel in the quality of care they provide
6253127 with these new enhancements consumers and health care providers will be able to look at individual hospital mortality scores we hope that this new information will cement the web sites role as a key driver in improving the quality and reliability of care in the nations hospitals
6253128 people in the general public look at mortality or survival rate as being a very key indicator
6253129 and pneumonia heart attack and heart failure are three areas in which we have national agreement in how to define measure and report outcomes
6253130 its great to know how you are doing you need to know how youre doing so you can do better
6253131 in the short run it will allow the hospital to look more carefully at their own data and improve things but for individual patients who want to choose their own care it can be more misleading than helpful
6253132 it is a good way to get the process going but it is not enough and not the right type of information
6253133 we are still in the early stages of this process
6253134 it is a bit hard to digest for the average consumer
6253135 we have been working with cms for five or six years to come up with measures that people could trust
6253136 but one thing that is true is that no one sees this measure as a means to select hospital when critically ill
6253137 we think that putting this information out and clearly communicating it to hospitals and their boards means that people have to look at their performance it is a tool to understand how you are doing
6253138 i do hope that it empowers groups of patients and community groups and hospital boards to engage in a conversation with their institution they really need to be held accountable
6253139 we havent ran anywhere in two days i think that is a record

6253149 may i see that i never have seen one quite so beautiful
6253150 i haven t always been a teacup there was a time when i was red and i was clay my master took me and rolled me and patted me over and over and i yelled out let me alone but he only smiled not yet
6253151 and suddenly i was spun around and around and around and around stop it i m getting dizzy i screamed but the master only nodded and said not yet
6253152 then he put me in the oven i d never felt such heat i wondered why he wanted to burn me i yelled i knocked at the door i could see him through the opening and i could read his lips as he shook his head not yet
6253153 finally the door opened he put me on the shelf and i began to cool there that s better i said then he brushed me and painted me all over the fumes were horrible i thought i would gag stop it stop it i cried he only nodded not yet
6253154 then suddenly he put me back into the oven not like the first one
6253155 then i knew there wasn t any hope i would never make it i was ready to give up but the door opened and he took me out and placed me on the shelf
6253156 i want you to remember then he said i know it hurt to be rolled and patted but if i just left you you d have dried up
6253157 i know it made you dizzy to spin around on the wheel but if i had stopped you would have crumbled
6253158 i know it hurt and it was hot and disagreeable in the oven but if i hadn t put you there you would have cracked
6253159 i know the fumes were bad and when i brushed and painted you all over but if i hadn t done that you never would have hardened you would not have had any color in your life and if i hadn t put you back in that second oven you wouldn t survive for very long because the hardness would not have held

6253174 im going to the republican convention not to attack the democratic candidate but to explain to the american people why i support john mccain senator mccain asked me to do it and i strongly support him
6253175 what he refused to do on behalf of the democratic ticket
6253176 now willing to do on behalf of the republican party
6253177 hes going to iraq but hes already decided his position hes not going to listen to general david petraeus hes not going to listen to our troops i think thats not the kind of leadership we need in the oval office
6253178 senator lieberman has always been there for senator reid even on close votes except for iraq

6253180 for almost a decade we have heard experts saying bangladesh will be under water but so far our data has shown nothing like this
6253181 natural accretion has been going on here for hundreds of years along the estuaries and all our models show it will go on for decades or centuries into the future
6253182 in new york we dont think of alternative power as something that we just import from other parts of the nation
6253183 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
6253184 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
6253185 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
6253186 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
6253187 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
6253188 he was going through each name talking about pluses and minuses
6253189 i just told him the bottom line he knows it pick a person you can work with who can help lead this country
6253190 i wont hand over my energy policy to my vice president without knowing necessarily what hes doing
6253191 cutlers got to be a little more consistent before we anoint him
6253192 i think it helps but it doesnt guarantee hes going to win the state
6253193 it may be more useful that evan bayh is on the ticket in other parts of the country he may be more useful in an area like florida
6253194 youre picking somebody from next door youre picking somebody from the midwest who presumably has different values than you
6253195 if evan bayh does become vice president of the united states it leaves an opening at junior senator from indiana its an opening that according to state law the governor gets the opportunity to fill
6253196 to argue that putting bayh on the ticket automatically gives obama indiana is incorrect
6253197 i think it makes it more competitive i still think mccain would have a good chance of winning
6253198 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6253199 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6253200 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6253201 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6253202 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6253203 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6253204 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
6253205 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
6253206 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6253207 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6253208 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6253209 americans across our country are hurting because of the cost of energy
6253210 its time for america to get serious about energy independence and that means we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this
6253211 everyone says america is the land of opportunity for renewables
6253212 people in the neighbourhood are being approached to establish when the car was parked there
6253213 clearly the car has been driven from riccarton rd where ms downey was last seen
6253214 this is where we have found success and we are the clear leader
6253215 we came here to win and we are leaving winners
6253216 much more needs to be done to create the access necessary for the oil industry to do what it does best and develop this countrys resources to secure our energy security
6253217 i would guess that these leases are pretty well picked over
6253218 you have a richer opportunity in a place that has not been previously developed
6253219 to go through what i went through and be back on top again im just so blessed right now
6253220 i came to the birds nest to lay a golden egg and thats what i did
6253221 i am surprised we havent won more gold but you know what i hope this sets a trend
6253222 any mistakes i made i put the blame on me
6253223 it was up to me to do something to change things
6253224 theres so much emotion going through my head and so much excitement i kind of just want to see my mom
6253225 the beijing olympics has witnessed the greatest olympian of all time michael phelps of the usa
6253226 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
6253227 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit
6253228 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference
6253229 it cant be described well never ever see it again
6253230 hes a nice guy a good bloke and the last few years ive never seen him change
6253231 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6253232 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6253233 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6253234 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6253235 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6253236 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6253237 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6253238 the hardest thing for a first time candidate to do unless hes already particularly well known in the community for something hes done is to build name id
6253239 dont have to go through the months and months and months of introducing themselves to voters
6253240 an important thing to realize i think is that youre not starting necessarily from where you finished last cycle
6253241 the mistake a candidate can make who got very close last cycle is to assume they start at that point and all they need to do is make up for the 1 000 votes or the 3 000 votes or whatever it is theyre short
6253242 it might be easier to start off with a blank slate than to start off with a guy whos got very high negatives
6253243 theres nothing that will teach you to deal with the media better than dealing with the media you learn that its a bleeping hot stove and it will burn you if you put your hand on it
6253244 the issue matrix is so different this time around and i believe it certainly plays to my strength
6253245 last time kagen ran against the establishment and now he is the establishment
6253246 its kind of like a team that made it to the super bowl and loses but they have that experience of going very far and the next time theyre going to win it
6253247 it was an absolutely fabulous night for our statewide candidates
6253248 they all outperformed what our expectations could have been dino first and foremost
6253249 a lot of my friends talk to me about these issues but not a lot of people do something about it
6253250 i think its really important for young people to get involved
6253251 thats the key here you have to have a comprehensive plan that looks at everything so we become less dependent on foreign oil
6253252 we get nothing out of the plan to drill offshore
6253253 seven hundred thirty of his constituents have signed a petition that we need to get away from using oil we gotta do something better than the same old stuff
6253254 cheap clean renewable energy sources like solar and wind within 10 years
6253255 its important to me because the state of economy as well as national security hinge on these very issues
6253256 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
6253257 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
6253258 cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
6253259 senator mccain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge
6253260 in iraq gains have been made in lowering the level of violence thanks to the outstanding efforts of our military the increasing capability of iraqs security forces the cease fire of shiite militias and the decision taken by sunni tribes to take the fight to al qaeda
6253261 understand what the essential argument was about before the surge i argued that the long term solution in iraq is political the iraqi government must reconcile its differences and take responsibility for its future that holds true today
6253262 he is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
6253263 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure and he declared that behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has many times before that i put personal ambition before my country
6253264 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
6253265 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
6253266 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
6253267 instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
6253268 the movie revolves around a singular day when jimmy page the edge and jack white first met and sat down together to share their stories teach and play
6253269 captures the guitarists as each explains and demonstrates how he changed the sound of the electric guitar to suit his own distinctive musical style
6253270 hey this makes sense its charles krauthammer and hes talking on this subject this will convince you
6253271 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
6253272 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
6253273 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
6253274 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
6253275 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
6253276 the roman catholic church which was supposed to carry the light of the gospel plunged the world into the dark ages
6253277 john paul ii will be remembered for staring down communism and embracing people of all faiths and colors
6253278 it honors the hard work of so many people who supported sen clinton
6253279 many of the pennsylvania delegates worked their heart out for sen clinton and theyre excited to cast a vote for her from my vantage point that will be closure for them
6253280 the government has taken tremendous liberties with our liberty taking away our liberty in the name of fighting terrorism using fear to take away peoples rights and their privacy in this country
6253281 and thats caused me and a lot of americans to lose a great deal of faith in the government which ought to be protecting our liberties not taking them away
6253282 they simply dont want the competition from an outsider so to speak somebody that might make them feel uncomfortable by raising some issues some new perspectives some new choices for the american people
6253283 youll get to see hillary speak on tuesday and barack obama the next president of the united states on thursday
6253284 and i hear hillary and you will have a chat ill make sure to stop by
6253285 after the crimes they know they have committed and that many of us know they have committed because we have seen the evidence some of which has even appeared on the corporate whore news media of late
6253286 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
6253287 if only this picture had been published before the 2000 election gore would be president
6253288 trying to make excuses or to yell about my articles
6253289 americans end up getting bad information and supporting bad decisions and strategies
6253290 i think when you get so distant from the facts as as guys like limbaugh and sean hannity do yeah i think that tends to corrupt the dialogue
6253291 defend and explain one example where i said something that was so false
6253292 youre not listening susan youve got to learn something he saddam had weapons of mass destruction he promised to disclose them and he didnt do it you would have let him go free we decided to hold him accountable
6253293 and kay had also not discovered any chemical or biological weapons
6253294 colin powell just had a great piece that he had in the paper today he was there in iraq he said things couldnt have been better
6253295 iraq has come very far but serious problems remain starting with security american commanders and troops told me of the many threats they face from leftover loyalists who want to return iraq to the dark days of saddam from criminals who were set loose on iraqi society when saddam emptied the jails and increasingly from outside terrorists who have come to iraq to open a new front in their campaign against the civilized world
6253296 and in northern iraq today this very day al qaeda is operating camps there and they are attacking the kurds in the north and this has been well documented and well chronicled now if youre going to go after al qaeda in every aspect and obviously they have the support of saddam or were not
6253297 kay also called a speech where cheney made the claim there was a link to al qaeda
6253298 after 9 11 liberal democrats at first showed little interest in the investigation of the roots of this massive intelligence failure bush and his team made it clear that determining the causes of americas security failures and finding and remedying its weak points would be central to their mission
6253299 president bush took a few minutes during his trip to europe thursday to voice his opposition to establishing a special commission to probe how the government dealt with terror warnings before sept 11
6253300 first of all this president you know and i know and everybody knows inherited a recession it was by every definition a recession
6253301 the recession officially began in 2001 months after bush was sworn in according to the universally acknowledged arbiter of such things the national bureau of economic research and president bush at other times has also said so himself
6253302 the hispanic community got to know him bush in texas they went almost overwhelming for him he more than quadrupled the hispanic vote that he got in that state
6253303 look weve had these reports very disturbing reports and i have actually spoken to people that have confirmed a lot of the reports about the trashing of the white house when the clintons left the white house pornographic materials left in the printers they cut the phone lines lewd and crude messages on phone machines stripping of anything that was not bolted down on air force one 200 000 in furniture taken out
6253304 is it you hate this president or that you hate america
6253305 governor why wouldnt anyone want to say the pledge of allegiance unless they detested their own country or were ignorant of its greatness
6253306 you could explain something about your magazine the nation lisa featherstone writing about the hate america march the anti war march that took place over the weekend
6253307 i hate america this is the extreme left there is a portion of the left not everybody whos left that does hate this country and blame this country for the ills of the world
6253308 you dont like this country do you you think this is an evil country by your description of it right here you think its a bad country
6253309 it doesnt say anywhere in the constitution this idea of the separation of church and state
6253310 congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof
6253311 the senators and representatives before mentioned and the members of the several state legislatures and all executive and judicial officers both of the united states and of the several states shall be bound by oath or affirmation to support this constitution but no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the united states
6253312 you want to refer to some liberal activist judge thats fine but im going to go directly to the source the author of the bill of rights james madison hired the first chaplain in 1789 and i gotta tell ya somethin i think the author of the bill of rights knows more about the original intent no offense to you and your liberal atheist activism knows more about it than you do
6253313 is the appointment of chaplains to the two houses of congress consistent with the constitution and with the pure principle of religious freedom in strictness the answer on both points must be in the negative
6253314 but the alabama constitution which chief justice roy moore is sworn to uphold clearly it says as a matter of fact that the recognition of god is the foundation of that states constitution
6253315 that no religion shall be established by law that no preference shall be given by law to any religious sect society denomination or mode of worship that no one shall be compelled by law to attend any place of worship nor to pay any tithes taxes or other rate for building or repairing any place of worship or for maintaining any minister or ministry that no religious test shall be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under this state and that the civil rights privileges and capacities of any citizen shall not be in any manner affected by his religious principles
6253316 betsy theyre not going to lose it public housing because if you work less than 30 hours a week if you work more than 30 hours a week you dont have to do it if youre between the ages of 18 and 62 and youre not legally disabled and you have free housing in other words
6253317 no wait a second sean let me correct you most people in public housing are not receiving free housing many of them are paying almost market rates
6253318 betsy that is so ridiculous and so false its hardly even worth spending the time
6253319 but he senator kerry wanted to cancel every major weapons system specific votes that he would have canceled the weapons systems we now use
6253320 in 1991 kerry opposed an amendment to impose an arbitrary 2 percent cut in the military budget in 1992 he opposed an amendment to cut pentagon intelligence programs by 1 billion in 1994 he voted against a motion to cut 30 5 billion from the defense budget over the next five years and to redistribute the money to programs for education and the disabled that same year he opposed an amendment to postpone construction of a new aircraft carrier in 1996 he opposed a motion to cut six f 18 jet fighters from the budget in 1999 he voted against a motion to terminate the trident ii missile
6253321 if he kerry had his way and the cia would almost be nonexistent
6253322 i look at the aspects of our ticket where were strongest and where were most in need of help and joe brings more to the ticket than any of the other people whose names are mentioned as finalists
6253323 with all due respect and i know the other folks in consideration theyre a wonderful group but theyre not really all that close
6253324 you guys have better things to do im not the guy
6253325 you cant implificate me this time im up to my floppy ears in afghanistan trying to pacificate those presidentless folks over there
6253326 shoot i concoctified katrina to guarantee me one more term in office i did not have sex with that woman ms nature im still experimentating on a secret mass amnesia event that will allow me to sorta reintroducify myself as the next american messiah that way i can get reelected all over gain for the first time ive codenamed the project operation forget me not no wait operation forget me no wait oh just forget it
6253327 well ah ah i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective
6253328 answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
6253329 this is something that i have not i think come to a firm resolution on i think its very hard to know what that means when life begins is it when a cell separates is it when the soul stirs so i dont presume to know the answer to that question what i know as ive said before is that there is something extraordinarily powerful about potential life and that has a moral weight to it that we take into consideration when were having these debates
6253330 im not sure if there are human beings in there but go ahead and blow it up
6253331 of his race and questions about his patriotism values and faith that republicans have already vigorously sought to raise and exploit
6253332 im asking a lot of the american people and i know that
6253333 my biography is not typical of a modern american president
6253334 he tipped us off he was working on a deal that if you want more information before the news conference to drop in the office
6253335 sure its city land thats been talked about for years but i dont have the same concerns as alan and his blogger friends do
6253336 to me councils role begins when the feasibility study comes in nobody can proceed doing anything on that property without council involvement ropriation so council will have a very active role
6253337 i keep reminding them they will have to look elsewhere for funding if the symphony project is deemed feasible
6253338 this extension related to your request necessitates a search through a large number of records where meeting the original time limit will unreasonably interferewith the operation of the departments conducting the search
6253339 someone has to make a determination whats appropriate thats why its going to the city solicitor
6253340 by bringing in this professional horsepower we will have the third party expertise we need so the report will withstand the scrutiny we expect it will be under by a variety of stakeholders
6253341 we need to make sure the final audit report can withstand scrutiny in the public eye and court of law
6253342 its premature and incomplete not a document thats ready for release
6253343 come puoi stare con una che ti fa stare male allora io non starei mai insieme ad una persona che mi fa stare male
6253344 the warehouse had a high concentration of flammable car parts in it so we had to be cautious
6253345 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
6253346 if obamas able to win in these states it will have more to do with national trends against the republican party manifesting themselves than with political and demographic changes on the ground
6253347 that national shift has to be great enough to upset the historical pattern of these states tending to vote republican for president
6253348 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
6253349 if obamas able to win in these states it will have more to do with national trends against the republican party manifesting themselves than with political and demographic changes on the ground
6253350 that national shift has to be great enough to upset the historical pattern of these states tending to vote republican for president
6253351 in the olympics we recognize that its possible for two competitors to both be perfect 10s a judge who feels that way can give both athletes the top score americans dont have that option in the voting booth even if you like two candidates you can vote for only one this is the root of the spoiler effect whenever two candidates base of support overlaps like al gore and ralph nader in 2000 voters who like both have to choose one and sometimes that prevents the most popular candidate from winning its happened at least five times in u s presidential elections one possible reform is to use a rating system much like that used in the olympics some have criticized scoring systems as complicated but people use them online all the time now rating videos and books on youtube and amazon both computer simulations and some real world trials have made a strong case that rating systems do the best job of reflecting voter sentiment
6253352 no matter when such election reforms are more widely enacted theres no good reason why pollsters shouldnt conduct some polls giving people greater choices right now
6253353 instead of focusing on positive free market solutions to energy challenges speaker of the house nancy pelosi and the democratic majority are pushing for the proven failed tax and regulatory policies of the past
6253354 and they are cheered on by global warming alarmists like al gore who want energy to be much more expensive so americans use less
6253355 educate citizens on the hot air in the energy and global warming debates
6253356 the oil and gas industry has launched a frenzied attack on these balanced common sense protections
6253357 i am here today to urge the cogcc to do what is best for all of colorado and tell an industry that routinely uses and spills dozens of toxic chemicals to stay at least 300 feet away from public drinking water sources
6253358 with tens of thousands of more wells on the way we need strong protections to ensure the oil and gas industry does not jeopardize our health and safety
6253359 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
6253360 there are droughts in north and south carolina parts of california most of new zealand and this idiot who firmly believes he can induce rain by prayer is wasting it by asking his lord and savior to play a political prank its not boyish humor and youre a selfish hypocrite
6253361 the democratic vice presidential prick in 2000 who now is an independent
6253362 following the lead of political families like the strogers and lipinskis illinois senate president emil jones is anointing one of his children to take over for him when he retires in january
6253363 his preference yes would be to see his son serve
6253364 in rural minnesota one district is skipping classes every monday to save fuel nationwide at least 14 other districts are switching to four day weeks and dozens more are considering it

6253368 petite leggy women with big busts are the most sexually attractive study reveals
6253369 protester sheehan and public enemy coming to denver for dnc
6253370 a man being suspended in the air by six metal hooks clamped to his skin during an act at a tattoo convention fell and broke a leg
6253371 trying so hard to be perfect that it is stultifying
6253372 if obama gets elected and there is nothing funny about him it wont be the economy thats depressed it will be the rest of us
6253373 the space is available and nothing is there at the present time
6253374 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 schlemiel schlemazel
6253375 ive looked down the barrel of an m 16 at an enemy of our nation put him in my sights and squeezed the trigger you never have and anyone anyone who thinks ill do any less to our enemies today knows nothing about who i really am
6253376 how do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake
6253377 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
6253378 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
6253379 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians
6253380 arsenals of nuclear chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them
6253381 if we have to use force it is because we are america we see further into the future

6253383 the climate crisis is significantly worse and unfolding more rapidly than those on the pessimistic side of the ipcc projections had warned us

6253387 but she made it very clear shes really not counting on it and she was urging all of her supporters to get beyond the speculation
6253388 it would be such a shocker at this point because so many people have written it off
6253389 im not saying its what he would do but if he has quietly kept her in the mix it would have a powerful effect to kind of come out of the blue
6253390 it is only a matter of time before the growing army of unemployed and underemployed turns from restless to violent
6253391 the situation in the pacific is a complex and long standing one while its easy to point at the problems its far harder to offer up workable solutions
6253392 about 80 percent of the pacifics population growth is found in the low growth group of islands where employment is rare and living standards are not rising
6253393 but even high guest worker numbers of 50 000 a year for australia and 25 000 for new zealand would not help the employment problems of papua new guinea fiji and the solomon islands
6253394 for exactly the sort of reasons that are highlighted in this report
6253395 its been a recognised fact that good governance relies on well educated civil servants in pacific states and working on raising education standards from the bottom up is a way of bringing about that
6253396 these are big issues that cant be sold overnight even by chucking twice as much money at them they require long term planning and implementation of projects
6253397 for example the work being done in education now isnt going to reap benefits for many many years but we accept that
6253398 our strategy centres on helping pacific partners to create an environment which supports sustainable economic growth delivering long term benefits
6253399 to bring the godfather of heavy metal to our event is a dream come true
6253400 an incredible fight card combined with ozzys live performance our fight in las vegas will be an unforgettable event
6253401 i look forward to seeing the fighters get roughed up a bit performing in las vegas is always a good time
6253402 bidens son is a lawyer who would be nowhere near the front lines
6253403 for mccains son it was either the army or jail thats why mccain rarely mentions he son in iraq
6253404 i didnt decide to run for president to start a national crusade for the political reforms i believed in or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism in truth i wanted to be president because it had become my ambition to be president
6253405 why is chelsea clinton so ugly because her father is janet reno
6253406 half of dems nationwide agree that hillarys act of putting her name in nomination you know that heinous scheming act at the heart of hillarys plot to steal the convention for herself think it will help unify the party only 28 disagree
6253407 i believe her testimony could have changed the course of history now others believed that she would hurt anita hill
6253408 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
6253409 they told me there are going to be resources here
6253410 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
6253411 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
6253412 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
6253413 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
6253414 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
6253415 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
6253416 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
6253417 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
6253418 an early balanced documented study in detail of the operations of lees army in the year 1862

6253421 he didnt exercise sufficient care in his work with the office to avoid getting in a mess like that
6253422 currently in washington county we have over 870 children on the waiting list for head start if seven of those kids who dont make it into head start end up in prison that 10 million is going to go fully for their care in prison at the rate of about 50 000 per person per year
6253423 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
6253424 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
6253425 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
6253426 democracy and socialism have nothing in common but one word equality but notice the difference while democracy seeks equality in liberty socialism seeks equality in restraint and servitude
6253427 if you wanted to attack the u s bring us to our knees you wouldnt even have to come here
6253428 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
6253429 we send it to a few friends and we send it to the people who dont like us very well
6253430 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war
6253431 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
6253432 i want to appeal to every single listener out in the world
6253433 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6253434 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6253435 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6253436 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6253437 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6253438 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6253439 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6253440 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6253441 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6253442 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6253443 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
6253444 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6253445 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6253446 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6253447 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6253448 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6253449 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6253450 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
6253451 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
6253452 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
6253453 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
6253454 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
6253455 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
6253456 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
6253457 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned

6253460 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
6253461 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
6253462 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
6253463 must honor the science behind the 21 law which unequivocally shows that the 21 law has reduced drunk driving and underage and binge drinking
6253464 t he decline began in the year 1969 the year in which several landmark improvements were made in the accident avoidance and crash protection features of passenger cars
6253465 because the cost is suffered by the benchmark index itself it will remain hidden from index investors who simply focus on the explicit fees of index funds and their performance relative to the index yet it represents an unambiguous drag on returns and it can be avoided with simple index neutral strategies which have otherwise similar risk and return characteristics
6253466 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
6253467 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
6253468 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
6253469 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
6253470 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
6253471 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
6253472 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
6253473 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
6253474 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
6253475 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
6253476 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
6253477 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
6253478 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
6253479 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
6253480 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
6253481 some people may also want to tell us the of growth investments and of value investments they want
6253482 reits looked great during the real estate boom bubble but why should i believe that will be true moving forward
6253483 why would i pay off a 5 875 apr 30 year mortgage instead of investing the money
6253484 i favor the pristine and classic all u s stock market and all bond market approach
6253485 many pensions belong to working class people without other savings who will be counting pennies in their retirement for these people keeping up with the price of eggs is very important and investing in equities over the past decade has turned out to be a pretty gruesome decision im not sure if its possible for a pension fund to benchmark a food basket but there are lots of fund managers out there who are responsible for the life savings and wellbeing of people who are going to spend their retirements living on low incomes such managers might well want to start spending less time looking at absolute returns and more time keeping an eye on the cost of living and how it might be hedged
6253486 the three factor model is as fama and french have repeatedly emphasized only a model it is not reality
6253487 i never attempt to make money on the stock market i buy on the assumption that they could close the market the next day and not reopen it for five years
6253488 unless you can watch your stock holding decline by 50 without becoming panic stricken you should not be in the stock market
6253489 unless you can watch your stock holding decline by 50 without becoming panic stricken you should not be in the stock market

6253493 we dont think we have the right kind of tools to help decision makers plan for the future
6253494 muito bom voltar a jogar em s o paulo a lusa um time grande e est me dando a oportunidade de mostrar meu futebol

6253496 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
6253497 a terceira comiss o fez justi a todas as provas j estavam nos autos e fomos absolvidos
6253498 i figured it would be me or cat osterman being that i had thrown against them already
6253499 i knew if i didnt start i would definitely come in in relief
6253500 i was thinking i didnt want to leave anything out there i did not want anything to bother me just focus
6253501 that was probably the biggest win of my life no it was the biggest win of my life
6253502 it was so huge for our team it keeps us in a position to win a gold medal
6253503 the number of superdelegates has gotten too large in relation to overall delegates
6253504 we want to give more control back to the voters everyone thinks there ought to be more weight given to the results of the elections
6253505 we believe that 95 percent is the minimally acceptable probability of success for a given initial withdrawal rate
6253506 its an absolute fact that as people get older they spend less money
6253507 classic constant 1 25 of initial real value of portfolio
6253508 classic constant 1 25 of initial real value of portfolio
6253509 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
6253510 we believe that 95 percent is the minimally acceptable probability of success for a given initial withdrawal rate
6253511 i dont have to be perfect or have everyones approval to be happy or to consider myself worthwhile it
6253512 we decided to wait till shes born and then were going to get a look at her and well probably keep debating it
6253513 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
6253514 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
6253515 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
6253516 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
6253517 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
6253518 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
6253519 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
6253520 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
6253521 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
6253522 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
6253523 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
6253524 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
6253525 those who dont read the newspapers are better off than those
6253526 takes note of architecture and other things that provide a benefit to the city while he is on vacation
6253527 the citizens mess is just going to get worse there has been blatant incompetence in running this state company and i want nothing to do with it
6253528 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
6253529 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
6253530 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
6253531 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
6253532 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
6253533 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
6253534 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
6253535 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
6253536 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
6253537 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
6253538 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
6253539 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
6253540 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
6253541 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
6253542 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
6253543 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
6253544 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
6253545 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
6253546 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
6253547 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
6253548 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
6253549 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
6253550 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
6253551 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
6253552 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
6253553 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
6253554 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
6253555 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
6253556 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
6253557 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
6253558 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
6253559 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
6253560 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
6253561 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
6253562 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
6253563 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
6253564 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
6253565 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
6253566 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
6253567 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
6253568 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
6253569 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
6253570 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
6253571 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
6253572 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
6253573 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
6253574 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
6253575 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
6253576 given the uncertainty surrounding the collection and ownership of certain assets and the valuation and nature of certain liabilities to the extent that vick may show more liabilities than assets this is not an admission that vick was insolvent at the petition date or any time prior to the petition date
6253577 he said after the last eight years even our dogs and cats have learned that elections matter
6253578 it was so relevant to what we are doing here
6253579 we came up with something funny to fuse our interests in dogs and politics
6253580 we figured there were many dog afficionados who are also interested in politics
6253581 she was a stray but she worked her way up
6253582 well just be sending each other e mails at two in the morning instead of two in the afternoon
6253583 capitol briefing sincerely apologizes for the confusion and will continue to update
6253584 i think theres a lot of soul searching going on here about this
6253585 i think the formal process kicked off with the establishment of a nato georgia commission
6253586 i think its right to see georgian and ukrainian membership as part of a process to build up these countries as a permanent fixture not just as an accident
6253587 an important signal but there is also important substance to it
6253588 in practical terms nato is offering close cooperation with the georgian government and the georgian military
6253589 and announced the setting up of the nato georgia commission
6253590 what were seeing now is a clear regrouping and also again some kind of deception campaign saying look were moving out
6253591 they are going around now and trying to grab new strategic areas in georgia
6253592 we still believe this is not all that this is just a beginning
6253593 dreaming to turn my country into chechnya into some kind of insurgency warfare field where they go around and operate with brutal force
6253594 the last thing im worried about is about my political future right now
6253595 i just walked right on past him to the bedroom and got my gun
6253596 i said what are you doing in my house he just kept saying he didnt do it
6253597 this generation of prosperity had put millions of americans in new homes and millions of new cars on our roads
6253598 president richard nixon also called for greater efficiency standards at the federal level and for exploration of energy using the best options they had at the time extracting oil from shale and tar sands and developing cleaner coal technology
6253599 but when the same demagogues in the middle east who created the supply shortage decided to increase supply once again all the initiatives to use less and produce more energy were abandoned now 36 years later we again face a crisis an oil crisis a carbon crisis and a conservation crisis
6253600 the vehicles we drive have gotten bigger heavier and less efficient our homes have gotten larger and require ever more power to heat and cool our lives have become filled with new technologies that have changed the world for the better but increased the thirst for greater quantities of energy
6253601 this emergency far more complex than the one we faced three and a half decades ago harms our economy threatens our national security and pollutes to our environment
6253602 we are here today to accept the challenge of creating a clean energy revolution
6253603 the imperative is to end the drain of the american treasury both public and private which flow to the hands of volatile governments who control the worlds oil supply ultimately our vision is to bequeath to our children and our childrens children the livable planet that they deserve
6253604 if past is prologue and it is we know that this clean energy revolution will be complicated
6253605 so here in las vegas on august 19 2008 we are gathered gathered to share what we know where we are and what we do next
6253606 today in nevada there are 57 operating renewable energy projects producing 400 megawatts of electricity
6253607 our host the university of nevada las vegas is known for its high energy basketball and in the future it will be known as the leader in clean energy
6253608 look to nearby nellis air force base and you will find the worlds largest photovoltaic plant which provides more than 25 percent of the bases power
6253609 the first geothermal plant in america was built in nevada in 1984
6253610 unfortunately further work this year has been blocked by those creating a distraction by insisting that we talk about nothing but coastal drilling
6253611 even then it will be a drop in the global bucket
6253612 when people in the future look upon the polluted world of 2008 they will see a partnership of two politically differing individuals who came together to show responsible leadership
6253613 oil will be one part of our energy puzzle for years to come as we develop and produce the technologies that will one day render it unnecessary
6253614 congress should pass a long term extension of tax incentives for private sector entrepreneurs who are standing by ready to invest billions of dollars in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects
6253615 all of this will happen if we grasp the enormous economic opportunity this shift to renewables will create
6253616 for example if just 20 percent of our nations power came from renewables by 2020 we would create hundreds of thousands of direct jobs and save consumers many billions of dollars in lower bills
6253617 if we choose to embrace this challenge we can fundamentally change our world which will benefit every creature and person that inhabits it
6253618 we are taking the results and recommendations of this energy summit to the democratic and republican national conventions
6253619 and when we meet again next year i have every expectation that we will do so with a president a congress and a nation finally ready to fully embrace the great energy opportunities that lie ahead
6253620 is there a master user out there in the universe who controls our lives for whatever reason i suppose known only to it
6253621 hard work isnt enough you can be the most talented person on the team and if you dont have a bit of luck on your side it means nothing
6253622 if i can trust that things happen for a reason where my career is concerned why cant i just trust that things will happen when theyre meant to with my love life
6253623 wow here are two people who dont want to be alone and whove settled down with each other because thats the thing youre supposed to do when you get to a certain age and youre just sick and tired of the dating game
6253624 throughout the course of the day and into this evening congresswoman tubbs jones medical condition declined
6253625 stephanie tubbs jones was a gifted trailblazer with a spirit as big as the city she loved
6253626 punched a clock day in and day out one as a skycap the other as a factory worker
6253627 your best friends are going to hurt you every once in a while you must forgive them for that
6253628 sometimes i think we dont need anyone else in the world but then again who would we talk about
6253629 people may not remember exactly what you did or what you said but they will always remember how you made them feel
6253630 friendship is born at that moment when one person says to another
6253631 we have been working pretty closely together on georgia and issues related to afghanistan
6253632 the article he miliband wrote in the guardian was an article that any member of the cabinet could have written or i could have written these are debates that all members of the cabinet have got to be involved in there is nothing in the article that is a problem because we have got to enter a debate with the other parties about the different futures for our country
6253633 we are getting on with the job look what the people of britain are concerned about is what is happening to their gas and electricity bills what is happening to the oil price and the petrol price at the pumps these are the issues they want us to deal with you will see us dealing with some of these issues as we come back in september
6253634 nobody ever makes advance announcements on things like that but we are concentrating on the economic issues
6253635 they are very excited we have been watching on television it has been really exciting i dont think the british public expected that we would do so well and i think they are really delighted that we have
6253636 the seemingly softer tone to the committees discussion in keeping with a more muted outlook in the inflation report does seem to have pretty much ruled out any prospect of a rate hike which was already slim as it would risk an unnecessarily deep downturn
6253637 although we envisage the first rate cut next year there is every chance that the mpc begins to cut as early as november especially if commodity prices continue to fall and economic activity falters as expected
6253638 concerns about demand were a more important factor in restraining investment than restrictions in the supply of credit although credit was becoming harder to obtain
6253639 the short length and complexity of the new franchise is seen to favour the incumbent

6253649 coach junron doesnt talk a lot but when he says something it means something and you can feel that inner strength just his professionalism and the way he treated everybody with respect and class but he could also be that silent assassin so people know that even if hes quiet he can be an assassin if he has to

6253651 in order for us to be able to provide the services for our constituency it became necessary to make adjustments
6253652 were not in the business of making money were in the business of recovering costs for the tax payer
6253653 i realize the need the money the towns expanding people want the service but its gotta be a service people can afford waters a necessity it keeps the town looking nice if you just drive down the side streets and look at the burned up lawns you see they cant afford it now
6253654 i dont like it basically its like everything is going up powers going up everything i dont know how everyones going to be able to afford it
6253655 this morning when he got ready for school he said mom im the last class that gets to be a fourth grader at the old school and then at the new school

6253658 i have a kindergarten a first grader and a fourth grader it seems like its a great safe place for families and for kids
6253659 i think thats great i think the more safe you can make it for your kids the better it is
6253660 trying to wrap themselves in businesss embrace by wooing some of the best known chief executives
6253661 and theres barely been enough money to pay for toilet paper and paper towels in the bathroom and keep the lawns mowed
6253662 weve gotten a few complaints but mostly people are excited to have things improved
6253663 theres so many things that are just run down so thats our first priority is fixing up the bathrooms and then from there well continue to improve the park
6253664 i think you can go to a lot of other places you dont have to pay
6253665 if they have to charge a few bucks to do that i dont see why not rick its not that big of a deal to you daniel no for 5 you can come out here until 10pm
6253666 i was glad that i had a little cash in my wallet cause sometimes when you leave the house to go to someplace like this you dont want to bring a lot of money and leave it in the car
6253667 i want gary glitter to be controlled whilst hes here and i dont want him to be able to go anywhere else in the world in order to abuse children
6253668 it is up to the chinese authorities what action they take next
6253669 that interception we got last year happened to get us to where we wanted to be the super bowl whether he came back or didnt it didnt make much difference
6253670 we are going to go out there the same way and do what we do on defense keep them from scoring and eliminate the big plays
6253671 i know he has a big gun and tries to make big plays and we are going to try to put pressure on the quarterback and try to eliminate big plays
6253672 i just happened to read the route downfield and was able to undercut it and make them turn the ball over
6253673 i didnt know what he was doing at that time
6253674 im trying to watch the receiver i was able to get my head back around and played the ball in the air secured it and went down and helped us get to the super bowl
6253675 i never changed last year from the beginning of the season
6253676 i am still working hard doing the things that i normally do i go out and try to get better
6253677 hopefully i get to play a long time and make a lot more interceptions
6253678 hopefully i can forget about that one and make some bigger ones thats my goal

6253684 we rethought those plans and came up with a way to put a lid on the cells instead of the razor wire
6253685 the important thing is this has to function as a normal jail
6253686 the nature of jail is to create an environment where you can maintain security and order and one of our primary charges is the care and custody of inmates

6253691 if people call me a lesbian because i have short hair and i wear jeans instead of dresses then by all means run with it i think its hilarious i like guys
6253692 we decided to do a cover on this disc and we didnt want to do what every other band is doing these days and take a pop or rock song from the 80s
6253693 we figured a song by a band with real metal cred would do best for us this song never got the attention it deserved its an amazingly well written song and even though its not the most complex song nevermore has done it is in my opinion one of their best we ran the idea by nevermore and they gave us their blessing so we were very happy to have the original artists behind it i couldnt be happier with the way it came out
6253694 we have been assuming that the ways in which emotions are organized in the brain are essentially similar in men and women
6253695 im kind of hurt that you forgot i hate sushi

6253886 you may have noticed that all of the nicer looking cups were taken up first leaving behind the plainer and cheaper ones while it is only natural for you to want only the best for yourselves that is actually the source of much of your stress related problems
6253887 be assured that the cup itself adds no quality to the coffee in fact the cup merely disguises or dresses up what we drink what each of you really wanted was coffee not a cup but you instinctively went for the best cups then you began eyeing each others cups
6253888 now consider this life is coffee jobs money and position in society are merely cups they are just tools to shape and contain life and the type of cup we have does not truly define nor change the quality of the life we live often by concentrating only on the cup we fail to enjoy the coffee that god has provided us god brews the coffee but he does not supply the cups enjoy your coffee
6253889 adverse consequences for passengers and airlines a principal cause is their common ownership by baa
6253890 we will continue to point out to the commission the many areas where we believe its analysis is flawed and its remedies would be disproportionate and counter productive
6253891 the commission risks delaying that delivery of new runways and making better customer service less not more likely
6253892 may not be serving well the interests of either airlines or passengers
6253893 the failures by baa in the public eye whether its luggage handling or delays is what prompted this but its not just a hit at baa its also calling on the government and regulatory body for a significant change
6253894 they have said what everyone knows that our airports arent working and that baa and regulation arent working
6253895 simply selling a monopoly airport from one greedy highly indebted capitalist to another will benefit no one apart from the deal makers in the city
6253896 a lot of the procedural issues necessary for instant replay to be implemented need to be worked out
6253897 im not going to go through these one by one i will tell you that on a number of them the comments are simply not accurate
6253898 for example weve had an understanding with the wua for some time that the crew chief and the crew chief only would be the one responsible for reviewing the video and making the decision on instant replay
6253899 there are other issues that remain to be worked out it is my general policy that i dont comment when im trying to bargain but i remain confident that were gong to be able to make a deal
6253900 thus there will be a lack of transparency and obviousness for the public as to what is going on when instant replay is under way
6253901 there may be situations where the umpires will have to leave the field in shifts so that everyone can view the video while leaving the requisite number of umpires on the field
6253902 this could create a laurel and hardy effect and may cause delay of game problems
6253903 he doesnt trust the teams to behave themselves in their absence
6253904 the umpires raised concerns and brought potential problems to solomons attention at least six weeks ago
6253905 throughout the course of the day and into this evening
6253906 including planning for an upcoming forum on electoral reform scheduled for september 4 2008 at cleveland state university

6253909 hillary clinton was lucky to have a supporter like her
6253910 that is all i have to report guys i have not another single thing i can tell you
6253911 i think its probably down between evan bayh and senator biden
6253912 and i know john mccain his seriousness his love of country hell select the person who is best and if that person happens to be among other things pro choice the party will support that
6253913 if john mccain goes with his gut and picks joe lieberman itll be a gamechanger and in a positive way
6253914 itll send a message that he is the real centrist in this race
6253915 and if i say anything more than that i guarantee you theres going to be another one of these firestorms

6254172 yes tanaka san we are not only competing against other companies we are also competing against our own company the total amount of our earning will compare against the health products if either of us wins we will get a holiday trip to hawaii
6254173 but then i heard that their 1st manager is in charge of it it was said that she never lose any challenge that was send to her its going to be hard for us to win them
6254174 if so then we will be the first one to beat her down
6254175 knowing by her character i believe she will be coming in soon
6254176 tanaka san im going to put you in charge of this project
6254177 yes you are in charge of it dont huh me
6254178 no more buts you know her earlier than anyone of us here you are the most suitable to take up the challenge i will be busy working on the international project
6254179 later we are going to have a meeting with the rest of the people
6254180 but then i heard that their 1st manager is in charge of it it was said that she never lose any challenge that was send to her its going to be hard for us to win them
6254181 yes you are in charge of it dont huh me
6254182 hi everybody looks like we are going to compete with each other during the beauty and health convention
6254183 hi takahashi san so you are going to be in charge for your department
6254184 oh no tanaka san is going to be in charge
6254185 oh looks like i have to change my strategies of winning the competitions
6254186 so i guess its time for me to go and think of a new strategy
6254187 hes been a valuable employee with us for quite a long time
6254188 he was the first person who became infected in this outbreak
6254189 it is just devastating for the last five weeks i guess his family has virtually had to make a daily vigil with him against overwhelming odds
6254190 d ave stop stop will you stop dave will you stop dave
6254191 i was a lit major in college and used to be a voracious book reader
6254192 what if i do all my reading on the web not so much because the way i read has changed i e im just seeking convenience but because the way i think has changed
6254193 i now have almost totally lost the ability to read and absorb a longish article on the web or in print
6254194 ive lost the ability to do that even a blog post of more than three or four paragraphs is too much to absorb i skim it
6254195 perhaps you will through this instrument even take to a new idiom
6254196 thoughts in music and language often depend on the quality of pen and paper
6254197 the process works this way when i sit down to write a letter or start the first draft of an article i simply type on the keyboard and the words appear on the screen
6254198 our writing equipment takes part in the forming of our thoughts
6254199 changed from arguments to aphorisms from thoughts to puns from rhetoric to telegram style
6254200 has the ability to reprogram itself on the fly altering the way it functions
6254201 disassociated time from human events and helped create the belief in an independent world of mathematically measurable sequences
6254202 remains an impoverished version of the older one for it rests on a rejection of those direct experiences that formed the basis for and indeed constituted the old reality
6254203 the gradual substitution of science for rule of thumb throughout the mechanic arts
6254204 to organize the worlds information and make it universally accessible and useful
6254205 understands exactly what you mean and gives you back exactly what you want
6254206 the ultimate search engine is something as smart as people or smarter
6254207 for us working on search is a way to work on artificial intelligence
6254208 certainly if you had all the worlds information directly attached to your brain or an artificial brain that was smarter than your brain youd be better off
6254209 really trying to build artificial intelligence and to do it on a large scale
6254210 be thought very knowledgeable when they are for the most part quite ignorant
6254211 filled with the conceit of wisdom instead of real wisdom
6254212 most of the arguments made against the printing press were correct even prescient
6254213 pancake people spread wide and thin as we connect with that vast network of information accessed by the mere touch of a button
6254214 i almost ruled out reading this book when i read the authors to me bold statement on page 225
6254215 being at times a very fast poet i gasped when i read that assertion
6254216 the fuselage is destroyed the plane burned i have seen a kilometre of charred land and few whole pieces of the fuselage
6254217 the plane was all broken up all full of bodies nothing remains that looks like a plane
6254218 its horrific everythings burned its a horror i dont want to tell you i dont want to tell you
6254219 its the most like hell ive ever seen the bodies were boiling we were burned trying to remove them
6254220 we are not aware of any australians on board at this stage but we are still liaising with hospitals local authorities and airlines to find out if any australians have been affected
6254221 sas is doing everything possible to help passengers and next of kin and to assist spanish authorities
6254222 although fuel prices have eased over the past month they have not declined to levels that will sustain the current level of profitability and fuel and economic conditions continue to be uncertain
6254223 however assuming no further deterioration in economic conditions qantas expects its 2008 09 profit before tax to be broadly in line with analyst consensus forecasts
6254224 the rapid rise in fuel costs since december last year is unprecedented and the impact has been felt across the aviation industry and the world economy
6254225 we have reacted quickly and have already announced a number of steps to reduce costs adjust capacity and increase fares
6254226 regarding the loyalty business qantas is well advanced in its preparations for a partial australian ipo subject to market conditions
6254227 the result included revenue of 850 million primarily from the redemption of qantas frequent flyer points for flight and other awards
6254228 total costs for the period were 721 million with the majority of costs being the purchase of airline seats from qantas group airline businesses
6254229 we understand the level of scrutiny we are being subjected to at present
6254230 we will work through these issues and implement any changes that may be required but our commitment to safety should never be questioned
6254231 we were considering moving our debt to this other card but we decided to give you the opportunity to keep our business
6254232 as much as any of them he was a joy to watch you never knew what was coming next it could be an underhand pass for a completion it could be a laser for 50 yards that made your jaw drop it could be a terribly forced pass that made his coaches wince
6254233 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6254234 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6254235 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6254236 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6254237 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6254238 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6254239 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6254240 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6254241 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6254242 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6254243 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6254244 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6254245 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6254246 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6254247 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6254248 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6254249 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6254250 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6254251 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6254252 i almost ruled out reading this book when i read the authors to me bold statement on page 225
6254253 being at times a very fast poet i gasped when i read that assertion
6254254 there are a tremendous number of first time voters who will be crucial in this election and youth vote 08 will provide direct insight into the issues they are facing along with their mindset
6254255 pollsters are saying the youth vote will decide this election
6254256 theres always been control systems for different facial movements but say in the past you had a dial for controlling whether an eye was open or closed and in one frame you set the eye at 3 4 open the next 1 2 open etc this is like achieving that degree of control with much finer movements
6254257 conservatives were supposed to be the bigger problem for mccain
6254258 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6254259 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6254260 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6254261 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6254262 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6254263 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6254264 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6254265 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6254266 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6254267 this allows the icc the opportunity to plan with certainty the icc world twenty20 2009 as well as giving scotland plenty of preparation time ahead of the tournament
6254268 hands on with the lenovo w700 post with some info on price
6254269 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6254270 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6254271 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6254272 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6254273 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6254274 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6254275 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6254276 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6254277 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6254278 it might take awhile to grow on some people but the response weve gotten has been great so far
6254279 changing a logo is a huge undertaking and a major commitment if youre not convinced youre doing the right thing its best to walk away but we love this look and the new direction it gives us
6254280 being the dinosaur i am i will admit i dont understand the need to change logos
6254281 i didnt even understand the third jersey concept until 20 years after it was around in hockey i love our old logo and i think its very recognizable people seem to want change and this will be a new beginning for what were trying to do to improve and change the hockey club
6254282 this is symbolic yeah it takes a little getting used to for me i try not to let my old thinking get in the way were trying to get into the new millennium and our staff has a good feel for what our sponsors and fans want i know i didnt want to see our old logo disappear because for me it represented all the great things that have happened here
6254283 hes been willing to listen when i bring a good case to him about why we should try something new like this oh we had some discussions
6254284 i like the new look i think its sharp and points in the direction we want to go
6254285 i think it will speak to the players and im guessing theyll be first in line to get the hats and t shirts i know when we brought in the third jersey when guys like nick drazenovic and greg gardner were here they were all excited and really liked it i think this logo is above and beyond that one
6254286 i think you need to do things like this to keep things fresh and exciting for the hockey club and i think the players will really like it
6254287 look around professional teams and this will allow the kind of access these players have to learn to get used to as they progress in their careers
6254288 dressing room access for the media like they have in the pros no i dont think it will go that far yet
6254289 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6254290 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6254291 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6254292 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6254293 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6254294 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6254295 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6254296 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6254297 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6254298 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6254299 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6254300 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6254301 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6254302 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6254303 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6254304 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6254305 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6254306 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6254307 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6254308 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6254309 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6254310 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6254311 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6254312 while we continue to see volatility in international markets and increases in the average cost of long term funding we have experienced some short term funding relief which we are keen to pass on to our customers
6254313 while i am pleased to make todays undertaking our medium and long term funding and our retail deposit base represent the greatest proportion of our funding costs and the average cost of these sources of funding continue to increase
6254314 the recent fall in short term funding costs provides an opportunity to undertake to move rates in line with the rba decision but future interest rate decisions will need to reflect an assessment of all the cost of funding factors
6254315 all australian banks are reliant on offshore funding and increases in the average cost of long term funding are likely to be with us for some time
6254316 therefore any consideration that the federal government can give to enhance the attractiveness of retail bank deposits will help reduce overall funding costs and assist in lowering mortgages rates
6254317 clearly we would love to pass through the full 25 basis points drop if that were to occur but well need to factor in all of those issues at that time
6254318 consistent with conditions in the broader economy advertising markets have slowed in the new financial year
6254319 we have limited visibility on how well advertising markets will perform this half
6254320 overall these are a very satisfactory set of results in the face of declining earnings for our sydney and melbourne metropolitan newspapers in australia and tough trading conditions particularly in new zealand
6254321 these results highlight the successful implementation of our strategy of diversification of revenue investment in digital earnings growth and constant focus on operational improvement to drive earnings per share growth
6254322 wed encourage anyone who thinks they may have seen joan to contact police
6254323 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6254324 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6254325 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6254326 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6254327 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6254328 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6254329 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6254330 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6254331 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6254332 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6254333 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6254334 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6254335 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
6254336 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
6254337 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6254338 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6254339 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6254340 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6254341 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6254342 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6254343 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6254344 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6254345 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6254346 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6254347 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6254348 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6254349 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6254350 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6254351 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6254352 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6254353 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6254354 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6254355 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6254356 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6254357 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6254358 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6254359 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6254360 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6254361 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6254362 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6254363 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6254364 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6254365 this is a planning took where all things are going
6254366 invocando la protecci n de dios fuente de toda raz n y justicia
6254367 y as pa no morir de hambre buscaban los animales de los men ndez por eso los mataba men ndez
6254368 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer
6254369 despu s de veinti n a os de explotarla trajeron unos pocos indios ac pero onas no vinieron m s que tres mujeres la paula la raquel y la petronila fueron las nicas que vinieron ac hombres no vino ninguno
6254370 detritus de la sociedad seres sin escr pulos y sin entra as que en pos del dinero y de la fortuna ca an en punta arenas atra dos por la f cil impunidad
6254371 sangre del gaucho y del indio s lo sirve para abonar la tierra
6254372 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
6254373 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
6254374 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
6254375 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6254376 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6254377 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6254378 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6254379 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
6254380 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
6254381 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6254382 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6254383 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6254384 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6254385 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6254386 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6254387 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6254388 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6254389 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6254390 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6254391 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6254392 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6254393 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6254394 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6254395 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6254396 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6254397 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6254398 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6254399 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6254400 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6254401 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6254402 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6254403 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6254404 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
6254405 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
6254406 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
6254407 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6254408 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6254409 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
6254410 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6254411 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
6254412 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
6254413 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
6254414 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6254415 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6254416 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6254417 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6254418 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6254419 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6254420 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6254421 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6254422 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6254423 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6254424 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6254425 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6254426 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6254427 my eleven year old is a pain in the ass and i havent had a proper orgasm in eleven years
6254428 saat ini kita masih mencari alamat dan kontak dari keluarga korban belum ada pihak keluarga yang menghubungi
6254429 s de alguien un seat blanco aparcado delante del mio m s que nada porqu llego
6254430 hay que ser idiota para venir a escuchar a alguien a quien han elegido en privado para que les robe
6254431 we decided this was the time to pull the trigger on developing a mobile communications center
6254432 a lot of public safety primarily fire and police and sheriff agencies have this kind of platforms but were the first ems agency to get into this
6254433 he bought non refundable tickets of course hes going to go
6254434 go to australia take my ticket clear your mind and ill be here when you get back
6254435 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales
6254436 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
6254437 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6254438 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6254439 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6254440 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6254441 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
6254442 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
6254443 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
6254444 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6254445 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6254446 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6254447 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6254448 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6254449 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6254450 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6254451 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6254452 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6254453 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6254454 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6254455 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6254456 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6254457 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6254458 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6254459 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6254460 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6254461 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
6254462 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
6254463 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6254464 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6254465 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6254466 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6254467 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6254468 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6254469 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
6254470 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
6254471 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
6254472 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
6254473 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
6254474 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
6254475 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
6254476 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
6254477 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
6254478 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
6254479 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
6254480 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
6254481 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
6254482 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
6254483 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
6254484 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
6254485 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
6254486 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
6254487 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6254488 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
6254489 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6254490 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6254491 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6254492 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6254493 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6254494 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6254495 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6254496 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6254497 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6254498 during a team meeting three years ago a meeting we have annually i told them i dont know how many games youre going to win but try to stay in the games in the first quarter
6254499 last year i told them that i believe theyll be in the game in the fourth quarter more than ever this year i said fellas i believe youre going to be winning more games in the fourth quarter or have the ball with the chance to win in the fourth quarter more than weve had in years
6254500 i dont know who picks us or where or when
6254501 i dont think we finished fifth last year so i dont see that how anybody can think intuitively that finishing fifth is going to sit right with this team
6254502 10 months ago at this time was the exact date of the injury
6254503 i wasnt sure id be in this situation its special to be here as a senior and being healthy enough to play
6254504 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6254505 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6254506 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6254507 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6254508 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6254509 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6254510 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6254511 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6254512 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6254513 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6254514 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6254515 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6254516 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6254517 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6254518 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6254519 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6254520 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6254521 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6254522 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6254523 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6254524 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6254525 weve ruled out any illnesses that would cause him to miss any playing time
6254526 weve got a little bit more work to do but were optimistic that hes going to be able to make the opener thats great news for him and great news for our team
6254527 if theres been one guy whos been a surprise he has to be it hes got speed to turn the corner hes physical inside youd have to convince me right now that hes not been our most productive back hes definitely been a pleasant surprise
6254528 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6254529 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6254530 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6254531 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6254532 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6254533 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6254534 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6254535 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6254536 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6254537 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6254538 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6254539 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6254540 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6254541 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6254542 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6254543 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6254544 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6254545 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6254546 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6254547 she couldnt eat anything when she was discharged from the hospital
6254548 but now they are encouraging her to eat by mouth now shes eating a lot without her tube it was a big improvement
6254549 she has problems in her lungs problems in her esophagus she couldnt eat at all for the first two months
6254550 she couldnt make any sound now shes very loud at home
6254551 san jose and the bay area are some of the most under served areas in the state and theres a whole lot of kids not getting the services they should be

6254558 the doctor said i couldnt leave her not even a moment because she would have problems breathing

6254562 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6254563 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6254564 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6254565 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6254566 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6254567 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6254568 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6254569 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6254570 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

6254575 victorias wine industry is a key contributor to the states economy with an annual turnover of about 1 3 billion and more than 650 million worth of wine exports in 2006
6254576 there are 3000 growers more that 850 wineries and 650 cellar doors across victorias 21 wine regions employing hundreds of people and boosting tourism across regional and rural victoria
6254577 this study will provide valuable information to the industry measuring the impact of drought skills shortages and climate change on victorias wineries
6254578 the study will also give the brumby government a clearer understanding of the contribution the victorian wine industry makes to the economy
6254579 barack obamas ad is ridiculous because of john mccain corruption was exposed and people like jack abramoff went to jail
6254580 however if barack obama wants to have a discussion about truly questionable associations lets start with his relationship with the unrepentant terrorist william ayers at whose home obamas political career was reportedly launched
6254581 the question now is will barack obama immediately call on the university of illinois to release all of the records they are currently withholding to shed further light on senator obamas relationship with this unrepentant terrorist

6254594 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6254595 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6254596 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6254597 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6254598 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6254599 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6254600 you take anybodys life and you dont know how it affects the rest of the family your friends
6254601 it takes a part of your heart out that no matter what happens youll never have that part again its hard
6254602 i wanted to be strong for my family and being in the field at that time i thought i was standing up for them when he told me that they had actually made an arrest i was glad i was sitting down because it really overcame me
6254603 there are no words to express how grateful we are for what theyve done i mean there are no words thank you thank you
6254604 the detectives who work for me put in the effort and kept at it we dont forget we dont forget any of our victims
6254605 i dont know how i will make it through that but i will i have to ive waited for this ive prayed for this
6254606 he was a great kid you know i think thats what keeps us going he was a good kid
6254607 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6254608 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6254609 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6254610 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6254611 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6254612 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6254613 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6254614 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

6254628 the children delivered via gestational surrogacy are healthy and already under rickys full time care
6254629 ricky is elated to begin this new chapter in his life as a parent and will be spending the remainder of the year out of the public spotlight in order to spend time with his children
6254630 we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light
6254631 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
6254632 musharraf had lost his utility as a useful asset for the war on terror
6254633 and did not want the us in pakistan ayub khan kicked the americans out of pakistan and closed down the badabar airforce base
6254634 the pakistanis looked me in the eye and lied to me
6254635 the americans had been putting pressure on islamabad since february for him to get its act together against the taliban and al qaeda and pakistans foreign minister shah mahmood qureshi and pakistans ambassador to washington husain haqqani always told washington that the government could not move forward independently because of musharraf
6254636 hence musharraf was politely told by washington through various channels to gracefully resign but he remained defiant and ultimately washington pulled its support of him and the ruling coalition moved for his impeachment which forced him to resign
6254637 the army will play the same role it played from 1996 to 1998
6254638 the american role has always been paramount in pakistans politics the late general zia ul haq was defiant of washingtons interests and he faced an accidental death in a mysterious plane accident in 1988 had musharraf tried to exercise his constitutional powers to dissolve the assemblies he would also have been obstructing american interests in the region and would have faced a zia like fate
6254639 now the americans will have to use the two remaining national assets for their interests the political parties and the army chief
6254640 zardari because of corruption cases that have been leveled against him can be easily manipulated and therefore he will act obediently on their advice
6254641 i suspect that kiani is already part of their game
6254642 yes he could be the one but asfandyar failed to uphold his promised role to control militancy in the tribal areas without resort to military operations
6254643 in my opinion nawab attaullah mengal a baloch politician should be the president of the country given the recent mistreatments done in balochistan province in the name of military operations
6254644 there was no reason to use such brute force in a tribal area like bajaur
6254645 said gul compared to north and south waziristan where militancy is deep rooted the terrain is much more hospitable in bajaur
6254646 the only reason for such military action was to destroy the talibans approaches to kunar where american forces are all out to get the taliban kunar province lies in the northeast and connects to kabul previously the taliban were focused only on southeastern provinces
6254647 this is the role washington wants the pakistani army to play the cost is paid by pakistanis and 250 000 people were displaced during the bajaur operation
6254648 gul added pointing to the fact that in terms of security issues especially those relating to afghanistan pakistan is still joined at the hip with the us for which it has since 2001 received over us 10 billion in aid and military equipment

6254658 as you would expect we have been in communication with the companies for months to receive updates and weve been communicating with their regulator and the federal reserve
6254659 we continue to be concerned about what dilution would be required to stabilize fannie and freddie and what that would leave over for existing shareholders
6254660 it could be something like a convertible preferred deal that might end up diluting shareholders but at the same time the rest of the capital structure winds up doing ok
6254661 the market sees that takeover as further illustrating the guarantee of the government
6254662 what mudd didnt say is that the company is too leveraged to a depreciating asset housing and losses are off the charts and there are no signs of stability
6254663 that delay will only be possible if the gses continue to be able to sell discount notes and term debt at relatively stable spreads
6254664 i think in the current environment everyone is more cautious about investments
6254665 if and when a compelling opportunity came up in the us local space where we think were well suited wed have a look at that but wed be looking for a majority interest and control role
6254666 interest rates petrol prices and consumer sentiment will tend to affect the low end of the business more than the high end
6254667 while we continue to see volatility in international markets and increases in the average cost of long term funding we have experienced some short term funding relief which we are keen to pass on to our customers he said
6254668 while i am pleased to make todays undertaking our medium and long term funding and our retail deposit base represent the greatest proportion of our funding costs and the average cost of these sources of funding continue to increase
6254669 the recent fall in short term funding costs provides an opportunity to undertake to move rates in line with the rba decision but future interest rate decisions will need to reflect an assessment of all the cost of funding factors
6254670 all australian banks are reliant on offshore funding and increases in the average cost of long term funding are likely to be with us for some time
6254671 therefore any consideration that the federal government can give to enhance the attractiveness of retail bank deposits will help reduce overall funding costs and assist in lowering mortgages rates
6254672 clearly we would love to pass through the full 25 basis points drop if that were to occur but well need to factor in all of those issues at that time she told an investor briefing made similar comments the same day
6254673 our representations to government have been about trying to decouple the idea of having channel a originally mooted for narrowcast tv services and channel b planned for mobile tv as the one package and move ahead of the allocation of the mobile licence
6254674 i think theres opportunities for mobile tv in australia considering there are more mobile telephones in australia than there are people
6254675 our environment has a defining influence on the performance of our business and we were clearly not immune to these market forces in 2008
6254676 as fellow shareholders we are disappointed this years results have not been consistent with previous results which delivered total returns for our shareholders in excess of 30 per cent per annum in the decade up to 2007
6254677 a continuation of the current market conditions would again impact our revenues and profitability in 2009
6254678 yourroster is full every bloody time you attempt a trade

6254681 this research seeks to fill a gap in research about public transport attitudes and behaviour
6254682 existing research has been conducted mainly in metropolitan areas or large urban centres
6254683 they cannot support conventional mass volume public transport but there is a lot of scope for shared transport or what is known as demand responsive transport our research will focus on the potential for expansion of such options
6254684 the strength of this project lies in its international research team and this project will draw directly on expertise from australian and northern european universities
6254685 this research project will investigate ways to maximise public transport performance through improved network planning with limited resources in the specific conditions found in auckland wellington and christchurch
6254686 the wall between the known and the unknown is paper thin
6254687 the reason for changing the plan is the waves on the neuse being too rough for the boats
6254688 the developers had to add a wave attenuator and to offset the cost of that they added slips
6254689 they were trying to get the hatteras boats away from the sheraton and over here
6254690 but there have been some economic changes and there arent as many people buying hatteras boats right now
6254691 im looking at a drawing with no measurements on it
6254692 we just want to make sure we ask the questions and get it right
6254693 its nothing at all against sarah but if this had been a building she would have said we dont have sufficient information to act
6254694 if there is a drawing i want to be able to see it
6254695 there is a risk that failing to recognise when a patient could benefit from palliative care may result in a patient not getting appropriate care in the community or not being referred to specialist care when this is needed
6254696 patients not on the register may still be getting some care but by being on the register you have your full palliative needs assessed and a co ordinated plan put in place
6254697 the difficulty is often recognising when palliative care is required
6254698 there is significant variation across scotland in the availability of specialist palliative care services and how easily patients with complex needs can access these
6254699 we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light
6254700 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
6254701 all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds
6254702 we are as profoundly sceptical of this philosophy as voltaire intended us to be since dr pangloss was old pedantic and deluded maintaining his misguided beliefs even after experiencing great suffering no amount of panglossian gloss and no amount of spin cannot hide the emerging catastrophy and existing crisis in nato the troop strengths are not near the levels needed and most are not doing the job as it should be done its a classic heros quest tale a sort of ancient greek mission impossible in which the hero embarks on a sea voyage into an unknown land with a great task to achieve he is in search of a magical rams fleece which he has to find in order to reclaim his fathers kingdom from the usurper
6254703 i dont think that theres a crisis i dont think theres a risk of failure
6254704 my view is that it represents potentially the opportunity to make further progress faster in afghanistan if we had more forces there
6254705 but im realistic about politics here in europe my view is that governments here in europe understand the importance of afghanistan they just arent able to do certain kinds of things and we understand that
6254706 within nato we have agreed on a reasonable share out of tasks which in my view is very wise
6254707 our allies might think we should do more in afghanistan but our message is that we are already the third largest troop contributing nation and we are doing other things for the whole of afghanistan
6254708 i think people in britain should be aware that we lost two world wars and we have a different attitude to the question of soldiers wars and blood
6254709 of the 25 countries who have deployable forces in the nato alliance 12 of them are represented in the south and south east of afghanistan
6254710 we have now seen that the french have been prepared to deploy important forces into the south in small but significant numbers
6254711 were hearing today that other countries are prepared to increase their forces i spoke recently to the polish chief of the defence staff and they are going to increase their forces so this is a progression
6254712 the most successful political and military alliance in the world will survive this and will improve
6254713 my message to the canadian public is be a bit patient
6254714 there are no regrets to many of the actions we can take now
6254715 we are talking about improving river management and restoring the flood holding and drought proofing services of flood plains and wetlands all of which can be shown to have short term economic social and environmental pay offs
6254716 the fact that they help climate proof our river basins now is an added benefit
6254717 setting biofuel targets without considering where the water to grow biomass crops will come from is a recipe for a worsening water crisis in many regions and freshwater systems less able to cope with extreme weather events
6254718 more dams for hydropower is a recipe for even more fragmented rivers that will inhibit freshwater species the food for millions adapting to climate impacts by migrating up or down river systems
6254719 restoration of the 37 sites that make up the lower danube green corridor is estimated to cost 183 million compared to damages of 396 million from the 2005 flood and likely earnings of 85 6 million per year
6254720 this is adaptation to climate impacts even if it is not planned or labeled as adaptation
6254721 this is adaptation that involves and respects the needs of local communities and people and provides immediate benefits mr pittock said
6254722 our studies show that it is often a disaster that leads to the river restoration activities that will increase resilience to climate impacts
6254723 it would make more sense to avoid or reduce the impact of disaster by restoring and strengthening our river systems now
6254724 uncertainty is no reason for not acting on climate change impacts on vital water systems we are certain there will be significant impacts even if we cant put as many decimal points on them as we would like to

6254735 i just spare a thought for them for the last five weeks i guess it is theyve virtually had to maintain a vigil with him against overwhelming odds of any chance of success it is terrible
6254736 hes been like part of the family for a long long time
6254737 i think weve got some good news there i think shes doing quite well
6254738 the result looked pretty good and the stock has been creeping up ahead of it so there was a bit of profit taking
6254739 i really dont know of a school out here in craven that didnt get work done somewhere since last year
6254740 the new parking lot on the side of the cafeteria will not be done by monday but well likely have the students park across the road until work and paving are finished
6254741 we feel a lot better today than we did last week about the cafeteria
6254742 we had some issues hooking onto the water on n c 55 but right now we believe were ready for monday
6254743 and in addition to helping the school at j t barber we put in a new storm drain and a 500 000 gallon retention pond
6254744 its been a good thing for the community the houses would previously flood in the area when we had a big rain not now
6254745 the work at j t barber will be the closest to not being done by monday
6254746 weve been busy but when you have 24 schools and all the acreage we do theres bound to be a leak somewhere i believe well be ready for the kids

6254974 the hours i spend with you i look upon as sort of a perfumed garden a dim twilight and a fountain signing to it you and you alone make me feel that i am alive other men it is said have seen angels but i have seen thee and thou art enough
6254975 i become a waterwheel turning and tasting you as long as water moves
6254976 i miss you even more than i could have believed and i was prepared to miss you a good deal
6254977 life has taught us that love does not consist in gazing at each other but in looking outward together in the same direction
6254978 it is only with the heart that one can see rightly what is essential is invisible to the eye
6254979 there is only one happiness in life to love and be loved
6254980 sometimes your nearness takes my breath away and all the things i want to say can find no voice then in silence i can only hope my eyes will speak my heart
6254981 the more i give to thee the more i have for both are infinite
6254982 love is but the discovery of ourselves in others and the delight in the recognition
6254983 her breath is like honey spiced with cloves her mouth delicious as a ripened mango
6254984 love till dawn sunder night from day with fire dividing my delight and my desire
6254985 within you i lose myself without you i find myself wanting to become lost again
6254986 i see my fated stars in your eyes they melt me like the sun does snow
6254987 the rose speaks of love silently in a language known only to the heart
6254988 to be your friend was all i ever wanted to be your lover was all i ever dreamed
6254989 if i could reach up and hold a star for every time you made me smile i would have the whole night sky in the palm of my hand
6254990 if you love me only in my dreams let me be asleep forever
6254991 kiss me and you will see stars love me and i will give them to you
6254992 love is a dream that comes alive when we meet
6254993 the soul that can speak with its eyes can also kiss with a gaze
6254994 love is something eternal the aspect may change but not the essense
6254995 here are fruits flowers leaves and branches and here is my heart which beats only for you
6254996 when a heart finds another whats a cloud more or less in the sky
6254997 the most precious possession that ever comes to a man in this world is a womans heart
6254998 from every human being there rises a light that reaches straight to heaven and when two souls that are destined to be together find each other their streams of light flow together and a single brighter light goes forth from their united being
6254999 the most wonderful of all things in life is the discovery of another human being with whom ones relationship has a growing depth beauty and joy as the years increase this inner progressiveness of love between two human beings is a most marvelous thing it cannot be found by looking for it or by passionately wishing for it it is a sort of divine accident and the most wonderful of all things in life
6255000 love means to commit oneself without guarantee to give oneself completely in the hope that our love will produce love in the loved person love is an act of faith and whoever is of little faith is also of little love
6255001 you come to love not by finding the perfect person but by seeing an imperfect person perfectly
6255002 the most powerful symptom of love is a tenderness which becomes at times almost insupportable
6255003 true love begins when nothing is looked for in return
6255004 love is the emblem of eternity it confounds all notion of time effaces all memory of a beginning all fear of an end
6255005 the life and love we create is the life and love we live
6255006 for every beauty there is an eye somewhere to see it for every truth there is an ear somewhere to hear it for every love there is a heart somewhere to receive it
6255007 listening is an attitude of the heart a genuine desire to be with another which both attracts and heals
6255008 being deeply loved by someone gives you strength while loving someone deeply gives you courage
6255009 the most eloquent silence that of two mouths meeting in a kiss
6255010 since love grows within you so beauty grows for love is the beauty of the soul
6255011 true love is eternal infinite and always like itself it is equal and pure without violent demonstrations it is seen with white hairs and is always young in the heart
6255012 we are all born for love it is the principle existence and its only end
6255013 love is the master key that opens the gates of happiness
6255014 love doesnt make the world go round love is what makes the ride worthwhile
6255015 to get the full value of joy you must have someone to divide it with
6255016 if i know what love is it is because of you
6255017 so dear i love him that with him all deaths i could endure without him live no life
6255018 love is like a friendship caught on fire in the beginning a flame very pretty often hot and fierce but still only light and flickering as love grows older our hearts mature and our love becomes as coals deep burning and unquenchable
6255019 how delicious is the winning of a kiss at loves beginning
6255020 one word frees us of all the weight and pain in life that word is love
6255021 there is no remedy for love but to love more
6255022 if i had a flower for every time i thought of you i could walk in my garden forever
6255023 this world is not my home im just a passing through
6255024 when troubles come your way consider it an opportunity for great joy for you know that when your faith is tested your endurance has a chance to grow so let it grow for when your endurance is fully developed you will be perfect and complete needing nothing

6255071 in oaxaca a group of incompetents are playing with fire on a dry prairie
6255072 theres fear intimidation apathy and the sense of defeat for what was lived through in 2006 because there are people that say weve already tried everything and nothing that can be done we know the elections are a fraud we tried direct action and it was of no use so theres a damaging psychological effect without a doubt at the same time an intelligent novel and imperceptible movement is generating
6255073 invisible to the media because there is nothing spectacular it is not defined by marches but the solidifying of initiatives for the generation of a new social fabric
6255074 is that the citizens are not going to let them ruin the environment everyday life and the social fabric in the city
6255075 in oaxaca we are at the point of exploding for any reason without a doubt our challenge is how do we do it peacefully how to channel all this energy and rage in a democratic manner non violently
6255076 what is happening in oaxaca is a mix of criminals drug traffickers and mafioso types that are kidnapping beating and killing
6255077 although its very disorganized the real organized crime is in the government because we are living in a climate of impunity
6255078 all the criminals of all stripes those that are in the government and outside of it know that impunity reigns in oaxaca because they know that nothing will happen
6255079 anything can happen in oaxaca and there will be no consequences in the end one can commit any abuse of any kind and there will be no repercussions
6255080 you dont know how dangerous it is and thats the scary part
6255081 if theres any love in me dont let it grow

6255111 we have set up several special rooms in the airport to look after the families psychologist juan antonio carujo said on cadena ser radio
6255112 they the opposition are the ones that really matter he said to abc radio
6255113 they are the ones that should be looking at what they are doing particularly on budget measures
6255114 and any erosion of that by the liberal party through the senate will ultimately be at their peril
6255115 while we continue to see volatility in international markets and increases in the average cost of long term funding we have experienced some short term funding relief which we are keen to pass on to our customers he said
6255116 while i am pleased to make todays undertaking our medium and long term funding and our retail deposit base represent the greatest proportion of our funding costs and the average cost of these sources of funding continue to increase
6255117 the recent fall in short term funding costs provides an opportunity to undertake to move rates in line with the rba decision but future interest rate decisions will need to reflect an assessment of all the cost of funding factors
6255118 all australian banks are reliant on offshore funding and increases in the average cost of long term funding are likely to be with us for some time
6255119 therefore any consideration that the federal government can give to enhance the attractiveness of retail bank deposits will help reduce overall funding costs and assist in lowering mortgages rates
6255120 clearly we would love to pass through the full 25 basis points drop if that were to occur but well need to factor in all of those issues at that time she told an investor briefing

6255130 at this point its not about a russia that is bent on an imperial conquest
6255131 i think frankly we have been pretty restrained in this
6255132 and i would say beginning with my remarks at the vercunda conference a year ago february where now prime minister putins speech was regarded by virtually everyone there as very aggressive and we have tried not to respond in that manner
6255133 in diplomatic parlance this is not directed against russia it is a part of the ballistic missile defense capability intended to combat small scale missile attack by rogue states mainly iran thats been the aim and policy of the u s and its allies for years
6255134 but in political parlance it is clearly a response to and a rebuff to russian aggressiveness in the caucasus it negates some russian options for intimidation
6255135 we must display a mastery of irregular warfare comparable to that which we possess in conventional combat

6255140 its just terrible theyre very very upset dr lovell said
6255141 hes been like part of the family for a long long time
6255142 i think weve got some good news there i think shes doing quite well he said

6255144 la realidad del deporte mexicano es una constante cada cuatro a os desde hace mucho tiempo

6255147 los muchachos enfrentan el equipo mexicano a pa ses que realmente tienen una infraestructura deportiva mucho mayor que la que tenemos nosotros y programas que son deportivos de fondo de base de primaria secundaria y la masividad es cuando se trabaja
6255148 el siguiente paso es una secretar a una subsecretar a del deporte o un instituto para que en un momento dado tenga m s desarrollo a nivel nacional m s control en la parte deportiva
6255149 hay gente que no tiene perfil que no sabe de administraci n que desgraciadamente en lugar de apoyar en la parte administrativa no aporta y pone obst culos y no permea para poder unir al deporte

6255165 customer safety has always been a priority at eclipse and we look forward to this investigation dispelling any inaccuracies about the certification of this airplane for once and for all
6255166 the question is whether faa did what its supposed to do in certifying this jet
6255167 typically faa managers dont make a move unless you have a cadre of engineers willing to approve a design
6255168 they were telling the pilots to inspect the throttle quadrants but they arent engineers it was like telling them to do something for the sake of it doing it

6255187 the band has evolved into an animal that could slot in right beside
6255188 is like predominantly sung with only a few screams thrown in as accents and while plenty skilled the genre melding in this case leaning heavily on neo classical classic rock as well as a few non heavy outings allows the band to slow down and take it easy while allowing the speedy guitar runs to fly away in the background as support

6255205 namun pada masalah yang relatif mudah seperti ejakulasi prematur banyak ahli terapi yang mendapatkan hasil yang memuaskan bahkan mungkin dapat menangani masalah tersebut dengan tuntas dalam waktu tiga bulan
6255206 jika seorang laki laki memberikan kenikmatan kepada pasangannya dalam waktu yang lama sehingga si wanita mencapai orgasme dan kemudian baru dia sendiri yang mencapai orgasme tidak perduli seberapa cepat lalu apa lagi di mana letak masalahnya terdapat banyak masalah masalah seksual yang sebenarnya bukan masalah berkenaan dengan ejakulasi prematur ini
6255207 karena berbagai alasan laki laki yang mengalami ejakulasi prematur tidak mempunyai indera yang normal terhadap apa yang dirasakan oleh genital mereka ketika mereka sangat terangsang dan ketika hampir berejakulasi
6255208 kelemahan indera inilah yang menjadi penyebab masalahnya dan juga kunci penyembuhan kontrol ejakulasi yang tidak memadai ini
6255209 dari pengalaman klinis kami yang luas telah mengajarkan kepada kami bahwa sangat mustahil untuk menyembuhkan seorang laki laki yang mengalami ejakulasi prematur jika isterinya atau pasangannya tidak dapat diajak bekerja sama

6255238 another and less ideological factor was impacting upon the reading and writing of civil war military history in the 1950s and 1960s
6255239 not a few good civil war historians began to examine the doings of generals and politicians of other wars and crises for possible study others took to repeating themselves by the time the centennial years drew to an end books on the civil war were becoming a glut on the history market
6255240 not only repetition but also outright duplication of topic and approach
6255241 you cant grab your food you cant grab your tv grab what you can and go
6255242 i had no idea what it looked like out there until today

6255247 these interrogations and checkpoints are comparable to police practices in authoritarian regimes and especially apartheid era south africa which is even more ominous given the fact the residents of these new oe red zones are mostly african american and poor
6255248 i am sure the warehouse man knows something and he is one of those who will be investigated

6255258 unanimously passed a motion at its 2007 fall meeting in california that 3 million be held in reserve to assist the state if necessary in the industrys current battle with animal activists concerning a referendum on the november 2008 ballot that would eliminate cage production in california
6255259 agribusiness firms are already spending millions to defeat proposition 2 and they hardly needed an illegal infusion of check off funds authorized by the usda to supplement their political campaign
6255260 expending these funds within 90 days of the election is a transparent attempt to influence the vote on proposition 2 the egg industry and usda had 49 other states in which to spend this money but it chose to do so in california right before the election and thats unethical and illegal
6255261 california egg producers are undertaking a campaign to defeat the measure
6255262 the american egg board voted to set aside 3 million
6255263 industry groups are already gearing up to blitz the public with propaganda advocating that farm animals be confined in tiny cages where they cannot even turn around and extend their limbs
6255264 we dont know if theyve yet used funds from aebs coffers but its in the public interest to put a stop to any unlawful use of federal funds immediately

6255268 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
6255269 the critical problem in the murray darling basin is one that no government can easily fix
6255270 in an age of climate change and during a prolonged drought we simply have less water in the basin
6255271 part of trying to deal with that is the water buyback and the problem with queensland is dealt with by the fact that of the 400 million we have reserved as part of the buyback 350 million is being reserved for queensland
6255272 the nature of the water system is that the further south you go the tougher people tend to be doing it right through until you reach the end of the system in south australia
6255273 so i can absolutely understand the frustration that so many farmers feel and the water that they know would produce a profitable crop in a properly irrigated area simply isnt available on zero allocations

6255279 consistent with conditions in the broader economy advertising markets have slowed in the new financial year the company said
6255280 we have limited visibility on how well advertising markets will perform this half
6255281 overall these are a very satisfactory set of results in the face of declining earnings for our sydney and melbourne metropolitan newspapers in australia and tough trading conditions particularly in new zealand fairfax chief executive david kirk said
6255282 these results highlight the successful implementation of our strategy of diversification of revenue investment in digital earnings growth and constant focus on operational improvement to drive earnings per share growth he said
6255283 only the tail was recognisable there was wreckage scattered all over the place and dead bodies across a wide area a lot of them were children

6255290 when it comes to food the temptation to be greedy comes packaged in our culture as a curious pair of opposites a dessert may be
6255291 farmers organisations have been saying to us since we came into government how can we help stop fruit rotting on the vine
6255292 this is their practical proposal we have responded in a modest way with a pilot program over three years that is a practical piece of action farmers want it we have done it
6255293 kay hulls therefore i presume the national party the national farmers federation appear to be supporting the governments position yet we have mr nelson and mr robb rowing in exactly the reverse direction
6255294 allow horses to multiply unchecked on the range without causing an environmental disaster
6255295 over the past few weeks countless news articles have circulated regarding the blms dilemma of caring for 32 000 warehoused wild horses and the announcement that in addition to halting gathers

6255297 the selectors are comfortable this move will maintain the competitive edge for the australian side and provide a wonderful opportunity for brett geeves to join the australian group for the first time
6255298 we look forward to brett lee rejoining the group as soon as possible
6255299 no no a chaco taco make sure u add the chaco part
6255300 we had what we think a fire that started from a wheel bearing about halfway between cheyenne wyoming and salt lake city
6255301 its a pretty barren area without cell phone coverage the guys tried to put out the fire but couldnt do it so they unhooked the tractor from the trailer
6255302 we have a destroyed trailer with a lot of burnt contents well take the two cars that are already in sonoma and make them into race cars
6255303 to begin with you are devastated because you only know that the person was on the plane you dont know if they are alright if they are among the dead you feel totally powerless said ricardo whose brother in law was among the survivors
6255304 it was very hard to arrive at the scene of the accident we have saved those we could said miguel angel sanchez who was in charge of the fire service operation
6255305 we have set up several special rooms in the airport to look after the families psychologist juan antonio carujo said on cadena ser radio
6255306 but the uncertainty makes the situation all the more stressful
6255307 by definition anything from cook is pretty rare and pretty magical
6255308 there are incredibly few things which is why this auction is so exciting and also because its a boomerang which is such an iconic thing
6255309 there are plenty of cook collectors and i would think some australian institutions would be interested
6255310 we suspect there is a correlation people who were thinking of having a family but were waiting and saving intending to buy a house first have decided its too hard and have decided to rent and have a baby anyway
6255311 its speculative but people have had to save longer for a house
6255312 dr ben cunneen hes been a very valuable employee with us for quite a long time dr lovell said on abc radio
6255313 he was the first person who became infected in this outbreak and hes been very very seriously ill in hospital
6255314 i just spare a thought for them for the last five weeks i guess it is theyve virtually had to maintain a vigil with him against overwhelming odds of any chance of success it is terrible
6255315 its just terrible theyre very very upset dr lovell said
6255316 hes been like part of the family for a long long time
6255317 i think weve got some good news there i think shes doing quite well he said
6255318 to begin with you are devastated because you only know that the person was on the plane you dont know if they are alright if they are among the dead you feel totally powerless said ricardo whose brother in law was among the survivors
6255319 it was very hard to arrive at the scene of the accident we have saved those we could said miguel angel sanchez who was in charge of the fire service operation
6255320 we have set up several special rooms in the airport to look after the families psychologist juan antonio carujo said on cadena ser radio
6255321 what were seeing now is a clear regrouping and also again some kind of deception campaign saying look were moving out
6255322 they are going around now and trying to grab new strategic areas in georgia
6255323 we still believe this is not all that this is just a beginning
6255324 dreaming to turn my country into chechnya into some kind of insurgency warfare field where they go around and operate with brutal force
6255325 the last thing im worried about is about my political future right now
6255326 i think the formal process kicked off with the establishment of a nato georgia commission
6255327 i think its right to see georgian and ukrainian membership as part of a process to build up these countries as a permanent fixture not just as an accident
6255328 an important signal but there is also important substance to it
6255329 in practical terms nato is offering close cooperation with the georgian government and the georgian military
6255330 and announced the setting up of the nato georgia commission
6255331 true stability results when presumed order and presumed disorder are balanced a truly stable system expects the unexpected is prepared to be disrupted waits to be transformed
6255332 found her love for reconstruction design at a early age as her mother was a seamstress
6255333 mother and she still reconstruct the pieces she finds and they look forward to opening a boutique together
6255334 provide products services and information to address a variety of needs and audiences in an ever changing economy
6255335 they the opposition are the ones that really matter he said to abc radio
6255336 they are the ones that should be looking at what they are doing particularly on budget measures
6255337 and any erosion of that by the liberal party through the senate will ultimately be at their peril
6255338 while we continue to see volatility in international markets and increases in the average cost of long term funding we have experienced some short term funding relief which we are keen to pass on to our customers he said
6255339 while i am pleased to make todays undertaking our medium and long term funding and our retail deposit base represent the greatest proportion of our funding costs and the average cost of these sources of funding continue to increase
6255340 the recent fall in short term funding costs provides an opportunity to undertake to move rates in line with the rba decision but future interest rate decisions will need to reflect an assessment of all the cost of funding factors
6255341 all australian banks are reliant on offshore funding and increases in the average cost of long term funding are likely to be with us for some time
6255342 therefore any consideration that the federal government can give to enhance the attractiveness of retail bank deposits will help reduce overall funding costs and assist in lowering mortgages rates
6255343 clearly we would love to pass through the full 25 basis points drop if that were to occur but well need to factor in all of those issues at that time she told an investor briefing
6255344 if lower short term money market rates are sustained and the reserve bank lowers the official cash rate there will be flow onto anzs variable rates an anz spokeswoman said this morning

6255349 reforms will start by a new administration structure and end with a popular contract which will keep the jamahiriyah system in place but with a new form that is different from the bad initial one
6255350 now we want to agree on laws that rule us in the future the era now is different we want a new administrative system law and a constitution for once and all that do not change each time
6255351 we are living in a forest ruled by dictatorships and hereditary regimes that trample human rights all are dictatorships with fictitious parliaments and constitutions
6255352 it should be an example and a model in the

6255362 raw sewage contains potential pathogenic viruses or bacteria that present a wide variety of health issues particularly for children or immune compromise adults it could lead to illness
6255363 its the first round of a general election so the state of washington in a literal sense and historic sense no longer has a primary the parties really cant choose their own nominees anymore
6255364 they best represent the district because theyre the top vote getters
6255365 theres a certain logic that says they ought to be the ones squaring off in november theyll have to campaign through november and be accountable to voters thats healthy for our process
6255366 im not sure where its going to go we dont have any immediate plans to claim harm from what happened yesterday in a legal sense well see how this all pans out

6255369 media in asia a tool for human rights education and monitoring
6255370 the international conference has a purpose of bringing together lectures practitioners and students interested in the academic discourse of complex interconnections between media and human rights at a time when both have become central tenets of political cultural and policy debate
6255371 is to develop in the participants a foundational knowledge on the role of media and the academe in reporting on human rights issues so as to be able to bring this discourse to the classroom
6255372 el municipio no puede seguir jugando con un problema tan caro para todos como es el de la seguridad de nuestros vecinos
6255373 instituto para la observaci n y prevenci n de la inseguridad
6255374 con mucha angustia que el municipio env e comunicados de prensa informando actividades en materia de seguridad como lo refleja la nota publicada por el diario clar n en su suplemento de san isidro del 14 de agosto de 2008 en el cual se anuncia que el observatorio sale a relevar las garitas eso ya fue hecho por el foro sabemos que hay 511 agencias reconocidas y oficializadas y 200 casillas de seguridad privada puestas en forma irregular
6255375 a pesar de nuestro apoyo a cualquier pol tica de refuerzo en seguridad nosotros entendemos que esta es una nueva mentira del intendente gustavo posse tratando de desviar la atenci n y no hacerse cargo de los problemas de seguridad que los vecinos de san isidro tenemos esta ong no tiene raz n de ser en tanto que duplica las funciones que ya cumple el foro de seguridad municipal creado por ley provincial 12 154 98 que agrupa a las ong y vecinos del municipio
6255376 en lugar de poner cortinas de humo lo que deber a hacer el intendente posse es utilizar los m s de 10 millones de pesos que recauda por las tasas que pagan los vecinos al servicio de la seguridad y no usarlos en gastos corrientes

6255518 what may be safe for many may be life threatening for a few
6255519 they should talk to their physicians about this for sure i think thats the most immediate advice talk about other alternatives or whether you need such a high dose or what to do
6255520 if you feel groggy and sedated you have to assume the baby is experiencing the same
6255521 we realize that codeine is very useful for many women the point here is to be much more sensitive and not assume that it is safe

6255523 and now it appears that people taking antidepressants who also have relatively higher depression scores fare significantly worse when attempting to perform a computerised simulation of driving
6255524 and i wouldnt want to instill fear in drivers but i think that perhaps individuals who are taking these medications should just be aware of the fact that they may cause concentration problems and impair reaction time
6255525 this issue is not just a question for drivers because the cognitive skills needed for driving are also needed for a lot of other skills
6255526 this is part of a family that had farmed land here for years
6255527 all of a sudden were instructing someone they have to sell that land and that seems a bit ridiculous to me at this point
6255528 i know they have to have laws in regard to restrictions and i respect that but just in this case this farm is no threat to anyone
6255529 i wanted to keep the family farm for sentimental value my grandfather was an original homesteader in 1909 so the farm has been in the family for 99 years before my mom passed away she wanted the farm to go to my sister and myself and then to the grandchildren
6255530 my grandfather he was not a quitter he showed the saskatchewan spirit to go forward and thats what i sort of want to hang onto
6255531 i think the first thing im going to tell them to start when you make a decision use common sense they have exemptions they can make and in this case should have been i feel personally as a farmer from the past should have been used
6255532 i think common sense tells you this isnt something that threatens our way of life on the family farm
6255533 we dont want to open it up to the point where all of a sudden theres corporations from all over the world owning big blocks of land here as a farmer i think that would hinder my business

6255536 we hebben veel problemen gehad in de voorbereiding ook omdat we als koppel uit elkaar gingen dit waren echt de moeilijkste spelen uit mijn carri re we hadden ons gespecialiseerd in licht weer maar uiteindelijk hebben we weinig licht weer gehad qingdao is ook een slechte locatie mijn afscheid van de spelen had ik me toch anders voorgesteld het zal straks moeilijk worden

6255564 however assuming no further deterioration in economic conditions qantas expects its 2008 09 profit before tax to be broadly in line with analyst consensus forecasts
6255565 the rapid rise in fuel costs since december last year is unprecedented and the impact has been felt across the aviation industry and the world economy
6255566 we have reacted quickly and have already announced a number of steps to reduce costs adjust capacity and increase fares
6255567 regarding the loyalty business qantas is well advanced in its preparations for a partial australian ipo subject to market conditions
6255568 the result included revenue of 850 million primarily from the redemption of qantas frequent flyer points for flight and other awards
6255569 total costs for the period were 721 million with the majority of costs being the purchase of airline seats from qantas group airline businesses

6255575 we expect to convert some of these opportunities to optimise our capital and returns to shareholders
6255576 at current exchange rates we now expect gross written premium to be around 12 5 billion and net earned premium to be around 10 8 billion for 2008

6255586 while we continue to see volatility in international markets and increases in the average cost of long term funding we have experienced some short term funding relief which we are keen to pass on to our customers he said
6255587 while i am pleased to make todays undertaking our medium and long term funding and our retail deposit base represent the greatest proportion of our funding costs and the average cost of these sources of funding continue to increase
6255588 the recent fall in short term funding costs provides an opportunity to undertake to move rates in line with the rba decision but future interest rate decisions will need to reflect an assessment of all the cost of funding factors
6255589 all australian banks are reliant on offshore funding and increases in the average cost of long term funding are likely to be with us for some time
6255590 therefore any consideration that the federal government can give to enhance the attractiveness of retail bank deposits will help reduce overall funding costs and assist in lowering mortgages rates
6255591 clearly we would love to pass through the full 25 basis points drop if that were to occur but well need to factor in all of those issues at that time she told an investor briefing

6255596 we are grateful to zimbabwe cricket for confirming the decision taken by its officials during annual conference week icc president david morgan said in a statement

6255599 if they did id think the penalty would be something pretty hefty
6255600 its on mate its definitely worked well the last couple of years when weve used it
6255601 whether that was the reason we won our games we dont know but we think it helps alcohol is certainly something that doesnt help with our recovery coming into these games where were backing up close together and travelling a lot thats why were doing it again
6255602 the first year it was 2006 the coaching staff they brought it up but said it was entirely up to us whether we wanted to enforce it we thought it was a good idea and weve decided to do it again
6255603 were going to be running into some desperate teams teams that are going to be fighting for their lives i suppose

6255608 barack obamas ad is ridiculous because of john mccain corruption was exposed and people like jack abramoff went to jail
6255609 however if barack obama wants to have a discussion about truly questionable associations lets start with his relationship with the unrepentant terrorist william ayers at whose home obamas political career was reportedly launched
6255610 the question now is will barack obama immediately call on the university of illinois to release all of the records they are currently withholding to shed further light on senator obamas relationship with this unrepentant terrorist
6255611 with this in mind we will focus the business on controlling costs making our operations more efficient and ensuring high quality well managed inventories

6255628 across all the business units there are extensive programs in place to help ensure the momentum of the past 18 months continues into the current year mr mckenzie said
6255629 there is evidence however that global economies are slowing and this could impact the growth in sales
6255630 inflationary pressures are increasing with the impact of higher oil prices flowing through to input costs and higher cost inflation in most countries mr mckenzie said
6255631 the profit after tax of 369 million was a solid result given the negative impact on earnings of the strong australian dollar chief executive ken mckenzie said

6255703 the council of state did approve issuance of the easement so its just a matter of working out the final details to get that document to move forward in the process
6255704 that should happen in the next several days and when the owners receive it it will be on them to record the easement with the craven county register of deeds
6255705 may grant easements for the purpose of cooperating with the federal government utilizing the natural resources of the state or serving the public interest
6255706 the rights and privileges of the citizens to use the waterfront are the same as they always were
6255707 the land is still the property of the people of new bern the sheraton doesnt own it it doesnt own one single foot of it
6255708 this statute that the state is using has nothing to do with riparian rights and nothing to do with settling this thing
6255709 it sends a signal that i can go apply for an easement to the public trust waters sitting in front of the mayors house and then put up a marina there even though i dont own the waterfront land he wouldnt like that because id be encroaching upon his riparian rights
6255710 in this case the soleil group is doing the same thing to the people of new bern

6255716 reporters traveling with obama sensed something might be happening between the pair when they arrived at dulles international airport after an event in northern virginia and obama was not aboard the airplane asked at the time about the illinois senators whereabouts obama spokesman robert gibbs smiled and declined to comment
6255717 why were we not told about this meeting until we were on the plane the doors were shut and the plane was about to taxi to take off
6255718 senator obama had a desire to do some meetings others had a desire to meet with him tonight in a private way and that is what we are doing
6255719 is there more than one meeting is there more than one person with whom he is meeting
6255720 i am not going to get into all the details of the meeting
6255721 there was a desire to do some meetings tonight he was interested in doing them others were interested in doing them and to do them in a way that was private
6255722 called obamas office today to ask if he had attended bilderberg a campaign spokeswoman refused to discuss the matter but would not deny that obama had attended bilderberg

6255726 several people pointed to the secretive and exclusive bilderberg conference of some 120 people that this year drew the likes of henry a kissinger melinda gates and richard a perle to stresa italy in early june as helping edwards win mr kerrys heart mr edwards spoke so well in a debate on american politics with the republican ralph reed that participants broke bilderberg rules to clap before the end of the session
6255727 his performance at bilderberg was important said a friend of mr kerry who was there he reported back directly to kerry there were other reports on his performance whether they reported directly or indirectly i have no doubt the word got back to mr kerry about how well he did

6255741 federal law enforcement officials continued to deliberate on whether and when to release evidence they say implicates a u s military researcher in the 2001 anthrax attacks the intense seven year investigation has also put fort detrick under increased scrutiny the justice departments caution stems in part from early mistakes that caused investigators to focus on another fort detrick scientist steven hatfill mr hatfill sued the government for wrongly targeting him in the case and the doj last month agreed to pay him 5 8 million to settle the case
6255742 over the past week the media was gripped by the news that the fbi was about to charge bruce ivins a leading anthrax expert as the man responsible for the anthrax letter attacks in september october 2001
6255743 the fbi is basing a central part of its case against bruce ivins on anthrax spores found on a laboratory flask to which the scientist has access according to two people briefed on the matter
6255744 my emphasis evan perez siobhan gorman susan schmidt and elizabeth williamson at the
6255745 the fbi says the evidence including hundreds of pages of unsealed documents proves that dr ivins was the sole person responsible for the 2oo1 anthrax mailings he committed suicide on july 29 after federal prosecutors informed him they intended to charge him in the attacks that killed five people and injured 17 u s attorney jeffrey taylor jt said there was no physical evidence that tied the researcher to the mailbox in princeton where the letters were mailed but said authorities reached a reasonable conclusion that it was possible he had done so based on his past actions paul kemp dr ivins attorney accused federal prosecutors of conducting an orchestrated dance of carefully worded statements heaps of innuendo and a staggering lack of real evidence the fbi now faces a major challenge making its version of events stick over the many competing narratives that have arisen in the intervening years and over its own prior mistakes we believe we could have proven dr ivins guilt beyond a reasonable doubt said mr taylor the u s attorney
6255746 it sounds like a very bad made for televison move a mad scientist a violent sociopath a nerd with a dark side who had already tried to kill several people is obsessed with pornography and is fixated on a particular college sorority unleashes a strain of anthrax through the u s mail killing five infecting 17 others and terrorizing the country his motive aside from sheer antisocial vindictiveness he holds the patent for an anthrax vaccine and he also wants to direct the nations attention to the supposedly overlooked and underfunded problem of bio terrorism thatll teach em it sounds like some pretty execrable fiction yet the fbi is peddling this farrago of shopworn cliches as the facts surrounding the alleged guilt of bruce e ivins whose suicide the other day ostensibly closes the 7 year old anthrax terrorism case that has baffled investigators and shown a cruel light on the bureaus methods and standards of conduct the real topper has got to be the sorority obsession this passes muster in hollywood of course since it embodies all the social prejudices so beloved by that temple of cultural corruption yet in the real world one looks at it askance and wonders are these guys kidding clearly the whole purpose of bringing this sorority angle up is to smear a dead man as a pervert and cast him in the sinister light suitable for the villian in this crude media narrative for all the genome tracing and scientific detective work conducted by the fbi over a period of years the reality is that they can trace the anthrax to a particular lab but not as several experts have pointed out to a particular person that would require real detective work of the gumshoe variety as opposed to farming it out to scientists many of whom are or were on the fbis suspect list ivins himself was recruited to this task yet the fbi is not that concerned with the facts what theyre after is a good story one that the media and therefore they think the public will swallow without thinking about it too much they arent trying to convince a jury after all the guy is dead well they didnt arrest him because there wasnt enough evidence so they drove him to suicide as the only alternative to confessing to a crime he didnt commit did they drive ivins to suicide because he knew too much surely a lone nut could not have carried out this technically difficult and logistically complicted scheme
6255747 the anthrax murder case has become an epic embarassment for the fbi and the suicide of ivins on july 29
6255748 paul kemp ivins lawyer said some of whats presented in the unsealed affidavits are speculative theories that would never be admissible in court whats more kemp said the fbi omitted evidence that might have been exculpatory including that ivins kept his security clearance after passing a polygraph in which he was questioned about the anthrax investigation
6255749 prosecutor can get a grand jury to indict a ham sandwich
6255750 could have proven dr ivins guilt beyond a reasonable doubt
6255751 you know my office perry we would never even seek an indictment if we didnt feel we had enough evidence to convict
6255752 i know hamilton but my client will plead not guilty

6255771 weve spent so many resources and so much attention on iraq that weve lost sight of future threats down the road the current conflict between russia and georgia is a perfect example

6255773 we have seen the reports but cannot comment on the matter
6255774 the treaty allows for cooperation in criminal drug trafficking and terrorism related matters

6255776 of course we are concerned about the fans however any disappointment from the core fans should not be directed toward fox what we are doing is seeking to enforce our distribution rights to watchmen legal copyright ownership should not just be swept under the rug and ignored
6255777 i wont make any difference to rupert murdochs bank balance because there are plenty of uninformed sheep out there for his rabidly right wing keeping the populous afraid of their neighbours so theyll vote that way brainwashing agenda for him to fleece of their hard earned tax paying cash

6255780 right through the motivational campaign theme they were doing everything right
6255781 the stature gap between obama and mccain widened dramatically in the mind of any viewer who watched
6255782 the political mind why you cant understand 21st century american politics with an 18th century brain
6255783 the nature of the campaign is changing less than a week before the convention starts
6255784 obama felt he was sitting with dr phil and he was trying not to offend anybody mccain seemed to understand he was running for president his answers were more direct and aimed at the electorate
6255785 the primaries are pre season you can make mistakes but now were into the first game that really counts
6255786 obamas folks are reading their own press clippings too much and theyve got to understand theyre in a dogfight
6255787 the party is very bad at labeling things that provide an umbrella for other positive memories

6255794 i am not willing to change my beliefs to meet you half way but i am willing to worship with you and
6255795 i joined a thinking persons church and will not give that up
6255796 disappointment that our bishops conference recently could not agree on a collegial response to the governments legislation on same sex adoption
6255797 attempting to arrive at a consensus among bishops with sometimes divergent views episcopal conference statements and documents have a tendency to be often flat and safe at a time when we need passionate and courageous public statements that dare to speak the full truth in love
6255798 i must admit that during my 15 years as a bishop i have increasingly come to share certain concerns about the relationship between individual bishops and the national conference
6255799 reluctance among the rest of the bishops to speak out on these issues
6255800 results often in the loss of the scandal and the folly of the gospel so that we are no longer the salt and leaven so urgently needed
6255801 confident courageous and prophetic bishops are vital for the well being of the church during this time of increasingly aggressive secularism
6255802 everyone is great and she is a healthy beautiful baby girl
6255803 i had braces and glasses and a big curly fro
6255804 i wasnt necessarily too active in getting into the social crowd so i definitely understand not fitting in
6255805 even though she doesnt need it anymore its kept her from having to show the world her true self
6255806 its been a very different experience to be on my own

6255810 hes a great player and i hope he helps me a lot in the transition to the nba
6255811 for me that would be perfect filling calderons old role
6255812 ill be a rookie and ill take some time to adapt to the new game and a new team for the first time last year i had a pretty good season and the raptors for the first time they particularly wanted me it wasnt just talk it was really action
6255813 so i decided it was good for me because i had an opportunity to play and not just be part of the team im 23 years old i dont have time to wait any more
6255814 we need ukic to play this year and i think thats what made it enticing for him to come
6255815 you look back at joses first year and it wasnt anything really exciting but he learned the league and thats the most important for ukic learn the nba
6255816 these things need to be considered it has to be a considered approach
6255817 what we would then look at is a situation where were not hydrating and sterilising significant parts of the mine were actually seeking to preserve the asset so we would be able to ramp up at any point in that time if we got a significant change in metal price to a higher level of production
6255818 like i said to the boys six years ago at the end of pasminco i thought it couldnt get any worse
6255819 then perilya comes along and were six years later 400 people are going again
6255820 a lot of these lads young fellas a lot of them come here and work for perilya that never worked in the industry before come out from pushing trolleys at woolworths and theyve grown up and theyve learnt the mine trade
6255821 he got it wrong and hes underestimated how let down key forum leaders are feeling very let down

6255826 once a kata has been learned then the kata needs to be forgotten that is at some point in studying karate typically the black belt level the time comes to transcend the motions and seek meaning in the kata the student discovers how his her view of the world is reflected in their performance of kata and if lucky they learn how to adapt the kata to new interpretations as a student learns to do this kata becomes more and more a part of their kumite sparring the skill of self discovery becomes part of their daily life the study of koan is often used to promote this learning
6255827 good judgement comes from experience experience comes frm bad judgement
6255828 often the true value of a thing isnt the thing itself but instead is the activity that created it
6255829 and a good mechanic cant find any fault in his tools
6255830 as you would expect we have been in communication with the companies for months to receive updates and weve been communicating with their regulator and the federal reserve
6255831 we continue to be concerned about what dilution would be required to stabilize fannie and freddie and what that would leave over for existing shareholders
6255832 the investigation has already begun to uncover some disturbing facts that seem to belie the innocent picture of downstream brokerages you paint in your letter
6255833 for example some evidence indicates that fidelity was actively marketing auction rate securities to its high net worth clients
6255834 even if universal is correct that fair use only excuses infringement the fact remains that fair use is a lawful use of a copyright
6255835 accordingly in order for a copyright owner to proceed under the dmca with a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner its agent or the law the owner must evaluate whether the material makes fair use of the copyright
6255836 allegation that a copyright owner acted in bad faith by issuing a takedown notice without proper consideration of the fair use doctrine thus is sufficient to state a misrepresentation claim
6255837 while these concerns are understandable their actual impact likely is overstated although there may be cases in which such considerations will arise there are likely to be few in which a copyright owners determination that a particular use is not fair use will meet the requisite standard of subjective bad faith required to prevail in an action for misrepresentation
6255838 considerable doubt that lenz will be able to prove that universal acted with subjective bad faith
6255839 while the court merely declined to throw the case out at this early pleadings stage
6255840 we remain confident that we will prevail in this matter
6255841 by far this is our most extreme dramatic and deeply disturbing album to date the legend of gilles de rais has been given fresh vampyrical life in this conceptual meisterwerk swathed in pitch black magic and a viciousness unsurpassed in the annals of cradle history screw what our detractors say everyone who has heard this album has bruised their jaws on the pentagram bejewelled floor
6255842 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
6255843 it expresses a longing an underlying sadness for something or someone thats been missing in your life and never quite sure if it will ever return in this case for us its rock and roll saudades de rock

6255860 were likely to get a much grimmer view of the construction industry than persimmon warned us about just a month ago
6255861 this comes against the background of the uks biggest mortgage lender halifax telling us that the value of our homes has slumped by more than 10 over the last year
6255862 thats ok for us to go out and fly but we dont know what its like over there on the fire
6255863 the visibility and the ceiling can change within five minutes
6255864 it could be a good or a bad thing with the wind blowing a little
6255865 except its grounded the aircraft but well take the water from the sky as opposed to from the aircraft and see where it goes
6255866 so the crews are able to get right in next to it
6255867 what we call one foot in the black so theyre able to build line right next to the fire
6255868 wed love to be in compliance but we do the best we can with what weve got

6255872 the assumption that you can hop on the sharia express and just ride a couple of stops is one almighty leap of faith
6255873 early in the game they made a lot of tough shots
6255874 we were doing what we were supposed to be doing and they made tough shots but sooner or later well impose our will i dont know if you can keep up with us for 40 minutes
6255875 i think theyre going to be very very very tough to beat
6255876 theyve been the most difficult team for us to defend
6255877 theyre a force to be reckoned with they caused us a lot of problems
6255878 in the third quarter we said the first three or four minutes we need to pick it up a little bit defensively and make the extra pass offensively
6255879 could you kindly rephrase that in equivocal inaccurate vague self serving and roundabout terms that we can all understand
6255880 so do our troops hate the troops no of course not our troops love america and thats the point

6255898 in this particular case the rule violation was serious and was attempting to interfere with our ability to conduct an accurate post race competitive analysis
6255899 it called for a serious reaction on our part and we think the penalty speaks to that
6255900 in 17 years we have never had any representative of joe gibbs racing knowingly act outside of nascars rules and that is something we consider essential to how we operate on a daily basis
6255901 what we have determined is that these individuals involved used extremely poor judgment
6255902 i would like to apologize to the employees and partners of joe gibbs racing
6255903 because of poor decision making i have failed you as the leader of this team and i am solely responsible for this situation secondly i apologize to the men and women of nascar for my dishonesty and interference during a testing event
6255904 i accept the penalties imposed by nascar and joe gibbs racing and make no excuses
6255905 a poor decision was made by some key members of our organization
6255906 the children delivered via gestational surrogacy are healthy and already under rickys full time care
6255907 ricky is elated to begin this new chapter in his life as a parent and will be spending the remainder of the year out of the public spotlight in order to spend time with his children
6255908 i think that sexuality is something that each individual should deal with in their own way
6255909 i guess these rumors were spread by people who want me to be like them and im not
6255910 i am a modern man live a full life do not feel any barriers inside myself
6255911 i perceive the contemporary world as an open forum where nothing is taboo except criminal activity if i were gay why not admit it i am a normal man i love women and sex i am a real hot blooded puerto rican but have never been attracted by sex with a man
6255912 when im dating i always need to know that the woman is open to being a mother because you meet some women who say who me a mother no because of my figure and thats such a turn off for me
6255913 what are you going to do i dont have a problem with homosexuality im gay friendly im not gay
6255914 i sell records i sell concert tickets but i dont sell the key to my room i have to think of the other person and that persons family its all yeah thats the mother of the girl ricky was naked in the boat with
6255915 it is really important to me to be able to plan to be a father who is there recently the idea of becoming a dad is more and more real to me
6255916 i often sit back and picture myself trekking across asia with two kids and a backpack i want to be with them as they experience things in the world around them
6255917 i can be quite shy and im terrible at chatting up women
6255918 i think its because i have to be so loud and be the boss in my working life that when im not working i want someone else to take the lead
6255919 the family room is already in place its simple all white with wooden tables
6255920 were hoping we can get this thing squared away real quickly
6255921 steven is one of the best players in the nfl and wed like to have him back
6255922 i would approach it the same way if he was here
6255923 im trying to compete and get better every day competition pushes us all and you cant look too far ahead if you do you might not be here
6255924 i just blew my mind and blew the worlds mind
6255925 ive been dreaming of this since i was yea high
6255926 so it means a lot more to me actually than the 100 means
6255927 hes just blessed with an uncanny frame an uncanny quickness a huge competitive heart and he is having a good time which i think our sport sorely needs to see
6255928 he got an incredible start guys of 6 5 should not be able to start like that its that long massive stride hes eating up so much more track than others he came in focused knowing he would likely win the gold and hes got the record
6255929 youre back there giving it everything youve got its brutal
6255930 hes doing it and making it look so simple michael johnson did it and it didnt look that easy
6255931 im on the track hes in the water we cant compare too much hes the best in what he do
6255932 as he gets older physically more mature he can only get faster
6255933 we wanted to find ways to occupy convicts free time
6255934 this contest gives prisoners an opportunity to feel like women to dress up put on makeup and imagine theyre connected to russias new freedom
6255935 i told them to forgive each other help each other and strive to get home what else could i say
6255936 friends we have to have nuclear power nuclear power has got to be part of our way of being energy independent
6255937 yesterday sen obama got a little testy on this issue
6255938 he said i was questioning his patriotism let me be very clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgement
6255939 we value and cherish our hispanic heritage but we also understand we have to secure borders and we have to do it because it is a national security responsibility
6255940 its nice to be with the rest of the sportsmen of the world said
6255941 i have enjoyed talking to so many people from different sports that you dont know much about there is lots of respect going both ways
6255942 im having a blast in the athletes village ive gotten to know the german handball team and the mens and womens field hockey teams and our table tennis and track athletes
6255943 its such a more interesting experience than staying in a hotel
6255944 it sure beats our experience in athens when we were docked on a ship
6255945 weve mingled weve been sightseeing weve attended a bunch of other events we really feel a part of something bigger here
6255946 were hopeful to wrap up some loose ends and some pretrial interviews by the end of this week and then begin the process of submitting case documents to the district attorneys office for review
6255947 were charged with the public trust and we want to maintain the integrity of this investigation and present the facts to the district attorney so they can make the decisions they need to make
6255948 we have got some injuries in the back end and we are looking for someone with cfl experience
6255949 he was saskatchewans starting field corner in the playoffs and grey cup game last year he is a proven commodity
6255950 they werent going to pay three starters for two cornerback positions
6255951 they said it was going to be a competition and it was never a competition
6255952 i had to go from indiana to arizona that is where all my things are
6255953 our hope is we are going to exceed the nfl crowd in toronto
6255954 the way we are tracking we certainly think 50 000 tickets sold is achievable that would be outstanding
6255955 we know with saskatchewan playing the way they are they are the leading draw in the cfl
6255956 but also in there we are playing very good football and we are coming off a bye week we only have the one game at home in august
6255957 i think there is a thirst there from our fans they havent seen us in a while there is pent up demand to see football
6255958 its something that this team certainly didnt have early in the year
6255959 going into spring training watching this team i thought this team would hit a lot of home runs
6255960 i thought that this team the last two years looked like my 93 team we scored a lot of runs that year thats what i thought this team was going to be like
6255961 on the one hand i guess i understand why people make a big deal out of it
6255962 but for golfers its really not a big thing its the rule and its just what you are supposed to do golfers learn that early on in a case like this if you dont call a penalty on yourself youre really cheating the rest of the field
6255963 its kind of why golf is like life in general
6255964 you are expected to do or should do the right thing
6255965 these are legitimate questions and we are aware of the concerns
6255966 the age question is one thing residency can be difficult to prove where is somebodys real permanent residence that can get tough
6255967 we began the dynamic testing of the pipeline wednesday this is a test that needs to be done before full operation
6255968 arena features smaller maps that play out in shorter periods of time the round ends once one team has no players left in the arena or when the central capture point has unlocked and been captured rounds tend to be very fast and highly competitive with an emphasis on your teams class makeup and your plan to counter the opposing teams class choices arena mode is great for smaller matches of three vs three players while still comfortably supporting huge knockdown twelve on twelve brawls
6255969 tv will fundamentally change how we talk about imagine and experience the internet
6255970 this effort is one of what we believe will be many exciting new ways to bring the internet to the tv and it really shows the potential of what consumers can look forward to
6255971 would no longer be a passive experience unless the viewer wants it that way
6255972 we plan to transform traditional tv into something bigger better and more exciting than ever before

6255990 in recent weeks ricky martin became a proud father by the birth of twin sons
6255991 gavin newsom is the most interesting and intelligent new face in california politics since i moved here in 1991 and maybe in the last three decades
6255992 he is bold and fearless and does big things im delighted to bring my gubernatorial campaign experience to his race for governor
6255993 just looking at that dalek made me quake the way the dome shone like the carapace of some black creeping thing id more usually find under one of my rocks but there is nothing remotely natural about a dalek every part of it is sharp dangerous from its metal body to the metallic tearing of its voice
6255994 he doesnt miss a stride as he reaches out a hand touching my arm in his tired eyes i see the hint of a smile his hand moves down my arm and he briefly touches my hand and right then i know that he is what i need i want to cry but i wont i see the difference between a dalek lenss cold glare and the sheer humanity of one look from karl thats why hes here isnt it thats why i will always need him here he is my conscience
6255995 yes the daleks are advancing but theyre still light years away theyre not really a threat not to us here and who cares if a few colonists live in fear or die in fire provided the central union area is safe and protected what would you rather we spent our taxes on protecting some tiny unsustainable world so far away youve never even heard of it or healthcare for the sick and education for the children which one will win the votes at the next election do you think
6255996 ive been a soldier all my days and i know peace is a fantasy conflict is part of our nature and well never truly be free of it no what i want is to know that this war my war is over
6255997 i wont vote for obama but im not sure what ill do
6255998 he was just waking up to the thought that women around the country were upset over the treatment of hillary
6255999 ive never seen someone with a greater work ethic than denise never and her attention to detail is legendary you can see it in every job she touches shes truly brilliant at what she does and hm amp p wouldnt be what it is today with out her
6256000 to top it off she bakes ham biscuits thatll make your eyes roll back in your head
6256001 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
6256002 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything
6256003 i think there is still a lot of fear in the market in terms of the financial sector
6256004 ive never seen anything like this in my career for software
6256005 we reached an agreement final decision with respect to moving ahead has not been made yet but we have an agreement with the umpires
6256006 were going to move forward with the understanding the sides will come to the table later and iron out some of the remaining issues
6256007 going into the day some reasonably good earnings gave us a positive bias and also it seems to me that the commodity stocks which have been pretty beaten up are having a very strong rebound
6256008 but this may be just bargain hunting as i havent seen any economic numbers that would be driving this
6256009 until the fannie and freddie issue gets resolved youll continue to have that uncertainty and it will be hard for the market to make any progress in that alibris 3 99
6256010 confidence that we can meet our insurance profit target for 2008 of around 20 per cent of net earned premium
6256011 the acquisitions converted to date have enabled us to use a portion of our excess capital
6256012 we are experiencing increased acquisition activity with opportunities being presented in many of the markets in which we operate
6256013 we expect to convert some of these opportunities to optimise our capital and returns to shareholders
6256014 at current exchange rates we now expect gross written premium to be around 12 5 billion and net earned premium to be around 10 8 billion for 2008
6256015 although fuel prices have eased over the past month they have not declined to levels that will sustain the current level of profitability and fuel and economic conditions continue to be uncertain
6256016 however assuming no further deterioration in economic conditions qantas expects its 2008 09 profit before tax to be broadly in line with analyst consensus forecasts
6256017 the rapid rise in fuel costs since december last year is unprecedented and the impact has been felt across the aviation industry and the world economy
6256018 we have reacted quickly and have already announced a number of steps to reduce costs adjust capacity and increase fares
6256019 regarding the loyalty business qantas is well advanced in its preparations for a partial australian ipo subject to market conditions
6256020 the result included revenue of 850 million primarily from the redemption of qantas frequent flyer points for flight and other awards
6256021 total costs for the period were 721 million with the majority of costs being the purchase of airline seats from qantas group airline businesses
6256022 we understand the level of scrutiny we are being subjected to at present
6256023 we will work through these issues and implement any changes that may be required but our commitment to safety should never be questioned
6256024 i need to make sure and eat the maximum number of points each day to get the full value because darn it i deserve every single one of those points
6256025 oh i tried so hard and it just doesnt work for me
6256026 no matter how much i suffer i still cant lose this weight
6256027 going into the day some reasonably good earnings gave us a positive bias and also it seems to me that the commodity stocks which have been pretty beaten up are having a very strong rebound
6256028 but this may be just bargain hunting as i havent seen any economic numbers that would be driving this

6256038 thank you very much and have a nice day ps im sorry there will never be a tommy tuberville wannabe
6256039 if theyre only testing for a third of the list of banned steroids it does raise one question whats the point
6256040 i think its too early to talk to the uil about whether we need to make any changes to the program
6256041 well look at all the factors including if we need to test more students well also consider changes to the panel of steroids that are tested
6256042 casting a broader net over more students would probably take some precedence over
6256043 we wanted to make sure that we entered into this the right way to send the right message to our athletes
6256044 if high school kids were smart and knew how to use the internet this kind of testing would prove to be pretty weak
6256045 most know ahead of time that only championship teams are tested and none of them have what i would consider a solid program
6256046 they can then choose a testing panel which is in the best interests of their program
6256047 i personally feel that our staff are very safe because we have instituted multiple layers of safety
6256048 kami siasat kes ini berkaitan persetubuhan haram mengikut seksyen 23 enakmen jenayah syariah johor 2003 iaitu jika sabit kesalahan boleh didenda rm5 000 atau penjara tiga tahun

6256050 we are a small rural district in the bible belt with strong christian beliefs and feel like homosexuality is wrong
6256051 i dont think we are that different from a lot of districts at least in the panhandle that have beliefs that maybe are different from societal changes
6256052 davis embarked on what can only be characterized as a witch hunt to identify students who were homosexual and their supporters further adding fuel to the fire
6256053 he went so far as to lift the shirts of female students to insure the letters gp or the words gay pride were not written on their bodies
6256054 i just felt like i had to stand up for the kids heather wanted to do this and i had to back her
6256055 ideally it would be nice to go into the ninth inning with a five or six run lead were going to try to score as many as we can

6256061 obamas support among voters between the ages of 18 and 29 which had been one of his strengths slipped 12 percentage points to 52 percent mccain who will turn 72 next week was winning 40 percent of younger voters
6256062 the dip in support for obama who would be the first black u s president cut across demographic and ideological lines he slipped among catholics born again christians women independents and younger voters
6256063 glenn really is that good a player and i can understand why celtic and rangers wanted him so much
6256064 it was just his composure that stood out hes like boumsong when he was at rangers when the ball comes up hell bring it on his chest and pass it he never panics and hes a mixture of maybe boumsong and kyrgiakos
6256065 ive sat on it this long ive waited my heart is set on coming over here

6256070 i knew the teams that liked me my agent did a great job telling me who was interested
6256071 so i knew san diego liked me a lot but we didnt think wed be there at that pick
6256072 when they traded up it was unreal they gave up a lot to get me
6256073 while we continue to see volatility in international markets and increases in the average cost of long term funding we have experienced some short term funding relief which we are keen to pass on to our customers he said
6256074 while i am pleased to make todays undertaking our medium and long term funding and our retail deposit base represent the greatest proportion of our funding costs and the average cost of these sources of funding continue to increase
6256075 the recent fall in short term funding costs provides an opportunity to undertake to move rates in line with the rba decision but future interest rate decisions will need to reflect an assessment of all the cost of funding factors
6256076 all australian banks are reliant on offshore funding and increases in the average cost of long term funding are likely to be with us for some time
6256077 therefore any consideration that the federal government can give to enhance the attractiveness of retail bank deposits will help reduce overall funding costs and assist in lowering mortgages rates
6256078 clearly we would love to pass through the full 25 basis points drop if that were to occur but well need to factor in all of those issues at that time she told an investor briefing

6256086 its like a moat theres water all the way around
6256087 you cant tell whats a canal and whats a roadway out here its that bad
6256088 i didnt think it was going to be that deep
6256089 it pretty much came up to my ears and chin
6256090 theyre probably areas of the state that found the rains very beneficial
6256091 its something i would not be able to tell you at this point
6256092 i would like to think that the member boards would not send weakened sides because no life is lesser than another
6256093 the centre of our inquiry and has to be proven in court
6256094 whoever got picked to be captain would have deserved it because rio has had a great season and has been a great servant for manchester united and england and john terry has also had a great season
6256095 any one of those two could have been captain and not forgetting steven gerrard there are great leaders and captains throughout our team so we are lucky with that
6256096 we all congratulated jt and rio did so at the end of the day we all stick together and we all believe in our captain
6256097 we had the chance of replying to the offers of other clubs like manchester city but he as well as me said no
6256098 people were perhaps expecting djibril to move to a prestigious team and sunderland without being among the great english clubs are part of a league where clubs have all the economic power and sporting importance
6256099 with sunderland it isnt an impulsive thing but as he came to the end of this transfer window he wanted to leave and showed a massive desire to play
6256100 it is that more than his divorce from om that is in his mind at the moment
6256101 it is a chance for him to get his life back in order as far as his career and as far as the france team is concerned
6256102 everyone knows that his absence from the euros mortified him
6256103 michael probably wont be fit and mark viduka certainly wont be
6256104 i probably could rush michael back and then knock him back five or six weeks
6256105 i walked into this place for the first time on a wet july morning in 2005 and thought yes this is it
6256106 everywhere you look its a feast for the eye and of course thats a feast for the soul
6256107 its quiet and its beautiful with no internet noises or computer beeps or traffic jams the best possible departure for making music and listening to music
6256108 it was extremely nice we bumped into lots of people it was a night of coincidences
6256109 what you are hearing is the finest musicians playing at the top of their form but also for their own pleasure
6256110 we shouldnt have sent these young men to go and get killed
6256111 whats certain is that they died in an ambush like game animals
6256112 but there also has to be a time for reflection on the sense of our presence in afghanistan
6256113 the priority should first be reconstruction rebuilding afghanistan and above all training the afghan army
6256114 mi objetivo es el r cord de espa a y la final
6256115 we rethought those plans and came up with a way to put a lid on the cells instead of the razor wire
6256116 the important thing is this has to function as a normal jail
6256117 the nature of jail is to create an environment where you can maintain security and order and one of our primary charges is the care and custody of inmates
6256118 james and kenny are both excellent strikers and they worked their socks off but a partnership is not something that happens overnight
6256119 we wanted to win the game and we didnt but it wasnt for the want of trying
6256120 we were lacking a cutting edge when you put teams under pressure you need to put the ball into the net overall i thought the team worked very well
6256121 we have a strong squad but a young squad and mikaels versatility experience and calibre will provide the extra depth we need to reinforce our challenge for honours this season
6256122 his defensive adaptability will serve us well and its a big plus that mikael has top level experience and a great understanding of football in the premier league
6256123 ive spent a large part of my career at united the last nine years and ill remember that time fondly but feel im ready for a new challenge
6256124 arsenal is known for playing technical and skilful football and has a young but experienced squad
6256125 shevchenko in the rossoneri shirt there really isnt much more to be done
6256126 we are close to the end of the deal and i hope that these little things that have to be fulfilled are done as soon as possible
6256127 i think this night we took another step im happy i saw things i have doubts about
6256128 im happy with the draw because the reaction of the team to the last minute was important and good
6256129 i think also in the first half we played good football with style we created a lot of chances to score goals and the team played together better with different style
6256130 only one thing i didnt like in the first half sometimes when the czechs countered we suffered this is a problem and we have to do something about the problem
6256131 in the second half we lost the style and position and the czechs are a very good team
6256132 i asked to play against them for this reason to see where the problems are
6256133 its a cookbook in aid of the childrens wish foundation of canada put together by our volunteers in lanse au loup the cookbook is just 5 00 available at our office and includes many great recipes the cost of postage and handling is 10 00 if you would like one mailed to you the cookbook is in memory of paula normore who passed away after a snowmobile accident at age 14
6256134 neither mhi or nyk has issued a notice but i would not deny the order
6256135 the sessions have worked extremely well and have enabled competitors to train in a realistic environment with the same equipment they will have onboard their yachts during the race
6256136 the skills they have gained may prove critical should anything go wrong during the race
6256137 yo hace mucho tiempo que he se alado que el candidato de la concertaci n deber a elegirse en una primaria porque dada la fragilidad que tiene hoy nuestra coalici n necesita un candidato potente y necesita un candidato con mucho respaldo en la base y qui n es la base la gente que vota
6256138 y esto no lo estoy diciendo ahora lo estoy diciendo desde el a o 93 hicimos la primera primaria con m s de quinientas mil personas no una primaria chiquitita sino que una gran primaria
6256139 hemos dicho que si el partido tiene que definir que lo defina en una gran votaci n porque hoy d a los partidos cada d a se achican m s las juntas grupitos o sea en vez de expandir la pol tica en vez de abrirla a los ciudadanos todos estamos con junta nacional consejo nacional en cada partido tiene un nombre pero siempre son un grupito el comit central ochenta cien personas ojal sean los menos posibles para que seamos poquitos los que participamos en las decisiones no pues si la democracia es al rev s la democracia es abrirse
6256140 lo hemos visto ahora con la primaria de estados unidos qu ejemplo de democracia nos han dado un terrible ejemplo de democracia cu nto dur la primaria varios meses y con foros todos los d as y toda la gente discutiendo y participando participaron m s de sesenta millones de personas eso es democracia
6256141 esto va unido a que siempre en las campa as se ofrecen todas estas cosas pero al final cuando se vota no se cumple
6256142 y por eso tambi n la desconfianza de la gente y c mo se recupera c mo se reconcursa yendo a las bases yendo a los votantes yendo a los ciudadanos escuchando a los ciudadanos y que los ciudadanos participen y que ellos decidan que estas no sean cositas de grupos o cupulares y ese es el gran cambio que tiene que haber en la pol tica
6256143 va a depender tambi n de c mo se desarrollen los acontecimientos porque si algo hay que hacer en este pa s para el futuro requiere tomar decisiones y armar los equipos para tomar decisiones no hacer m s de lo mismo requiere tener una visi n de futuro por eso siempre me he opuesto a la discusi n del candidato porque qu vamos a proponerle al pa s cu les son los temas que vamos a asumir a partir de a o 2010
6256144 bueno yo entend a que lo que se hab a dicho era que de los temas presidenciales bamos a hablar despu s de las municipales y que el pr ximo a o en fin bamos a hablar del tema de las primarias y tantas cosas que se han dicho se cambi eso y se parti altiro
6256145 yo mantengo la tesis que he mantenido siempre desde comienzos del a o pasado primero las elecciones de alcaldes y concejales que es lo que importa en este momento y que es lo que le importa a los ciudadanos
6256146 el municipio tiene muchas responsabilidades hoy d a de lo que haga bien o mal un municipio mejora mucho la calidad de vida en las comunas y por lo tanto hagamos las cosas como corresponde las municipales y veamos el resultado al cual no hay que sacarle conclusiones f ciles porque muchas veces hay comunas en que la concertaci n por ejemplo en la presidencial saca el 60 o el 65 por ciento de los votos y despu s en la municipal gana un candidato de la alianza o al rev s
6256147 hay que hacer las cosas como corresponde hagamos bien la campa a municipal tengamos un buen resultado si no tenemos un buen resultado en la municipal algunos que hablan de los mejores derechos o que se sigue hasta el final esas cosas pueden quedar en el camino as que tranquilidad en las filas sigamos recorriendo el pa s
6256148 es leg timo que cada parlamentario luche por su regi n porque los proyectos generalmente son dise ados concebidos y pensados en funci n de santiago y no de las regiones y eso lo encontramos en la mayor a de los proyectos de ley
6256149 yo saqu las cuentas y si multiplico por los tres a os que dura este subsidio me da 2070 millones de d lares eso es lo que estamos aprobando en el congreso eso entonces no debe ser motivo de un an lisis a fondo no debe ser motivo de una revisi n
6256150 hay un cr dito del bid que todav a no sabemos qui n lo pagar a qu tasas fue se va a pagar en 16 a os en 16 a os se va a pagar dos tres veces el valor y despu s esto asegura que el sistema va a funcionar bien esto asegura que vamos a tener el control de flota que hasta el d a de hoy no lo tenemos
6256151 theres no new information gathering just a new way of using it
6256152 our government is not supposed to collect information on the innocent activities and movements of its citizens just in case they later commit a crime
6256153 this program illustrates why america needs more robust and across the board privacy laws
6256154 the real benefit has been for analyzing patterns for law enforcement purposes
6256155 were very supportive of paying royalties but this structure is wrong unfair and unaffordable
6256156 it doesnt look to us like the industry that dying
6256157 you cant just look at the percentage of revenue quote and think that tells whole story
6256158 es una tema que sale en todos los consejos por eso para garantizar las condiciones de seguridad es necesario identificar esos sitios para que las autoridades act en
6256159 ya est terminando un censo de habitantes de calle permitir saber el n mero exacto de personas que viven en la indigencia y donde est n ubicados
6256160 ese es un trabajo integral en el que estamos hace ya varios meses en los pr ximos d as tendremos ese censo y de all partir n varias soluciones
6256161 sabemos que este es un sector que envenena a bogot
6256162 this is really palm saying were ready to offer industrial design thats competitive with what were seeing from other companies
6256163 i knew straight away hed swallowed the golf ball but poor louis didnt he was running around in circles trying to find it
6256164 some velvet morning when im straight im gonna open up your gate
6256165 getting married and having children is a very personal matter
6256166 the investigation has already begun to uncover some disturbing facts that seem to belie the innocent picture of downstream brokerages you paint in your letter
6256167 for example some evidence indicates that fidelity was actively marketing auction rate securities to its high net worth clients
6256168 fidelity does not actively market these securities and does not offer special financial incentives to representatives if they sell these securities
6256169 deliberately stuck their heads in the sand but continued to actively market these products to unknowing investors that will certainly be relevant to our calculus of the firms culpability
6256170 take full appropriate measures against any firms or individuals who have violated securities laws and we fully support them in their efforts
6256171 questions were asked of us in the final stages of that game did we have the hunger for it and the answer was yes we have but obviously wed like to show more composure to avoid putting ourselves in that situation again
6256172 with the injury and the result it would have to be more disappointing that anything before
6256173 i felt it during the week i thought it would be okay you dont really know the first ball i went for i turned and i felt the pain run right through it
6256174 south east asia has plummeted to levels it took europe 150 years to reach in just 30 years
6256175 the span of fertility across countries has never been wider
6256176 both extremes cause their own problems if europe continues at 1 5 the population will halve every 65 years if africa continues with half its population under 15 it will continue to consume more than it produces making it harder to escape from poverty and illiteracy
6256177 if i were a gambler i would take even money that england will not exist in the year 2000
6256178 people are very bad at calculating survival probabilities twenty years ago fertility started to decline in nepal and bangladesh when they were still poor korea wasnt rich when fertility declined by contrast the gulf oil states continued with high birthrates long after they got huge wealth
6256179 theres been an extraordinary change in 20 years and it comes from a combination of factors
6256180 they have had 5 to 6 per cent economic growth over the past 15 years and in areas like the textile industry that provides work for lots of ordinary people a woman can earn 25 30 a month in a garment factory thats big money and if you have two daughters working it is delaying the age at which women marry it used to be 14 or 15 now its 21 or 22 another factor is the success of ngos non governmental organisations 20 million households in bangladesh have access to micro finance and in half of them the money goes to the women then there has been education for girls encouraged by programmes that gave cereals to families whose girls went to secondary school and cash for education female stipends
6256181 in africa most women work in agriculture around the home
6256182 but in bangladesh women get out and meet other women at work who may be using contraception getting outside the home fixes a new social norm prosperity and fertility are interlinked in a chicken and egg way
6256183 food sex and procreation are core elements of humanity and changes to them are often met with fierce hostility
6256184 in my view the evidence is that there is something intrinsic to the culture its there in the rich muslim states in the gulf in saudi arabia and in the muslim provinces of the former soviet union it is perhaps bound up with the status of women
6256185 not just in catholic spain and italy but in orthodox greece the strong traditions are not boosting fertility rate as many might suppose
6256186 many women in the developed world will become overloaded and respond by cutting down the number of children they have
6256187 jimmy buffett the boat salesman who had to travel a lot for work
6256188 to pay lay people albeit briefly trained as stop smoking counsellors for spending a few sessions with smokers is an astonishing way to spend public money
6256189 this was all driven by the need to meet targets and it is a feature of the target driven culture of the governments of this country that it can lead to the distortion of proper functions and can lead as in this case to the opportunity for fraud
6256190 i have been a successful businessman in my life i have had the porsche the gold rolex watch and a home in chelsea now all i want to do is help the community
6256191 i know the jury and i and anyone else listening to this case would have been appalled at the cavalier way in which the taxpayers money was dealt with by the kensington and chelsea primary care trust
6256192 the fraud was allowed to continue with the result a large sum of public money designated for health care was lost
6256193 hes applied for unemployment but that wont start until next week theyre going to turn our lights off if we dont pay the 150 we owe i was wondering if your church could help us
6256194 im sorry we have limited funds and we can only help folks in our community
6256195 we have our rules we have limited funds we cant help everybody
6256196 every tom dick and harry it seemed was having retrospectives by the time they were 36 years old
6256197 it seemed negligent of australia to have such an extraordinary talent nationally acclaimed and no one was going to do a retrospective
6256198 it occurred to me here was this elderly pre eminent artist nobody it seemed was going to give her a retrospective before she died
6256199 and more than that there were dealer rivalries she may pass away before the show and the copyright issues would be fraught i had to be courageous and expect things to go wrong if they had it could have been the end of my career it was all so potentially volatile at the time
6256200 one eye on the opening of the national gallery in canberra
6256201 we didnt realise how early we were in all this
6256202 by the time i got to the art gallery of nsw in 1994 i was saying there was no doubt the value of aboriginal art would surpass the value of other australian art the boyds and the nolans and people said i was being stupid but i could see it could only grow
6256203 and not cut a single corner i couldnt afford to have anyone pissed off i was forced quite a few times to swallow my pride and be courteous to people who i felt were exploitative of emily my mantra was to get the best emilys wherever they were for her sake no matter who had them
6256204 i really wanted her to know it was happening and to have her imprimatur
6256205 she was very pleased and wanted to do a last painting for the show even though she was too frail to do anything really big
6256206 yet another person from down south wanting another piece of emily
6256207 he has a liberated mind a poetic heart and fire in his belly
6256208 he instantly fell in love with emilys work and because he loved the selection and the way the exhibition was designed he was determined to get me to bring a show to japan
6256209 listen mate for all sorts of reasons i just cant
6256210 i was firm in saying this is a partnership we have to meet halfway lets not start off with positions like thats not the way we usually do it because neither side had ever done an australia japan blockbuster so we all had to work differently
6256211 what have i done there was half a kilometre of pristine white walls alongside which i was instantly dwarfed i thought had emily done enough top shelf work to fill this 2000sq m space and then i thought well at least i wont have to cut back on what i want to show but then as i went on the journey again to find her works i uncovered many more and in the end had too many again
6256212 everyones talking about her now in terms that have released her from the local to the global so the discussion doesnt have to be bound by political correctness about aboriginality though these are critical issues as well
6256213 what would be sensible now is for gallery directors to go internationally and say youve seen emily so you know what weve got in australia
6256214 theres a lot of risk aversion in the art world
6256215 im approaching this the same way as youd approach any small business venture with an awareness of the risks and a budget and a strategy once all thats in place and you think you can make it work then you press go
6256216 someone should do a documentary on that whole scene which has so many passionate people involved
6256217 i learned a lot about the operations of a company that is for very good reasons held in high regard
6256218 but it taught me not to be afraid of the big boys of the theatre world this is not a slight on mtc but i knew i wasnt going to last there very long its very traditional i wanted room to grow and do my own stuff
6256219 ross was lamenting the fact his play constructions of the human heart was not likely to be published after successful seasons and a string of awards he thought it deserved to be published and i turned to him and asked what does that involve why couldnt i do it he laughed and told me i was completely insane
6256220 and i knew it was a niche market but i also know there are many small theatre groups out there and a lot of wannabe actors as well as proper actors who might want access to printed scripts
6256221 i want to see how these two go then we can sit down with companies who are doing new work and talk about how to co publish the plays
6256222 in new york we dont think of alternative power as something that we just import from other parts of the nation
6256223 good old supply and demand have displaced imminent peak oil and a perceived commodity bubble as the dominant narrative
6256224 opec member countries facing increased government spending and rising inflation will not be happy to see prices fall far below 100 per barrel
6256225 japan consumes 14 barrels of oil a year per capita
6256226 if china used the same amount per capita as parsimonious japan chinese consumption would total more than 18 billion barrels a year an amount that dwarfs our countrys 7 5 billion barrels
6256227 add that to new demand for oil stemming from india the newest members of the european community an increasingly prosperous brazil and so on for those trying to discern the long term future of oil prices this is considerable food for thought
6256228 we literally generated whole tubes in the lab from scratch
6256229 the beautiful thing is that you start with one line expand them indefinitely and generate as many as you want
6256230 at this stage the work is very promising but has not progressed to the stage where the cultured cells are fully equivalent
6256231 much more work will yet be needed before this becomes a practical reality
6256232 with high food prices they are actually quite an attractive option if you like producing your own food
6256233 both my husband and i have full time jobs so were keeping them on the side as an interest they do largely look after themselves and theyve been hugely popular with the children
6256234 they have a phenomenal reputation for the quality of the beef
6256235 as long as youve got plenty of grass they will be fine you dont really have to feed them
6256236 people are realising that if youve got a couple of acres you can just stick them there
6256237 they eat grass so they are very cost effective and they have a lovely temperament
6256238 the government has no interest in where our food comes from or how it tastes so its nice to set your own welfare and quality standards
6256239 if youve got a bit of land a breed like the dexter can work out a lot cheaper than the supermarket plus they do a pretty good job of mowing the lawn
6256240 as time passes after my earthly extinction my writings will carry on beyond my years
6256241 always the professional he waited until his audience was in place and he passed away
6256242 i think he was most proud of works of that nature
6256243 stories about life on the streets of western australia rather than the rich epic novels of australian life
6256244 it was one of those times that reminded you that working in theatre is about teamwork
6256245 we used to gather and read each others scripts and it made you feel there was a writing community in perth
6256246 everyones been trying to carve out their territory and every few years we rearrange ourselves if you have a very healthy major company it bodes well for the rest of us providing we all have the financial backing to go with it
6256247 fought for a great concept national tours of local plays
6256248 brought a heart warming and refreshing wa perspective right around the nation
6256249 i wish he hadnt fixed me i dont want to be fixed i want to break with him i dont need anyone else why didnt they take me because they can have me how am i supposed to live without him ive never had to do that before there is just no world without him why could they fix me and why cant they do that for him i dont care if its in his blood or his lungs or his heart he is mine and they cant have him
6256250 i have been working on the endangered species act for 15 years and have never seen such a sneaky attack
6256251 with this change the bush administration threatens to undo more than 30 years of progress
6256252 this move is consistent with other efforts by the administration to cement industry friendly policies before leaving office in january
6256253 there is nothing that allows an agency of the federal government to not obey the endangered species act and the agencies are liable under civil and criminal penalties if they do not obey
6256254 proposed rule is consistent with the fws fish and wildlife service current understanding it is not possible to draw a direct causal link
6256255 it takes great hubris to resurrect an issue the court has already definitely struck down
6256256 this is like a zombie movie their proposal to toss the endangered species act over the cliff died but now has somehow come back to life
6256257 this is akin to a drug company suppressing results showing that a medicine is killing people and then trying to put the medicine broadly on the market
6256258 as president senator obama will fight to maintain the strong protections of the endangered species act and undo this proposal from president bush
6256259 after over 30 years of successfully protecting our nations most endangered wildlife like the bald eagle we should be looking for ways to improve it not weaken it
6256260 we are ready to co operate with russia in any project that can strengthen its security
6256261 i think russia really has to think of the response it will make when it finds itself closed in a circle
6256262 gal hirsch who was defeated in lebanon went to georgia and they too lost because of him
6256263 relying on israeli experts and weapons georgia learnt why the israeli generals failed
6256264 youll love it because it would make a great tea house
6256265 most people have never heard of a two headed turtle
6256266 it looks like they searched the entire store and they could not find the turtle
6256267 i guess this qualifies as a missing turtle report but i dont think were out there looking for it
6256268 in the wild they would have zero chance in captivity most die within a few days of birth
6256269 they were trying the best they could but the turtle was just starting to waste away it wasnt feeding properly
6256270 they dont have the ability to dive and swim the way a normal turtle will if they are put into deep water they will actually drown
6256271 they will flip themselves over and they cant right themselves because one head is going one way while the other head is going the other way

6256323 im not saying hes going to win the heisman but

6256349 will that be the motto come to my university drink as much as you can as long as you pay your tuition do you think you send your son or daughter to come home as an alcoholic thats a bad message im sorry you have enough time to drink the rest of your life
6256350 you think the president of the university is gonna open a beer hall in his house do you think the coach of the baseball team or football team will open it up they should raise their standards and think that drinking is not part of college life everybody has responsibility on this and drinking at universities isnt something you should be proud of you dont send your son or daughter to learn how to drink at universities you send em for an education
6256351 students at colleges and universities across the country and unfortunately at many high schools are already drinking despite the fact that the lawful age is 21 they drink in private they drink in hiding they sometimes go off campus to places to drink that are dangerous they may drive while doing that
6256352 there is a real argument that needs to be considered about whether it would be safer for them to drink lawfully on campus where responsible use of alcohol could be modeled
6256353 ive seen many people who lost their family life because their father or mother drank they died at an early age it should not be so whimsical that universities think they should drop the drinking age

6256369 sometimes its hard for the cuban people to believe how difficult it is to build a team after so many defections and only one year before the olympics
6256370 now we are proud of our results and we can already say that weve made it
6256371 i think we have a higher level than the rest of the teams i admire the discipline and the camaraderie that this team has because when we work as a team we got good results
6256372 we have a very scientific approach theyre very young theyre a new team but they have been through a lot of international fights at the pan american games
6256373 they may be young but they have a lot of experience and they train very hard the winning factor is that they do a lot of physical training but also a lot of psychological work
6256374 i believe we have opened the doorway to the medals im very excited and proud of all my fighters
6256375 cuba has a boxing culture we have a very strict training system theyre a young team but they did a lot of hard work

6256378 the investigation has already begun to uncover some disturbing facts that seem to belie the innocent picture of downstream brokerages you paint in your letter
6256379 for example some evidence indicates that fidelity was actively marketing
6256380 fidelity does not actively market these securities and does not offer special financial incentives to representatives if they sell these securities
6256381 deliberately stuck their heads in the sand but continued to actively market these products to unknowing investors that will certainly be relevant to our calculus of the firms culpability
6256382 take full appropriate measures against any firms or individuals who have violated securities laws and we fully support them in their efforts

6256406 i want the burden of clearing this up to be on the agencies that are the holders of responsibilities the department of homeland security and the attorney general of the united states
6256407 as we approach the third anniversary of hurricane katrina and the flooding that followed it is important that our residents transition from trailers into safer more permanent housing
6256408 while we understand that we must make exceptions in some cases the elimination of trailers for housing is a priority as we move toward the full recovery of our community
6256409 sadly there are those among us who would go to great lengths to illegally exploit the benefits funded by taxpayers which are intended to help our citizens who lost their homes through a great disaster
6256410 although the first in our district will not by any means be the last as
6256411 our goal is to create a safer environment for our residents and we are urging all citizens to stop at red lights which prevents crashes and injuries that are often the result of these violations
6256412 weve worked hard to publicize the program and encourage the public to follow the law
6256413 looking at the number of citations issued in just the first week its clear that new orleans needs these red light enforcement cameras and we look forward to seeing a reduction in traffic violations over the next several months
6256414 weve had many demonstrations to highlight whats happening and the media doesnt show up
6256415 where is our black media where is the louisiana weekly or the new orleans are they
6256416 people call me and common ground takes care of their properties while they are still living in other states
6256417 but the city is tearing down houses too not just the housing projects
6256418 we have been deeply troubled by the lack of responsiveness by some federal and state appraiser regulators in carrying out
6256419 we hope this article proves to be a catalyst for modernizing the existing appraisal regulatory structure and making it more effective
6256420 make it clear to allstate that we need to continue to raise awareness about hurricane preparedness among coastal residents
6256421 we had set aside some of what was given to us for needs that would emerge later in the recovery effort but the reality is that in the hardest hit areas peoples needs today are the same as they were months ago emotional support an expert navigator advocate and resources to rebuild a life
6256422 we were pleased to see femas announcement last week extending their funding for case management in some areas coupled with these additional resources we know more survivors will be able to move toward a safe and sustainable living environment
6256423 the fact that survivors continue to sign up is an indication that the assistance is still greatly needed
6256424 this program has been vitally important not only to the survivors but to the mental health communities in louisiana and mississippi
6256425 its troubling that icf was given a pay raise in spite of their
6256426 this is a new era for families of new orleans who want to come back home and work and restore themselves to home ownership or move up to home ownership
6256427 this is the ideal way to build an american middle class and provide a way to achieve the american dream for working families in this area
6256428 we first offered these units for sale in may of last year and then were hit with the housing finance crisis
6256429 we have spent almost a year trying to convince banks and other lenders to provide loans to people in our area with less than perfect credit scores
6256430 we are looking for other opportunities not only to assist in the rebuilding of this great american city but also to help families find workforce housing around the country we welcome other developers to join with us in these public private partnerships that bring all of our resources to bear on the nations housing crisis
6256431 i know that banks arent anxious to help people like me who had problems making a few payments on time after the hurricane
6256432 because ill be paying 830 a month instead of 1200 a month to rent somewhere ill be saving almost 4500 a year and building equity for myself and my family
6256433 the cosmetics industry has borrowed a page from the playbook of the tobacco industry by putting profits ahead of public health

6256456 what has been achieved is substantial but it is also reversible
6256457 first the sunni awakening which preceded the surge second the sadr cease fire third sectarian cleansing that left much of baghdad segregated with fewer targets to shoot or bomb these tactical gains are relative violence is now where it was in 2005 and spiking up again iraq is still incredibly dangerous and despite what the president says very far from normal and these gains are fragile awakening members frustrated at the governments refusal to integrate them into the national security forces could turn their guns back on us
6256458 you are asking us for millions more to pay off the militias and by the way i have an article here that says maliki recently told a london paper that he was concerned about half of them
6256459 why dont you ask the iraqis to pay the entire cost of that progam
6256460 to support the iraqi government in its battle with all outlaw groups thats a pretty expansive commitment
6256461 there is no iraqi government that we know of that will be in place a year from now half the government has walked out we want to normalize a government that really doesnt exist
6256462 given the fact that the maliki government doesnt represent a true coalition wont this agreement make it appear we are taking sides in the civil war especially when most iraqi parliamentarians have called for a withdrawal of troops
6256463 that over the past five years the united nations has continued to help the people of iraq and others throughout the world who suffer from violence disease and want

6256470 they were wearing khaki their weapons were american the humvees they used looked american they didnt have any ranks on their shoulders they didnt talk
6256471 these special forces work with the americans they are not associated with the ministry of defense they have goals and they didnt inform anyone else
6256472 both men arrested are sunni muslims and the iraqi islamic party the largest sunni party in the country immediately condemned the raids as part of a sectarian campaign by the largely shiite muslim security forces

6256484 these counties lacked the infrastructure and capacity to obtain the depth of external resource they needed to address their unique needs we saw the devastation and united ways of alabama made it a priority to help ivan and katrina victims by focusing specifically on the lack of affordable quality housing
6256485 with the focus of the country on reconstruction of damaged areas in louisiana and mississippi this poor region of alabama has been under everyones radar screen until now

6256487 make the evening his never complain if he comes home late or goes out to dinner or other places of entertainment without you instead try to understand his world of strain and pressure and his very real need to be at home and relax let him talk first remember his topics of conversation are more important than yours dont complain if he is late home for dinner or even if he stays out all night count this as minor compared to what he might have gone through that day remember he is the master of the house and as such he will always exercise his will with fairness and truthfulness you have no right to question him
6256488 all i can say at this point is that in the recent past several of our officers involved in another incident were apparently fired upon in the same block
6256489 we took extra precautions in investigating this incident we took a numerous amount of officers in checked the area to make sure there were no additional victims and to make sure we werent fired upon as we continued our investigation

6256500 i think it leads to more people being clinically obese and when you start in high school it doesnt help
6256501 this bill is inconsistent with our economic development strategy it would send a bad message to businesses as to whether or not we want them to come into san jose
6256502 can i just give you my recommendation from the health department its your health department too your time is up im sorry
6256503 what this ban would do if it is like the los angeles ban it would stop us in our tracks and we wouldnt be able to put anymore restaurants down here
6256504 this is not about the economics of this city this is about our children its about the future

6256510 the driver of the ford involved in the crash was standing next to his vehicle because he did not suffer any injuries
6256511 there was a good samaritan who stopped to see if he was okay and shortly thereafter was struck by a passing vehicle unfortunately the good samaritan died of his injuries
6256512 in our minds both collisions were caused by both drivers going much too fast for the conditions
6256513 the deans secretary was back in about five minutes with a xerox copy of an ibm printout of terry orchards schedule

6256518 this compromise budget proposal puts our state on the road to fiscal sanity and will give california a budget that works
6256519 substituting one tax increase for another is not a bipartisan compromise nor will it solve our long term budget problems
6256520 increasing taxes on hard working californians whether temporary or permanent is not only unnecessary it is irresponsible
6256521 i have made it very clear that we cannot tax our way out of this problem i do not believe in tax increases
6256522 i dont want to go back and ask them for any tax increases they deserve better than that
6256523 i think it is key for us that we finish this year with victories and not another year where nothing gets done just because everyone is stuck in their ideology

6256540 there is no pool in jenin where i am studying
6256541 sometimes people cut across me and others would get angry when i swam into them but quite a few made way for me
6256542 i got so depressed sometimes i couldnt help crying but my parents and friends encouraged me reminding me that i had to keep training if i really wanted to go to the olympics
6256543 participating in a race at the olympics was a once in a lifetime experience
6256544 i am such a fan of their pan fried noodle dishes
6256545 we rethought those plans and came up with a way to put a lid on the cells instead of the razor wire
6256546 the important thing is this has to function as a normal jail
6256547 the nature of jail is to create an environment where you can maintain security and order and one of our primary charges is the care and custody of inmates
6256548 capitol briefing sincerely apologizes for the confusion and will continue to update
6256549 i think theres a lot of soul searching going on here about this

6256557 people began to behave to one another decently thieves declared that they would stop stealing since the police had more important things to do everything unbelievable was possible
6256558 i thought wow we must find a way to get this stuff out
6256559 has more energy than most 20 year olds i know
6256560 because of the sad events in georgia this becomes all the more relevant and resonant
6256561 ive always been into motorcycles but as i got older i became fascinated with vintage british and japanese bikes
6256562 board track bikes are the most stripped down streamlined head to the ground pure racers around
6256563 just crazy motherfuckers man racing on sketchy wooden plank tracks at 100 miles an hour on a bike with no suspension and tires as wide as a matchbook with 50 other dudes pure insanity i love it
6256564 we picked up various trash used condoms empty beer bottles empty wine bottles whiskey bottles and drug paraphernalia
6256565 ive seen kids shot ive seen several fights break out ive had to referee some of them
6256566 effective immediately all teen parties production events will cease at l r hall
6256567 theres no question about this five hundred and twenty nine police incident calls and reports in a 4 block area around this one particular place
6256568 when you put profits over public safety then people have to come out and act and this is what it has come to
6256569 ive driven by many a time but was turned off by the wait
6256570 i wont like you if you dont order something expensive

6256576 a well placed official in the russian ministry of defense
6256577 to freeze all military cooperation with nato and allied countries
6256578 it is our understanding that other nato countries will receive similar notes
6256579 if this indeed is the case it would be unfortunate we need to work with russia on a range of security issues but we are obviously very concerned about russian behavior in georgia
6256580 she said they could see the fire and then it was not even a minute or so they heard something blow up
6256581 they were about 200 meters 660 feet in the air and then they were landing but not crashing they were landing like little by little it was not like they fell down suddenly
6256582 the government will do all it can to support the families in this difficult situation
6256583 the whole government logically is affected very affected as are all spanish citizens by this tragedy
6256584 to create a zombie you need to change their brains
6256585 many of the elements that people understand and know we wouldnt dare to use them anymore
6256586 i was skeptical because it was definitely outside the box
6256587 but cafa is one of the most impressive design schools ive ever been in
6256588 this is something that has made me sleepless made me really lose a lot of weight and gain a lot of weight
6256589 we see our designs as kind of a door into chinese culture
6256590 i have traveled in over 50 countries and i do believe there is little understanding of china today
6256591 and im sure there are many more rich cultural elements and traditions in china that we need to discover by ourselves too
6256592 we have to have some different perspectives on our own culture
6256593 some ancient cultures belong to us and not every country can really claim that but we dont want to create a situation where we need to force visitors to understand
6256594 the result is that i had to forget all of them we had to create something new
6256595 this is our chance to show the new look of our homeland to the world
6256596 to a certain extent the greatest pressure comes from our own sense of responsibility
6256597 as we design we are trying to keep our original ideas
6256598 there have been a lot of arguments its very important that we fight for what we want
6256599 theres a shift happening now from the factory driven model to the creative innovating one
6256600 the government is creating a more relaxed environment to allow investment into this area but its been difficult for the government to understand what creativity actually is
6256601 i see myself as a renaissance woman i can teach the food network viewer everything from cooking to crafts to how to set your table and have it look like a 100 000 event
6256602 half an hour later just by chance a door to door baby photographer happened to ring the doorbell hoping to make a sale good morning maam
6256603 well thats good did you know babies are my specialty
6256604 well thats what my husband and i had hoped please come in and have a seat
6256605 bathtub living room floor no wonder it didnt work out for harry and me
6256606 well maam none of us can guarantee a good one every time
6256607 maam in my line of work a man has to take his time
6256608 and these twins turned out exceptionally well when you consider
6256609 yes im afraid so i finally had to take her to the park to get the job done right people were crowding around four and five deep to get a good look
6256610 and for more than three hours too the mother was constantly squealing and yelling i could hardly concentrate and when darkness approached i had to rush my shots finally when the squirrels began nibbling on my equipment i just had to pack it all in
6256611 oh yes maam i need to use a tripod to rest my canon on kit

6256621 oh yes maam i need to use a tripod to rest my canon on kit
6256622 its amazing how much lower the water level is than how i remembered it
6256623 you wonder whats causing the problems is it man made or natural
6256624 it has nothing to do with growth it has everything to do with global warming
6256625 one of the issues is invasive species that we dont know how to deal with right now
6256626 everyone knows about the project bringing water from lincoln and white plain counties and thats ongoing as we speak

6256630 you cant grab your food you cant grab your tv grab what you can and go
6256631 i had no idea what it looked like out there until today
6256632 it pretty much came up to my ears and chin
6256633 i saw this little kid coming toward me so i grabbed him and swam him back to the shore line and went back for the other two guys
6256634 theyre probably areas of the state that found the rains very beneficial
6256635 theres a big negative feedback loop and theres no way out of it
6256636 as the stock falls more and more its more likely the government steps in and more likely equity holders get wiped out
6256637 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything
6256638 they cant keep playing games with the accounting rules to avoid taking their losses
6256639 it could be tomorrow it could be six months from now
6256640 a lifelike multishaded rendering of san diegos blend of cultures classes ancestries and motivations

6256647 dr ben cunneen hes been a very valuable employee with us for quite a long time dr lovell said on abc radio
6256648 he was the first person who became infected in this outbreak and hes been very very seriously ill in hospital
6256649 i just spare a thought for them for the last five weeks i guess it is theyve virtually had to maintain a vigil with him against overwhelming odds of any chance of success it is terrible
6256650 its just terrible theyre very very upset dr lovell said
6256651 hes been like part of the family for a long long time
6256652 i think weve got some good news there i think shes doing quite well he said
6256653 dr ben cunneen hes been a very valuable employee with us for quite a long time dr lovell said on abc radio

6256655 by definition anything from cook is pretty rare and pretty magical
6256656 there are incredibly few things which is why this auction is so exciting and also because its a boomerang which is such an iconic thing
6256657 there are plenty of cook collectors and i would think some australian institutions would be interested
6256658 to begin with you are devastated because you only know that the person was on the plane you dont know if they are alright if they are among the dead you feel totally powerless said ricardo whose brother in law was among the survivors
6256659 it was very hard to arrive at the scene of the accident we have saved those we could said miguel angel sanchez who was in charge of the fire service operation
6256660 we have set up several special rooms in the airport to look after the families psychologist juan antonio carujo said on cadena ser radio
6256661 but the uncertainty makes the situation all the more stressful
6256662 while we continue to see volatility in international markets and increases in the average cost of long term funding we have experienced some short term funding relief which we are keen to pass on to our customers he said
6256663 while i am pleased to make todays undertaking our medium and long term funding and our retail deposit base represent the greatest proportion of our funding costs and the average cost of these sources of funding continue to increase
6256664 the recent fall in short term funding costs provides an opportunity to undertake to move rates in line with the rba decision but future interest rate decisions will need to reflect an assessment of all the cost of funding factors
6256665 all australian banks are reliant on offshore funding and increases in the average cost of long term funding are likely to be with us for some time
6256666 therefore any consideration that the federal government can give to enhance the attractiveness of retail bank deposits will help reduce overall funding costs and assist in lowering mortgages rates
6256667 clearly we would love to pass through the full 25 basis points drop if that were to occur but well need to factor in all of those issues at that time she told an investor briefing
6256668 if lower short term money market rates are sustained and the reserve bank lowers the official cash rate there will be flow onto anzs variable rates an anz spokeswoman said this morning
6256669 they the opposition are the ones that really matter he said to abc radio
6256670 they are the ones that should be looking at what they are doing particularly on budget measures
6256671 and any erosion of that by the liberal party through the senate will ultimately be at their peril
6256672 they should ensure that the government has got the ability to put downward pressure on interest rates and to help the reserve bank do its jobs
6256673 now there are 5000 member of the windows team plus an additional 5000 contributing partners generating over 50 million lines of code for windows server 2003 its the biggest software engineering task ever attempted there are no other software projects like this

6256675 ticking theological time bomb that when it goes off will ignite the new springtime of evangelization
6256676 i remember thinking as i read it theology of the body for the first time that somehow i had chanced upon the long lost treasure that every person longed for the path to the banquet of love that truly satisfies the hungers of the human heart
6256677 im delighted to welcome such a diverse group of member companies

6256681 my ipod touch cant be updated because the disk you are attempting to use is full
6256682 were very supportive of paying royalties but this structure is wrong unfair and unaffordable
6256683 it doesnt look to us like the industry that dying
6256684 you cant just look at the percentage of revenue quote and think that tells whole story
6256685 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words
6256686 i understand where you are coming from but how many real bigfoot researchers are out there trekking 140 000 miles a year
6256687 just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
6256688 they dont have a choice to believe us we have a body
6256689 we thought it was the answer to a mystery thats been going on for too long
6256690 has violated the duty of a police officer once he perpetrated a fraud it goes into his credibility and integrity
6256691 in relation to foreigners holding demonstrations in beijing in support of tibet independence competent authorities have the right to handle these things according to law
6256692 id also like to emphasize that in china activities that support tibet independence will be strongly condemned by the chinese people and will not be welcomed
6256693 im afraid my wife isnt safe we think the olympics should be held but i am just not in the mood to watch it
6256694 in china as in other countries applications for demonstrations must go through legal procedures
6256695 the critical problem in the murray darling basin is one that no government can easily fix
6256696 in an age of climate change and during a prolonged drought we simply have less water in the basin
6256697 part of trying to deal with that is the water buyback and the problem with queensland is dealt with by the fact that of the 400 million we have reserved as part of the buyback 350 million is being reserved for queensland
6256698 the nature of the water system is that the further south you go the tougher people tend to be doing it right through until you reach the end of the system in south australia
6256699 so i can absolutely understand the frustration that so many farmers feel and the water that they know would produce a profitable crop in a properly irrigated area simply isnt available on zero allocations
6256700 tv will fundamentally change how we talk about imagine and experience the internet
6256701 this effort is one of what we believe will be many exciting new ways to bring the internet to the tv and it really shows the potential of what consumers can look forward to

6256710 made the gdc his passion and took on the art form that is games as his personal cause
6256711 i realized that surviving is not just about physically surviving its more about spiritually surviving ive met people who were not physically hurt by the bomb but who were really destroyed by what they went through when you do a film like this youre getting the story of the people whove survived in all ways not just physically i mean there are people in the film who live in constant pain one of the survivors in the film had to take breaks every couple of hours so she could rest and take her morphine
6256712 our endeavor in using these bombs was to win the war end the war as soon as possible and win the war no sympathy no uh regrets
6256713 it had worked as designed but it had done what war does it destroys people
6256714 we used some propaganda films and in one the former ambassador to japan is describing the japanese people all you have to do is exchange the word japanese with arab and its the same description the same excuse for going to war its a 2 000 year old culture and religion and the people dont care about life on earth because theyll be rewarded in heaven of course its also a description of christianity how you make it okay to kill people is you make them really foreign and abstract and i think that the film has a disturbing relevance now and the possibility of nuclear weapons is closer to home now i think theres a really strong curiosity today because were living in a world where people are aware of how dangerous this is im startled that people have been so interested in the film i expected more denial more avoidance its really gratifying to see how much interest there is in the story
6256715 theyre not like us they dont think like us they dont live like us

6256719 when it comes to antioxidant content peanuts are right up there with strawberries we expected a fairly high antioxidant content in peanuts but we were a bit shocked to find that theyre as rich in antioxidants as many kinds of fruit

6256724 so i can absolutely understand the frustration that so many farmers feel and the water that they know would produce a profitable crop in a properly irrigated area simply isnt available on zero allocations
6256725 that is the reason why we are looking at the buyback and why so much of it is geared towards the northern end of the system

6256746 i learned that running for the state legislature is a lot different than running for the school board
6256747 i pretty much assumed that mrs ybarra would be one of the six because she was the lone democrat running
6256748 both johnson and ybarra say walking neighborhoods like this and meeting the folks had a lot to do with their initial success but now that the list of candidates is narrowed down their strategies are going to have to become more concentrated
6256749 being down to one opponent will help us focus a little more
6256750 it will help us get out our message that this election is about the future of yakima

6256777 only 38 per cent of the uks total water use comes from its own rivers lakes and groundwater reserves
6256778 the rest is taken from water bodies in many countries across the world to irrigate and process food and fibre crops that people in britain subsequently consume
6256779 whats particularly worrying is that huge amounts of these products are grown in drier areas of the world where water resources are either already stressed or very likely to become so in the near future
6256780 most people arent even aware that it takes massive amounts of water to grow the food and fibres we consume on top of what is used for drinking and washing and watering the lawn
6256781 therefore it is essential that business and government identify the areas that could potentially suffer water crises and develop solutions so the environment is not overexploited to the point that people and wildlife lose out
6256782 the private sector has a very important role to play it can engage with governments and communities along its supply chain to support better water management
6256783 in order to reduce risk businesses need to do their utmost to encourage more efficient and effective water use in water stressed areas where they operate
6256784 this is not just an issue for food and clothing companies producers and retailers insurers and investors have a vested interest in encouraging efficiency of water use and security of water supply in an ever thirstier world water is irreplaceable and climate change and population growth are only going to exacerbate the problem
6256785 theres an important role for the public here as a consumer you can ask businesses including your local supermarkets to tell you what they are doing to ensure good water management along their supply chains as a citizen you can urge your government to make good water management a priority both in this country and overseas but if we do nothing to alleviate the acute pressures on water resources at home and abroad then our inaction could have far reaching consequences for people and habitats
6256786 we would like to see the vat regime reformed so that products that have a long life cycle or can be easily and cheaply repaired rather than replaced are made economically more attractive
6256787 this would be an important step in turning away from the throwaway consumer culture we currently have
6256788 manufacturers who behave irresponsibly face financial consequences and those who are doing the right thing are supported
6256789 if our society was to implement the hierarchy effectively a far smaller amount of waste would need to be disposed of after all the previous stages had been put into practice
6256790 we can expect with high probability this year will be cooler than the previous five years
6256791 definitely the la nina should have had an effect how much we cannot say
6256792 up to july 2008 this year has been cooler than the previous five years at least it still looks like its warmer than average
6256793 of course at the begining of the year there was la nina and that would have had the effect of suppressing temperatures somewhat as well

6256796 we have to strengthen control measures in ivory trade to abide by provisions of the convention in trade international trade in endangered species cites which requires specific legislation

6256798 the temporary moratorium will start on september 1 until the controlled wildlife products bill is enacted
6256799 this is a very short notice just 11 days before the ban comes into effect but in principle it is a good thing although we cannot sell ivory jewellery already on our shelves for a while
6256800 geothermal energy which is sometimes known as hot rocks has got a huge potential for australia both as a solution to climate change and in terms of national energy security
6256801 one percent of reserves would produce 26 000 years of energy supplies
6256802 the upper cost boundary will decline over time because the level of uncertainty is expected to narrow as the industry grows this cost is expected to be lowest cost of any form of renewable or low emissions energy
6256803 geothermal energy provides clean base load power and is potentially a very important contributor to australias energy mix in a carbon constrained world

6256898 bangsat tua she in itu hutang tiga pukulan cit siang koen sesudah aku menghajar dia kita boleh bicara lagi
6256899 tapi menurut penglihatan boanpwee latihan cianpwee dalam ilmu itu masih jauh dari cukup
6256900 cong cianpwee bukankah kau sering merasa sakit pada in boen hiat di pundakmu in boen hiat berhubungan dengan paru paru itu berarti paru paru cianpwee sudah terluka bukankah ceng leng hiat cianpwee di lengan terasa gatal gatal ceng leng hiat berhubungan langsung dengan jantung dan itu berarti bahwa jantung cianpwee telah terluka setiap hawa lembab dan turun hujan betis cianpwee di bagian ngo lie hiat terasa lemas bukankah begitu ngo lie hiat berhubungan dengan hati dan aku berani mengatakan bahwa hati cianpwee juga ikut terluka makin lama cianpwee berlatih tanda tanda itu akan makin terasa kalau cianpwee berlatih terus enam tujuh tahun lagi maka sekujur tubuh cianpwee akan menjadi lumpuh
6256901 jika cianpwee percaya sesudah urusan ini beres boanpwee bersedia mengobati tapi bagi cianpwee cit siang koen banyak bahayanya dan tiada gunanya sebaiknya cianpwee tidak berlatih ilmu itu lagi
6256902 cit siang koen adalah ilmu terhebat dari khong tong pay sehingga bagaimana bisa kau katakan bahwa ilmu itu banyak bahaya dan tiada gunanya
6256903 dahulu ciang boen soe cow kami yaitu bok leng coe telah mengguncang seluruh rimba persilatan nama harumnya dikenal di empat penjuru dan ia berusia sampai sembilan puluh satu tahun inilah bukti bahwa cit siang koen tidak mencelakai orang yang mempelajarinya bocah kau jangan bicara sembarangan
6256904 kalau begitu bisalah dipastikan bahwa lweekang bok leng coe cianpwee sudah mencapai taraf yang cukup
6256905 seseorang yang tenaga dalamnya cukup tentu saja boleh berlatih ilmu tersebut ia bukan saja tidak akan mendapat bahaya malah akan memperoleh keuntungan besar karena cit siang koen dapat memperkuat isi perut manusia kalau cianpwee tidak percaya omonganku terserahlah tapi boanpwee tetap berpendapat bahwa lweekang cianpwee belum cukup tinggi untuk berlatih cit siang koen
6256906 kalau kau bilang cit siang koen tidak berguna cobalah jajal
6256907 aku tidak mengatakan bahwa ilmu itu tak berguna maksudku hanya bahwa jika lweekang seseorang belum cukup tinggi biarpun dia berlatih lama latihan itu tiada gunanya
6256908 tapi menurut penglihatanku waktu berlatih cit siang koen cianpwee telah terluka sehingga sebaiknya latihan itu tidak diteruskan
6256909 dia menghina cit siang koen kita biarlah dia rasakan pukulanku
6256910 kau tak usah khawatir pukulan cit siang koen itu sedikitpun tiada gunanya
6256911 kau memiliki kim kong poet hoay tee sin kang apa kau murid siauw lim sie
6256912 aku bukan murid siauw lim sie tapi benar aku pernah belajar ilmu di kuil siauw lim sie
6256913 kalau seseorang sudah melatih diri dalam kim kong poet hoay tee sampai pada puncak kesempurnaan ia tak akan bisa diserang walaupun ia sedang bicara tanpa menggunakan lweekang tubuhnya tidak bisa kena segala pukulan jika kau tidak percaya kau boleh memukul lagi
6256914 pemuda itu mengatakan bahwa dia sudah pernah belajar ilmu siauw lim sie siapa dia
6256915 kim kong poet hoay tee tak pernah diturunkan kepada orang luar di samping itu kong kian taysoe dalam partai kita tiada orang lain memiliki ilmu tersebut pemuda itu masih begitu muda mana bisa dia mempunya ilmu yang harus dilatih selama empat puluh tahun
6256916 can heng aku merasa sangat kagum akan sin kangmu apa boleh aku menerima pelajaran darimu dalam tiga jurus
6256917 terima kasih atas budi can heng yang sudah membalas kejahatan dengan kebaikan sungguh sungguh aku merasa malu dan berterima kasih tidak habisnya
6256918 barusan kie keng pat meh pembuluh darah cianpwee telah mendapat sedikit bantuan dan sebaiknya cianpwee mengaso sambil mengerahkan hawa dengan demikian racun yang berkumpul dalam tubuh sebagai akibat latihan cit siang koen akan dapat disingkirkan dalam waktu dua atau tiga tahun
6256919 cobalah cianpwee minta sam hong po la wan dari boe tong pay dan bubuk giok cin san dari hwa san pay
6256920 dengan menggunakan rumput co o koyo hwee yang giok liong dari partai cianpwee sangat mujarab
6256921 dalam sam hong po la wan dari boe tong pay terdapat thiun tiok hong hiong hong dan tang hong ditambah dengan giok cin san maka dalam waktu dua bulan saja kesehatan tong cianpwee akan pulih seperti biasa lagi
6256922 orang she can bahwa kau telah menyambung tulangku aku merasa sangat berterima kasih dan di kemudian hari nanti aku pasti akan membalas budimu tapi permusuhan antara khong tong pay dan mo kauw sedalam lautan tak bisa kami sudahi karena budimu jika kau anggap melupakan budi kau boleh mematahkan lagi tulang kaki tanganku
6256923 cara bagaimanakah baru cianpwee bisa merasa puas dan sudi menyudahi permusuhan ini
6256924 jika khong tong pay merasa tak bisa menandingi barulah kami tak bisa berkata apa apa lagi
6256925 dalam khong tong pay terdapat banyak sekali orang pandai sehingga biar bagaimanapun juga boanpwee takkan bisa menandingi
6256926 boanpwee pernah belajar cit siang koen dan kini boanpwee ingin memperlihatkan kebodohan sendiri boanpwee mohon para cianpwee supaya tidak menertawai
6256927 hawa ngo heng dicampur im yang merusak jantung melukai paru paru hati dan usus tenaga hilang pikiran kalang kabut semangat terbang
6256928 itulah cit siang koen yang tertinggi aku merasa takluk tapi bolehkah aku bertanya dari mana can siauw hiap belajar ilmu itu
6256929 di mana adanya kim mo say ong cia soen beritahukanlah
6256930 dengan memperlihatkan cit siang koen aku menyeret gie hoe jika aku bicara terus terang peranan damai tidak dapat dipegang lagi olehku
6256931 apakah cianpwee menganggap kitab cit siang koen dirampas oleh kim mo say ong ha ha cianpwee salah salah besar kitab itu dicuri oleh hoen goan pek lek chioe seng koen malam itu ketika terjadi pertempuran di kuil ceng yang koen gunung khong tong san bukankah ada dua orang yang kena pukulan hoen goan kang katakanlah boanpwee benar atau salah
6256932 apakah can siauw hiap tahu di mana adanya seng koen sekarang
6256933 dengan menggunakan semua kepandaiannya seng koen mengadu domba enam partai besar dan beng kauw
6256934 belakangan ia menjadi murid siauw lin dan sebagai seorang pertapa ia memakai nama goan tin di kuil siauw lim sie dia pernah mengajar ilmu silat kepada boanpwee jika dusta boanpwee rela menerima hukuman seberat beratnya di akhirat dan biarlah boanpwee tidak bisa lahir lagi di dunia
6256935 can sie coe bagaimana kau bernai menuduh murid siauw lim sie secara sembarangan
6256936 taysoe janganlah kau gusar jika taysoe bisa memanggil goan tin taysoe akan segera tahu duduk persoalannya
6256937 aku minta goan tin hweeshio keluar hanya untuk menjelaskan persoalan ini di hadapan para orang gagah
6256938 ia mengorbankan jiwa untuk partai kami sesudah meninggal dunia nama baiknya tak dapat
6256939 selama hidup kau melakukan berbagai kejahatan tapi kau mendapat juga bagianmu di hari ini
6256940 sesudah kena pukulan han peng bian ciang dari ceng ek hok ong goan tin terluka berat karena itu paman berhasil membinasakannya sungguh menyenangkan bahwa paman sudah berhasil membalas sakit hati ini
6256941 jelas jelas kau tahu bahwa goan tin soetit sudah binasa tapi kau masih juga berusaha untuk menimpakan segala dosa di atas pundaknya
6256942 kau terlalu jahat dan aku tidak dapat mengampuni kau hari ini aku terpaksa membuka larangan membunuh pilihlah kau mati bunuh diri atau dibinasakan olehku
6256943 kebinasaan goan tin merupakan ganjaran setimpal bagi dirinya dan kejadian ini sangat menggirangkan
6256944 tapi dengan binasanya pendeta itu aku tak punya saksi lagi dan urusan jadi makin susah dipecahkan bagaimana baiknya
6256945 dengan mengandalkan kegesitannya ia berhasil menyelamatkan diri dari pukulan pukulan tapi kalau bertempur sungguhan belum tentu ia bisa melayani dua belas pukulan liong jiauw chioe
6256946 tidak sukar bagiku mengambil jiwanya tapi siauw lim pay mempunyai nama besar sedangkan kong seng taysoe adalah salah seorang dari ketiga pendeta suci apabila dengan gegabah lalu aku merobohkannya di hadapan orang banyak di mana siauw lim pay mau menaruh muka tapi bila tidak dirobohkan dia pasti tak akan mau mundur
6256947 tapi kamu jangan harap bisa menandingi aku dalam suatu pertempuran yang sungguh sungguh
6256948 dalam pie boe tak seorangpun bisa meramalkan siapa bakal menang siapa bakal kalah
6256949 usia boanpwee lebih muda daripada taysoe tapi biarpun kalah ilmu boanpwee mungkin menang tenaga
6256950 apabila boanpwee kalah taysoe boleh berbuat sesuka hati tapi jika secara kebetulan boanpwee menang sejurus atau setengah jurus maka boanpwee hanya berharap supaya siauw lim pay mundur dari kong beng teng
6256951 aku hanya bicara secara pribadi aku tak percaya liong jiauw chioe tak bisa membereskan kau
6256952 liong jiauw chioe dari siauw lim pay memang tiada cacatnya
6256953 ilmu itu adalah kim na chioe hoat ilmu mencengkram yang tiada duanya dalam dunia hanya sayang latihan taysoe belum sempurna
6256954 jika kau dapat memecahkan liong jiauw chioe ku aku akan segera pulang ke siauw lim sie dan seumur hidup aku tidak akan keluar dari pintu kuil lagi
6256955 tapi kau jangan harap bisa menandingi aku dalam suatu pertempuran yang sungguh sungguh
6256956 jika boanpwee mundur setengah langkah saja boanpwee sudah boleh dihitung kalah
6256957 yang menang biarlah menang secara adil yang kalah biarlah kalah dengan tidak merasa penasaran
6256958 belum tentu liong jiauw chioe hanya dimiliki oleh siauw lim pay
6256959 dengan menggunakan liong jiauw chioe dari siauw lim pay boanpwee telah mengalahkan taysoe
6256960 kerugian apakah yang diderita oleh siauw lim pay jika boanpwee tidak menggunakan liong jiauw chioe ilmu dari siauw lim pay sendiri dalam dunia yang lebar ini tidak ada ilmu lain yang akan dapat menjatuhkan taysoe
6256961 can sie coe mempunyai budi yang sangat tinggi loo lap merasa berterima kasih dan takluk
6256962 boanpwee berharap supaya taysoe suka mengampuni segala kekurang ajaran boanpwee
6256963 waktu digunakan oleh sie coe liong jiauw chioe dahsyat luar biasa
6256964 loo lap belum pernah bermimpi bahwa ilmu silat itu sedemikian hebatnya jika di lain hari nanti sie coe mempunyai waktu luang loo lap harap sie coe suka mampir di kuil kami loo lap ingin menjadi tuan rumah dan meminta pengajaran dari sie coe
6256965 dia bernama sian ie thong cian boen jin hwa san pay ilmu silat tidak tinggi tapi banyak akal bulusnya
6256966 kau sudah mengalahkan tetua dari khong tong pay dan bahkan siauw lim seng ceng pun jatuh di bawah angin aku sungguh merasa sangat kagum tapi apakah aku boleh mengetahui cianpwee manakah yang mempunyai seorang murid begitu gagah seperti can siauw hiap
6256967 orang jaman dulu sering berkata begini kian hian soe cee
6256968 aku pernah menolong seseorang yang mendapat tujuh belas lubang luka bacokan ia sebenarnya sudah mesti mati tiga hari tiga malam aku tidak tidur dan dengan segenap kepandaian aku bisa menyembuhkannya belakangan aku mengangkat saudara dengannya tak disangka ia akhirnya membinasakan adik perempuanku adik kandungku
6256969 di badanku tidak ada 17 luka dan akupun belum pernah mencelakai jiwa adik angkatku aku tak punya rahasia apapun jua yang harus disembunyikan
6256970 kalau can siauw hiap tidak sudi memberitahukan nama gurumu maka aku mengambil keberanian untuk meminta pengajaran dengan menggunakan ilmu silat hwa san pay yang sangat cetek
6256971 sedang kong seng ceng saja masih belum dapat menandingi can siauw hiap maka ilmu silatku tentu tidak masuk hitungan biarlah pertandingan ini dibatasi sampai salah satu pihak ada yang kena sentuh aku mengharap dalam pertempuran can siauw hiap suka menaruh belas kasihan
6256972 ilmu silat hwa san pay sangat tinggi dan tidak perlu meminta pelajaran dari orang luar yang menjadi soal adalah ilmu sian ie ciang boen sendiri yang sukar dicari duanya dalam dunia ini ilmu itu bernama ilmu melupakan budi ilmu membalas kebaikan dengan kejahatan
6256973 sian ie ciang boen ada satu hal yang kurang dimengerti olehku dan aku ingin meminta penjelasan dulu kau mendapat tujuh belas luka dan keadaanmu lebih baik mati daripada hidup ada orang yang tanpa tidur tiga hari tiga malam sudah menolongmu dan mengobati kau hingga kau sembuh ia mengangkat saudara denganmu dan memperlakukanmu seperti saudara kandungnya sendiri tapi mengapa kau begitu jahat sehingga kau membinasakan adik perempuan orang itu

6257039 striking how unqualified obama is and how this whole thing came about within the democrat party i think it really goes back to the fact that nobody had the guts to stand up and say no to a black guy
6257040 playing a young janitor and mathematics genius with personality problems he and his friend
6257041 its easy to be distracted and not paying attention to signs
6257042 what we want is compliance its not about revenue its about getting people to stop for red lights
6257043 its alerting you to upcoming danger areas so its a win win for us as well as the police department
6257044 we reached an agreement final decision with respect to moving ahead has not been made yet but we have an agreement with the umpires
6257045 radio show and made it clear that she found idea of dating the golden boy repulsive
6257046 everyone was making it out to be such a big deal that i think we both fell prey to having that affect us
6257047 i think it will be ok were both grown women both professionals once we were working it felt like a good fit
6257048 we rethought those plans and came up with a way to put a lid on the cells instead of the razor wire
6257049 the important thing is this has to function as a normal jail
6257050 the nature of jail is to create an environment where you can maintain security and order and one of our primary charges is the care and custody of inmates
6257051 style experience im still loving the use of waggle to throttle your minions thats the kind of motion control i can fully support the story also seems to be in keeping with the series tongue in cheek humor with a slightly adorable side to the overlords backstory
6257052 yeah it is and parts of it is being extremely frustrating and parts of its been sort of good i enjoyed the summer but certainly my heart is wanting to be in the indycar and its certainly its been tough when you switch on the tv and you see the cars going around
6257053 like i said its been tough i knew it was going to be tough before and i made those sacrifices when i put my name on the contract to know there was going to be a good future with this team and certainly moving forward
6257054 it was certainly different certainly theres no room for error there because your braking has to be perfect and if it is a little bit late you get lock up and you almost miss the corner completely
6257055 five games and they didnt even kick him out of the game wow
6257056 the umpires dont kick him out but the league suspends him thats a first isnt it i havent seen that
6257057 my intent was to make the opposing pitcher feel as uncomfortable as i did the at bat before
6257058 the way the league interpreted it it seems like they feel i was trying to hit him
6257059 i dont know if he really tried to hit me
6257060 maybe he was trying to take me out of the game a little bit and mess with my concentration on the game
6257061 if im going to hit somebody itd be position players in that situation that wasnt on purpose i had two men on base and two outs if i hit him i have to face the no 9 batter i just tried to throw inside and the ball went up close to him i think he got ticked off thats part of the game
6257062 i hadnt had my rhythm for about a year and a half after back surgery for a herniated disk in april 2007 i just havent been able to find my swing in the last month ive felt really close to where i need to be and where i was in 2006
6257063 the injury was nothing that i was really worried about
6257064 i just didnt have rhythm at the plate my backs been fine all year except for that one stint where it locked up for four or five days in a row and i ended up going on the dl
6257065 it takes a lot of mental focus youre just constantly concentrating on keeping a good swing
6257066 you want your swing to be as perfect as possible when you go into a situation like that thats one thing that johnson does well id say him and mike fontenot are two guys that ive really talked to on the bench and made sure that theyre at least mentally ready
6257067 reed has been in the league a little while now so he doesnt have to ask as many questions like fontenot would
6257068 johnson helps me out just as much as i help him out we watch each others swings and we make sure that were as close as possible to being like an everyday guy
6257069 now its just a matter of me getting in a cage and trying to find my swing and trying to find my rhythm
6257070 we need to see a lot of things one of those is how hes doing also he threw 44 pitches today on the side and did well he will throw another side on saturday then that kind of hopefully puts him in line to us thinking about starting him in a game thats kind of where were at with the days off with beckett we have some ability to maneuver this and manipulate it a little bit well just kind of take stock on where everybody is and plug them in
6257071 everything felt good im going to throw another side on saturday and see how it feels and go from there
6257072 last year was a situation where we were in the middle of a pennant race not that were not in the middle of one now but we didnt have a whole lot of options
6257073 i had to pitch and i tried to grit my teeth until i couldnt go anymore it got so bad the rest that was needed was longer than expected

6257081 i believe that bin laden has been able to get into the good graces of omar who is very poorly educated and unsure of foreign affairs and to influence him in his way of thinking
6257082 the potential ramifications of a who is drifting toward pan islamism are grim first and foremost it could mean that the taliban would under no condition expel bin laden because they see his cause as theirs
6257083 time for a diplomatic solution may be running out taliban brush off of our indictment and other evidence may indicate movement from tolerance

6257085 i just blew my mind and blew the worlds mind
6257086 ive been dreaming of this since i was yea high
6257087 so it means a lot more to me actually than the 100 means
6257088 hes just blessed with an uncanny frame an uncanny quickness a huge competitive heart and he is having a good time which i think our sport sorely needs to see
6257089 he got an incredible start guys of 6 5 should not be able to start like that its that long massive stride hes eating up so much more track than others he came in focused knowing he would likely win the gold and hes got the record
6257090 youre back there giving it everything youve got its brutal
6257091 hes doing it and making it look so simple did it and it didnt look that easy
6257092 im on the track hes in the water we cant compare too much hes the best in what he do
6257093 i honor his service i dont honor his policies i dont honor his politics
6257094 celebrities like to spend their millions barack obama is no different only its your money he wants to spend
6257095 i have never suggested that picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
6257096 the bottom line is that sen obamas words for all their eloquence and passion dont mean all that much
6257097 because i am a woman i must make unusual efforts to

6257133 era in grado di fare balzi di sei metri nellaria fino allaltezza vertiginosa delle cime degli alberi e afferrare con la massima precisione e senza alcun urto visibile i rami che fluttuavano selvaggiamente incontro a un tornado in arrivo
6257134 pocas personas de nuestra generaci n han encarnado con tanta transparencia el rostro manso y humilde de jesucristo
6257135 el hermano roger ha seguido el camino del cordero con su dulzura y su humildad con su rechazo de todo acto de grandeza con su decisi n de no hablar mal de nadie con su deseo de llevar en su coraz n los dolores y las esperanzas de la humanidad
6257136 en una poca turbulenta para la iglesia y para la fe cristiana el hermano roger era una fuente de esperanza reconocida por muchos incluido yo mismo ve a c mo aquella estancia les ayudaba a conocer mejor y a vivir la palabra de dios en la alegr a y la simplicidad
6257137 m s que a la rapidez del desarrollo del movimiento ecum nico l miraba a su profundidad
6257138 estaba convencido de que s lo un ecumenismo nutrido de la palabra de dios y de la celebraci n de la eucarist a de la oraci n y de la contemplaci n ser a capaz de reunir a los cristianos en la unidad querida por jes s
6257139 como un hilo conductor incluso en las decisiones m s concretas de cada d a acogiendo alegremente cada acci n que pueda acercar a los cristianos de tradiciones diferentes evitando toda palabra o gesto que pudiera retrasar su reconciliaci n
6257140 para m explic el purpurado el hecho de que cada a o miles de j venes sigan tomando el camino de la peque a colina de taiz es verdaderamente un don del esp ritu santo para la iglesia hoy
6257141 estoy contento de ver que los j venes que plantan cada verano las tiendas de taiz procedentes de diversos pa ses de europa occidental y oriental pertenecen a comunidades de tradici n protestante cat lica y ortodoxa y que a menudo acuden acompa ados por sus sacerdotes o pastores
6257142 como una par bola de la unidad que ayuda a superar las fracturas del pasado creo que muchos j venes se dan cuenta de lo que se juega con la unidad de los cristianos saben c mo el peso de las divisiones dificulta el testimonio de los cristianos y la construcci n de una nueva sociedad
6257143 encuentran dificultades para acompa ar bien a los j venes en su camino espiritual y en este sentido los grandes encuentros de taiz responden a una verdadera necesidad pastoral
6257144 gran continuidad en la vida de la comunidad de taiz y en la acogida a los j venes
6257145 la liturgia la oraci n y la hospitalidad contin an con el mismo esp ritu como un canto que nunca se ha interrumpido esto dice mucho no s lo sobre la persona del nuevo prior sino tambi n sobre la madurez humana y espiritual de toda la comunidad de taiz es la comunidad en su conjunto la que ha heredado el carisma del hermano roger y del cual continua a vivir e irradiar
6257146 ya desde joven nutri su fe y su vida espiritual en las fuentes de otras tradiciones cristianas traspasando as ciertos l mites confesionales su deseo de seguir una vocaci n mon stica y con esta intenci n de fundar una nueva comunidad con cristianos reformados dice mucho sobre esta b squeda
6257147 la fe del prior de taiz se enriqueci con el patrimonio de la fe de la iglesia cat lica
6257148 recibi en muchas ocasiones la comuni n de manos de juan pablo ii que ten a lazos de amistad con l desde los tiempos del concilio vaticano ii y que conoc a bien su camino en la fe cat lica en este sentido no hab a nada de secreto o de escondido en la postura de la iglesia cat lica ni en taiz ni en roma
6257149 reconciliando en s mismo la fe de sus or genes con el misterio de la fe cat lica sin romper la comuni n con nadie
6257150 en su conciencia l hab a entrado en el misterio de la fe cat lica como uno que crece sin tener que abandonar o romper con lo que hab a recibido o vivido antes
6257151 por respeto al camino de fe del prior de taiz ser a preferible no aplicar en su caso categor as que l juzgaba inapropiadas para su experiencia y que por otro lado la iglesia cat lica nunca quiso imponerle
6257152 por una parte el prior de taiz se sent a muy cercano a los obispos de roma en su preocupaci n de conducir a la iglesia de cristo en el camino de la renovaci n espiritual de la unidad de los cristianos del servicio a los pobres y del testimonio del evangelio
6257153 se sab a profundamente comprendido y apoyado por los papas en su personal camino espiritual y en la orientaci n que iba tomando la joven comunidad de taiz
6257154 la conciencia de actuar en armon a con el pensamiento del obispo de roma era para l como una br jula en todos sus actos l nunca habr a tomado una iniciativa que supiera que iba contra el parecer o la voluntad del papa

6257159 lord i call to you listen to me when i call to you

6257162 then may i always remember where the true miracle occurs on the inside amen and has been challenged by ankylosing spondylistis celiac sprue atrial fibrillation and other chronic conditions
6257163 i find it disturbing if you have two people who are mentally retarded living together its like having two blind people living together how is one going to show the other how to maneuver
6257164 it still should be some rules and regulation to mentally retarded people living in a home together
6257165 being someone who moved into a home that two mentally retarded people lived in it does nothing to the property value of your home and does nothing to your neighborhood they are loving people and should be treated as such
6257166 they are just a little slow they dont walk the streets or play loud music i dont understand what the problem is
6257167 these people dont have the mental capacity to operate in an everyday environment there could be some problems its been known that they wander off we dont know what the situation could come about we need to make sure we are doing what we can to hinder that for both parties for their well being and the people in the community
6257168 we are living in the year 2008 and we need to make accommodations for people who are the most discriminated against group people with disabilities

6257172 satellite radio for example charging a subscription makes about 118 per year per consumer over the air radio they generate about 80 per year per consumer pandora by their own testimony last year at a hearing its generating about 1 70 per listener per year there are no ads how are they generating money
6257173 it is their fault but on the flip side the reason why its their fault theyre not making as much as terrestrial radio
6257174 theyre not buying into the sleaze that terrestrial radio does and its very much the same kind of problem that an independent band faces when it needs to either do something that would potentially involve selling out or not being able to make music anymore
6257175 you have to take into account the audience size and you have to take into account customizability
6257176 and you have to take into account that you can almost create radio stations on the fly none of those things have been taken into account
6257177 im well aware that the numbers were talking about here are very substantial

6257181 the evidence is uncontroverted that the drawings portray older edgier sexier dolls
6257182 the eyebrows were way too aggressive the lips way too pronounced the face way too harsh what mga made is a prettier doll that could compete

6257306 i stephanie tubbs jones a representative from ohio and ms boxer a senator from california object to the counting of the electoral votes of the state of ohio on the ground that they were not under all of the known circumstances regularly given
6257307 while some have called our cause foolish i can assure you that my parents mary and andrew tubbs did not raise any fools and as a lawyer former judge and prosecutor i am duty bound to follow the law and apply the law to the facts as i find them
6257308 it is on behalf of those millions of americans who believe in and value our democratic process and the right to vote that i put forth this objection today
6257309 this objection does not have at its root the hope or even the hint of overturning or challenging the victory of the president but it is a necessary timely and appropriate opportunity to review and remedy the most precious process in our democracy
6257310 i raise this objection neither to put the nation in the turmoil of a proposed overturned election nor to provide cannon fodder or partisan demagoguery for my fellow republican members of congress
6257311 i raise this objection because i am convinced that we as a body must conduct a formal and legitimate debate about election irregularities i raise this objection to debate the process and protect the integrity of the true will of the people
6257312 again i thank senator boxer for joining me in this objection to the counting of ohios electoral votes due to the considerable number of voting irregularities that transpired in my home state

6257361 tetanus toxoid is of no value unless the individual has previously been vaccinated since a primary antibody response takes at least 14 days and the incubation period of the disease can be considerably shorter than this three to 14 days if you do decide to vaccinate your children with tetanus toxoid alone there is no need to vaccinate until the child is old enough to walk around and navigate on his or her own 18 to 24 months at which time the vaccine is far less likely to cause complications
6257362 the incubation period for tetanus varies from 3 to 21 days usually about 8

6257399 right through the motivational campaign theme they were doing everything right
6257400 the stature gap between obama and mccain widened dramatically in the mind of any viewer who watched
6257401 the political mind why you cant understand 21st century american politics with an 18th century brain
6257402 the nature of the campaign is changing less than a week before the convention starts
6257403 obama felt he was sitting with dr phil and he was trying not to offend anybody mccain seemed to understand he was running for president his answers were more direct and aimed at the electorate
6257404 the primaries are pre season you can make mistakes but now were into the first game that really counts
6257405 obamas folks are reading their own press clippings too much and theyve got to understand theyre in a dogfight
6257406 the party is very bad at labeling things that provide an umbrella for other positive memories
6257407 what were seeing now is a clear regrouping and also again some kind of deception campaign saying look were moving out
6257408 they are going around now and trying to grab new strategic areas in georgia
6257409 we still believe this is not all that this is just a beginning
6257410 dreaming to turn my country into chechnya into some kind of insurgency warfare field where they go around and operate with brutal force
6257411 the last thing im worried about is about my political future right now

6257414 there are doping speculations against anybody who runs or jumps so well
6257415 its natural if youre faster than me were going to suspect youre cheating if your stronger faster better everybody is speculating
6257416 youre back there giving it everything youve got its brutal
6257417 hes doing it and making it look so simple michael johnson did it and it didnt look that easy
6257418 in order to run 19 30 he has to run the curve better and hold his speed for longer i didnt think he would run 9 69 in the 100 but i think he could have run 9 62 if he had run to the finish and tied up his shoes
6257419 i knew the track was fast but i did not think this was possible
6257420 im shocked i have been aspiring to the world record for so long

6257433 obamas support among voters between the ages of 18 and 29 which had been one of his strengths slipped 12 percentage points to 52 percent mccain who will turn 72 next week was winning 40 percent of younger voters

6257437 hes been performing consistently over the years back home and on india a tours

6257440 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6257441 that hairline difference between nuance and what appears to be flip flopping is hurting him with liberal voters
6257442 conservatives were supposed to be the bigger problem for mccain
6257443 obama still has work to do on his base at this point mccain seems to be doing a better job with his
6257444 there were no wild swings there isnt one group that is radically different than last month or even two months ago it was just a steady decline for obama across the board

6257450 but dont you dare suggest i am less patriotic than you or i have political motivations in taking the positions i take
6257451 im skinny but im tough we will hit back hard with the truth we will answer any lies that are made and we intend to win this election
6257452 we cant have the same kind of shoot first and aim second approach in our foreign policy weve got to have some kind of judgment in our foreign policy and restore our alliances around the world
6257453 tendency is to shoot first and to ask questions later
6257454 cheer led president george w bushs decision to take our eye off the ball and start a
6257455 this is a record that belies anything approaching sound judgment
6257456 he has consistently been quick draw mccain here on every issue his first instinct is to rattle sabers and look for a military solution
6257457 let me be very clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgment senator obama has made it clear he values withdrawal from iraq above victory in iraq
6257458 he has made these decisions not because he doesnt love america but because he doesnt think it matters whether america wins or loses
6257459 i think he would do for foreign policy experience a long and distinguished senate resume and he is one of the most effective surrogates that senator obama has right now who can go toe to toe with any republican on any issue at any time
6257460 not something that lends itself to on the job training
6257461 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean
6257462 i made it clear to him and everybody else i never worked for anybody in my life
6257463 i got here when i was 29 i never had a boss i dont know how id handle it
6257464 we rethought those plans and came up with a way to put a lid on the cells instead of the razor wire
6257465 the important thing is this has to function as a normal jail
6257466 the nature of jail is to create an environment where you can maintain security and order and one of our primary charges is the care and custody of inmates
6257467 theres already been things out there in the media hes already made up his mind hes going to announce on such and such a day
6257468 i have not made the decision and were in the process and if i say anything more than that i guarantee you theres going to be another one of these firestorms obviously were going to be announcing soon because we have no choice but ive got to tell you its one of the toughest things ive ever done
6257469 i think he knows how to reach across party lines the same way massachusetts gov mitt romney former budget director rob portman and ridge a new reuters zogby poll gave mccain a 5 point national lead over obama wiping out the s 7 point advantage in july and giving mccain his first lead in the reuters zogby poll and one of his few leads in any poll two other polls showed the race tightening with a wall street journal nbc news poll giving obama a 3 point edge down from 6 points last month and a cbs new york times poll also giving obama a 3 point edge down from 6 points two weeks ago mccain has been gaining on obama in polls over the last few weeks after repeatedly criticizing the democrats experience opposition to most new and credentials as a commander in chief he renewed his attacks on obama for supporting a 16 month timetable to withdraw combat troops from iraq and criticized obamas suggestion he had questioned obamas patriotism got a little testy on this issue he said im questioning his patriotism
6257470 let me be very clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgment
6257471 one of the least experienced candidates for president in the last 100 years
6257472 i dont honor his policies i dont honor his politics
6257473 theyll say hes young hes got a funny name hes not patriotic
6257474 s own campaign is the only one talking about his patriotism
6257475 we should be using some of that money to rebuild virginia laying roads building broadband lines and putting people back to work
6257476 we sure as heck dont have to give them incentives to move we should give companies tax breaks that are right here
6257477 if you give me that opportunity if you give me that chance i will fight for you every single day
6257478 let me be very clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgment senator obama has made it clear he values withdrawal from iraq above victory in iraq
6257479 he has made these decisions not because he doesnt love america but because he doesnt think it matters whether america wins or loses
6257480 sue a tanto como puedas so ar y cualquier cosa ser posible
6257481 matt and lucy damon had a baby girl named gia zavala on wednesday aug 20th everyones doing great she is a healthy baby girl
6257482 he will report to dr william duncan the vas associate deputy under secretary for health for quality and safety
6257483 dr almenoffs new position is not a promotion from his previous position as network director for vlsn 15 where he managed an operating budget of approximately 1 2 billion annually
6257484 in his new position he will have no direct authority to independently hire or fire or manage budgets his supervisory responsibilities will be significantly reduced from what they were previously
6257485 he is recognized nationwide as a leading authority in measuring the efficiency and effectiveness of care provided in intensive care settings and is widely known for his ability to find ways to quantifiably measure health care quality
6257486 an administrative board of investigation charged with reviewing events at that facility in 2007 also examined dr almenoffs role and did not find him culpable
6257487 his supervisory responsibilities are being significantly reduced from what they were previously and he will not have direct authority to hire or fire employees or manage budgets
6257488 we will continue to monitor the progress at marion vmac and when red flags like this are raised in the future we will not hesitate to ask the necessary questions to see that our veterans are receiving the care they deserve
6257489 questionable track record of ensuring quality and safety at a va medical care facility in illinois
6257490 we are not aware of any efforts by the network to fix these problems in the months before the spike in mortality levels
6257491 indeed the departments reviews identified certain deficiencies with the network led by dr almenoff
6257492 we are not pulling out and pulling back troops behind this administrative border into the territory of south ossetia
6257493 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
6257494 its clear to us and the american leadership doesnt deny it that the so called missile shield in europe will be widened and modernised in that case russia will be compelled to react and not only by diplomatic protests
6257495 ever clearer attempts to change the strategic balance of forces in its favour and hinder stability and predictability in world affairs
6257496 such a battery can have nothing to do with parrying imaginary iranian threats
6257497 the surplus that the rudd government put together is very important
6257498 its a buffer against international economic uncertainty and for the liberal party to try to blow a hole in that surplus is the height of economic irresponsibility
6257499 el show de los sue os sangre de mi sangre
6257500 and i think theres a kind of moral challenge there for people like the motoring associations to work with their members to increase occupancy
6257501 todas sabemos que la experiencia de amamantar puede ser un duro camino y venirse abajo pero si al final tenemos xito este es un logro importante para compartirlo
6257502 as of summer 2007 savings were a negative 1 3 percent an all time low

6257504 there are more hockey fans in d c than there are capitals fans
6257505 i root for the caps but im a bruins fan first and foremost
6257506 the fiscal ramifications in the argument against contraction appear to make the argument for expansion
6257507 defendant intended for customers to believe its statements and representations about the defective iphone 3gs and to trust that the device was twice as fast at half the price
6257508 immediately after purchase plaintiff soon noticed that her internet connection receipt and sending of e mail text messages and other data transfers were slower than expected and advertised
6257509 the defective iphone 3g appeared to connect to the 3g standard and protocol less than 25 of the time additionally plaintiff experienced an inordinate amount of dropped calls
6257510 defendant expressly warranted that the defective iphone 3g would be twice as fast and would otherwise perform adequately on the 3g standard or protocol
6257511 the defective iphone 3gs do not conform to these express representations because they fail to connect and or adequately maintain a connection to the 3g standard and or protocol
6257512 the proposed class contains thousands and perhaps tens of thousands of members
6257513 the way its done the way its financed the way its budgeted
6257514 its sad from a purist standpoint because it was always who had the best training now its not all about that now its training and fit and theres more money involved
6257515 its the difference between someone running the 100 meter dash with spikes on and someone running it barefoot
6257516 the sad thing is phelps was set to take a run at all these world records without the technology
6257517 now its going to be with this and its just kind of tainted what he was ready to do i think
6257518 we post shows on a monthly basis so there was no way to warn people or change what the website or tv guides said
6257519 if you want to pursue me after you get back you can the doors open
6257520 the mccain campaign believes that some of hillary clintons tactics especially questioning whether obama is ready to lead can be a real winner
6257521 the mccain team has been very open that they went to school on the hillary clinton campaign that they learned from that
6257522 and on this 3 a m ad whats very striking as some have pointed out over the last few days is that barack obama was winning a steady streak of victories against hillary clinton
6257523 and then she ran that ad and she really went on the attack on the experience question and she won the bulk of the primaries thereafter in the closing months of the democratic primaries and won 500 000 more votes than he did and almost took it away from him
6257524 which candidate do voters believe is better qualified to deal with russia mccain by better than 2 1
6257525 going after more centrist voters more swing voters more conservative voters who will be a much bigger deal in the general election than they were in those primaries and caucuses
6257526 not only did the clinton campaign give mccain and his advisers a road map but they actually started the mccains down that path
6257527 thats why youre hearing from obama very specific policy oriented proposals here
6257528 theres not a lot of that kind of flash if you will from the earlier days
6257529 the big question now is whether obama can successfully regain control of the campaign agenda as we head into the democratic convention
6257530 what the clinton campaign demonstrated is when you bring obama back down to earth its a better battle
6257531 if one of senator obamas advisers has been to damascus we just wonder how many have been to tehran
6257532 pada selasa 19 agustus penahanan habib rizieq di rutan polda metro sudah habis tetapi oleh kejaksaan belum diberi surat perpanjangan penahanan sehingga pada rabu 20 agustus pukul 00 00 malam sampai 12 00 siang itu penahanannya tidak jelas
6257533 i believe that bin laden has been able to get into the good graces of omar who is very poorly educated and unsure of foreign affairs and to influence him in his way of thinking
6257534 the potential ramifications of a mullah omar who is drifting toward pan islamism are grim first and foremost it could mean that the taliban would under no condition expel bin laden because they see his cause as theirs
6257535 time for a diplomatic solution may be running out taliban brush off of our indictment and other evidence may indicate movement from tolerance
6257536 i told you i could make it without you you have no place in my life anymore im without a love without one of those tall handsome men that i thought would bring me happiness but in the arms of my father and i can tell you now id rather have the latter
6257537 we decided to do a cover on this disc and we didnt want to do what every other band is doing these days and take a pop or rock song from the 80s
6257538 we figured a song by a band with real metal cred would do best for us

6257550 behold in this thou art not just i will answer thee that god is greater than man why dost thou strive against him for he giveth not account of any of his matters for god speaketh once yea twice yet man perceiveth it not in a dream in a vision of the night when deep sleep falleth upon men in slumberings upon the bed then he openeth the ears of men and sealeth their instruction that he may withdraw man from his purpose and hide pride from man
6257551 then he is gracious unto him and saith deliver him from going down to the pit i have found a ransom his flesh shall be fresher than a childs he shall return to the days of his youth he shall pray unto god and he will be favourable unto him and he shall see his face with joy for he will render unto man his righteousness he looketh upon men and if any say i have sinned and perverted that which was right and it profited me not he will deliver his soul from going into the pit and his life shall see the light lo all these things worketh god oftentimes with man to bring back his soul from the pit to be enlightened with the light of the living
6257552 and this is the record that god hath given to us eternal life and this life is in his son he that hath the son hath life and he that hath not the son of god hath not life these things have i written unto you that believe on the name of the son of god that ye may know that ye have eternal life and that ye may believe on the name of the son of god
6257553 and i brethren could not speak unto you as unto spiritual but as unto carnal even as unto babes in christ i have fed you with milk and not with meat for hitherto ye were not able to bear it neither yet now are ye able
6257554 lord youre all i have and youre all i need
6257555 a house isnt a home without the heart of the homemaker being right with god
6257556 for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church
6257557 wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the lord
6257558 to yield resign or surrender to the power will or authority of another
6257559 im sorry my husband said he didnt think i should be taking any more on right now
6257560 the heart of her husband doth safely trust in her so that he shall have no need of spoil she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life
6257561 let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence and likewise also the wife unto the husband
6257562 but i would have you without carefulness he that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the lord how he may please the lord but he that is married careth for the things that are of the world how he may please his wife there is a difference also between a wife and a virgin the unmarried woman careth for the things of the lord that she may be holy both in body and in spirit but she that is married careth for the things of the world how she may please her husband
6257563 and these words which i command thee this day shall be in thine heart
6257564 and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house and when thou walkest by the way and when thou liest down and when thou risest up
6257565 a good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh
6257566 that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that god hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation
6257567 the lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is longsuffering to us ward not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance
6257568 o how love i thy law it is my meditation all the day
6257569 for the eyes of the lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him
6257570 not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much the more as ye see the day approaching
6257571 those that be planted in the house of the lord shall flourish in the courts of our god they shall still bring forth fruit in old age they shall be fat and flourishing
6257572 he that walketh with wise men shall be wise but a companion of fools shall be destroyed
6257573 i am a companion of all them that fear thee and of them that keep thy precepts
6257574 show me your friends and ill show you what you are or what you soon shall be
6257575 let no man despise thy youth but be thou an example of the believers in word in conversation in charity in spirit in faith in purity
6257576 a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame
6257577 even a child is known by his doings whether his work be pure and whether it be right
6257578 children obey your parents in the lord for this is right honour thy father and mother which is the first commandment with promise that it may be well with thee and thou mayest live long on the earth
6257579 the eye that mocketh at his father and despiseth to obey his mother the ravens of the valley shall pick it out and the young eagles shall eat it
6257580 the obedience and respect that we are to teach them should not be only toward parents
6257581 yes its another funny but sad coming of age novel by a gorgeous young woman whose photo is prominently displayed on the front cover but guess what this one really is unique and memorable and damn good and would have deserved publication even if the author was a three hundred pound hunchback leper
6257582 i hope there will be 20 more fedexcups for me but ive been looking forward to this ryder cup for a long time
6257583 i might not need to make one more euro but by coming here its in my hands
6257584 its certainly a situation where i would not feel comfortable sitting in the states but i am still in a very comfortable situation the other three are really sweating over it
6257585 it was from 30 feet and i hit it way too hard and three putted
6257586 i was expecting it to be me soren and martin playing together but im really pleased
6257587 i love watching justin swing and we get on well
6257588 what i think is kind of a bummer is if i dont play well these three weeks i wont be in the tour championship
6257589 i mean ive had a great year and i think thats not right i dont think thats fair at all for me to win three times and be kicked out of the tour championship
6257590 but ive kind of been kicked out of all of the tournaments anyway i won the memorial and that didnt get me in the u s open
6257591 it looks to me like what i did this whole year didnt matter and i dont think thats right
6257592 i think there should be some kind of system to where it favors the guy thats had a good year
6257593 i think it should favor the guy who has played well throughout the year but its not going to be in effect this year at all i think youll see somebody come deep and out of the pack that could actually win this thing if i understand it correctly i may not understand it correctly i dont know i really dont understand it anyway
6257594 this is my third pair of contact lenses in my left eye third one of the week and it feels real good and im seeing pretty good out of it
6257595 im excited and it doesnt hurt i dont have any pain my vision is good again
6257596 its a very long golf course its definitely going to be a week
6257597 driving it in the fairway is a premium but the driver is the strength of my game when im on with my driver i dont miss many fairways
6257598 i like westchester i think its a great golf course
6257599 i do feel as though ridgewood is a step up in quality its just a wonderful golf course ive always loved going to westchester but this course really has a major championship feel its a tillinghast same designer as winged foot same designer i believe as baltusrol very similar feel and it has that northeast major championship feel
6257600 the 18th hole doglegs right not left so thats a nice change
6257601 the rough is up and spotty in some spots where its real gnarly and laying all over the place
6257602 its going to be difficult if you hit it in the rough and the greens provide a challenge too because they are pretty severe in some spots and difficult
6257603 you are the one for me im the man for you
6257604 per te ogni cosa che c ninna na ninna e
6257605 potrei stare ore ed ore qui ad accarezzare la tua bocca ed i tuoi zigomi senza mai parlare
6257606 i am still very sad for dropping out of the race and disappointing everyone
6257607 as i have won more and more championships and more and more people have paid attention to me and supported me i have faced more and more pressure and disruptions to my life i cant have happy get togethers with my friends like other people my age and i feel the expectation from the entire country at every moment i know that yesterday everyone was enthusiastically expecting my appearance and i wanted to cross the finish line like ive done so many times before but it really was because of my foot please believe me that the sadness and pain that i feel is no less than yours
6257608 he was carrying the weight of 1 3 billion people
6257609 its hard to clear a hurdle with all that downward pressure
6257610 an official from the state general administration of sport once told us that if liu cannot win a gold medal in beijing all of his previous achievements will become meaningless
6257611 not just for myself but for my country all asia and the yellow skinned people
6257612 people are asking why is he injured athletes should know their bodies
6257613 china is a country run by engineers and the thought is always that outcomes can be predetermined thats not a western belief and its not how the world works but drive outside beijing theres whole cities built out of nothing their sense is that if you want a gold medal you build the right structure and do the training and you can do it and the idea that you can predetermine outcome is being proven here the chinese made the decision that they were going to win 40 gold medals and they did it but not all outcomes can be predetermined with liu xiang the structure didnt work thats why the chinese people are having problems digesting his injury
6257614 the greatest thing youll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return
6257615 i think that the players championship and the fedexcup have enough credibility to offset a season if you were to do well in those events and not win a major
6257616 but still the majors have had that sense of history that is hard to replace in just two years
6257617 but still i think anybody that does well and plays well in the fedexcup and wins the fedexcup i think that would ease anything if they didnt play well in the majors
6257618 we as a family know they are going to be difficult because we play five of them and they are stressful with the ryder cup being a stressful yet fun week and the kids are not with us
6257619 the next few weeks are going to be tough they start school in the middle of this
6257620 but its also the end its the end of the season
6257621 i feel like ive been playing some pretty good golf i havent taken it to that last level of winning but ive been just below
6257622 i mean i could say that im cute but thats really not true i mean my wife thinks that but not many others
6257623 ive always loved playing here and since 2002 at bethpage i had one of the most amazing experiences there and winning the 2005 pga at baltusrol was an incredible experience
6257624 she thinks she is fat and she is always complaining how certain outfits make her bottom look big the script called for her character to be filmed nude in a shower focusing in on her bottom and thighs
6257625 kate just didnt want to show her bottom even though everyone on the set was saying how good it looks in jeans she said she couldnt face the thought of seeing her butt up on a big screen kate insisted on a double being hired she was quite open on the set about not liking her body and said she particularly loathed her bottom and was not comfortable baring it
6257626 when i was shooting a movie once the faxes went out from the producers and the director to my agents to my manager to call me and ask me to lose weight
6257627 i just remember sitting in my trailer hysterically crying from the embarrassment i felt about myself my body and that no one could talk to me directly
6257628 im an indulger but then i have to be good when im in really good shape i like my butt its juicy
6257629 ive got to play well to have a chance of a wild card
6257630 im doing everything i can but whoever nick picks im sure it will be the best team
6257631 if i dont play well these two weeks id have no complaints if i dont get picked it would be totally acceptable
6257632 the first tee of a ryder cup is not the place to be if youre not firing on all cylinders
6257633 i actually played okay there id be the first to say so if i was terrible but i wasnt
6257634 we are a small rural district in the bible belt with strong christian beliefs and feel like homosexuality is wrong
6257635 i dont think we are that different from a lot of districts at least in the panhandle that have beliefs that maybe are different from societal changes
6257636 davis embarked on what can only be characterized as a witch hunt to identify students who were homosexual and their supporters further adding fuel to the fire
6257637 he went so far as to lift the shirts of female students to insure the letters gp or the words gay pride were not written on their bodies
6257638 i just felt like i had to stand up for the kids heather wanted to do this and i had to back her
6257639 i think a shirt that says i support gays is very different from a shirt that says gays are going to hell
6257640 one can be very disruptive for a childs self esteem the other supports other people and their ideas
6257641 what happens when these kids get out in the real world after they leave ponce de leon and they have a black homosexual supervisor at their job
6257642 i emphasize that daviss personal and religious views about homosexuality are not issues in this case indeed daviss opinions and views are consistent with the beliefs of many in holmes county in florida and in the country
6257643 where davis went wrong was when he endeavored to silence the opinions of his dissenters
6257644 david davis is a fine man and good principal and we are a gentle peaceful christian family oriented community
6257645 but i think thats less of an issue here than in miami or minnesota

6257647 the improved security in iraq allows us to have conversations with the iraqis about setting goals for more american troops to come home and for the iraqis to take the lead in more combat missions
6257648 any dates in an agreement will be based on conditions on the ground because we do not want to lose the hard fought gains of the surge
6257649 we have given ours the other side has given theirs
6257650 i believe that bin laden has been able to get into the good graces of omar who is very poorly educated and unsure of foreign affairs and to influence him in his way of thinking
6257651 the potential ramifications of a mullah omar who is drifting toward pan islamism are grim first and foremost it could mean that the taliban would under no condition expel bin laden because they see his cause as theirs
6257652 time for a diplomatic solution may be running out taliban brush off of our indictment and other evidence may indicate movement from tolerance

6257654 the strongest player in matches defeating a player of his class and style is a challenge that few could at present meet the qualities needed to win a tournament would not apply to the requirements for winning a match
6257655 its also the case that when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6257656 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6257657 in this case russia will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic
6257658 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6257659 after what happened in georgia i believe that this is good protection for us
6257660 made the americans agree to this deal sooner because the russians are getting too bossy
6257661 will help both the alliance and poland and the united states respond to the coming threats
6257662 in troubled times the most important thing is to have friends
6257663 but it is more important to have friends who share your values and your aspirations and your dreams and poland and the united states are those kind of friends
6257664 by definition anything from cook is pretty rare and pretty magical
6257665 there are incredibly few things which is why this auction is so exciting and also because its a boomerang which is such an iconic thing
6257666 there are plenty of cook collectors and i would think some australian institutions would be interested
6257667 while we continue to see volatility in international markets and increases in the average cost of long term funding we have experienced some short term funding relief which we are keen to pass on to our customers
6257668 while i am pleased to make todays undertaking our medium and long term funding and our retail deposit base represent the greatest proportion of our funding costs and the average cost of these sources of funding continue to increase
6257669 the recent fall in short term funding costs provides an opportunity to undertake to move rates in line with the rba decision but future interest rate decisions will need to reflect an assessment of all the cost of funding factors
6257670 all australian banks are reliant on offshore funding and increases in the average cost of long term funding are likely to be with us for some time
6257671 this piece is not only well researched and well written it is strangely how should i phrase it
6257672 ma impossibile se io ce ne metto 14 tu non ce la fai in 13
6257673 ti dico di si e i 400m li faccio in non pi di un minuto
6257674 allora si comincia quando entri in bagno al primo colpo di sciacquone fermo il cronometro le scrollatine vanno date rigorosamente prima e non meno di tre carta igienica con massimo 3 veli
6257675 if the reserve bank of australia rba reduces the official cash rate by 0 25 per cent at its september board meeting nab will reduce its standard variable interest rate by 0 25 per cent to 9 36 per cent per annum
6257676 while we continue to see volatility in international markets and increases in the average cost of long term funding we have experienced some short term funding relief which we are keen to pass on to our customers
6257677 while i am pleased to make todays undertaking our medium and long term funding and our retail deposit base represent the greatest proportion of our funding costs and the average cost of these sources of funding continue to increase
6257678 the recent fall in short term funding costs provides an opportunity to undertake to move rates in line with the rba decision but future interest rate decisions will need to reflect an assessment of all the cost of funding factors
6257679 all australian banks are reliant on offshore funding and increases in the average cost of long term funding are likely to be with us for some time
6257680 therefore any consideration that the federal government can give to enhance the attractiveness of retail bank deposits will help reduce overall funding costs and assist in lowering mortgages rates
6257681 clearly we would love to pass through the full 25 basis points drop if that were to occur but well need to factor in all of those issues at that time
6257682 the thinking is kyle has had 42 starts and we have a good idea of what he is and what hes been
6257683 we need to find out more about troy smith he needs those reps with the starters he needs them against a defense in a third preseason game where theyre game planning him a little bit and well see how he does
6257684 bob was a generous friend and supporter of the school for five decades
6257685 but i think the scholarship was his favorite experience he got to know the recipient of the palmer scholarship each year and he would follow their careers for years
6257686 if you grew up in colorado from the 1960s through the mid 1990s you watched bob palmer
6257687 he was the walter cronkite of denver television a pioneer broadcast journalist whose delivery was unmatchable and whose integrity was unassailable he was a cu buff first and last and he will be greatly missed by coloradans of all ages
6257688 ive been hearing from lots of families that are asking how can i find a loan because theyve been applying to three lenders and theyve been rejected from all three
6257689 many of the lenders that students may have used last year are no longer in the business

6257712 the bible tells of gods creation of heaven earth man and animals not space aliens
6257713 the bible says that god created earth man and animals there was no mention of life on other planets that god created
6257714 there has been no proof only the ramblings of crazy people even if those people saw something from what they say was another world it was probably just a demon
6257715 angels are aliens angels are not of this world and if you believe in angels then you believe in aliens
6257716 the universe is huge who are we to assume that god only created life on our planet why did he create so many other planets in so many other galaxies then
6257717 yes i do believe because my family and i have met some they do not want to hurt us they just want to understand us and help us
6257718 it depends on what you mean by aliens other life or little green guys
6257719 i havent studied the bible enough to know whether or not god made life elsewhere
6257720 to begin with you are devastated because you only know that the person was on the plane you dont know if they are alright if they are among the dead you feel totally powerless said ricardo whose brother in law was among the survivors
6257721 it was very hard to arrive at the scene of the accident we have saved those we could said miguel angel sanchez who was in charge of the fire service operation
6257722 we have set up several special rooms in the airport to look after the families psychologist juan antonio carujo said on cadena ser radio
6257723 i guess i should warn you if i turn out to be particularly clear youve probably misunderstood what i said
6257724 i dont really care if my glass is 1 2 full or 1 2 empty im just happy i have a glass
6257725 i think we are ready for the world cup qualifiers
6257726 i think we did well in the first half and put petr cech under a lot of pressure he was their best player and made three good saves
6257727 the czechs are a very good team which is why i wanted to play them they are not easy to beat
6257728 but we created chances especially in the first half and played well but we suffered when they counter attacked and this is a problem we must work on
6257729 i can see progression i think we are moving forward
6257730 we started the match with the idea of surviving which we managed we were attacking well from the breaks
6257731 maybe if we had started the second half 1 0 up it would have been better for us but although it shook us marek jankulovsvky scored a beautiful goal from his free kick
6257732 we controlled the game for most of the second half and they did not have too many scoring chances but england are a very strong team who played right to the end and it was a shame we conceded such a late goal
6257733 if you have a luggage rack with metal racks put your suitcase on that
6257734 at that point when you go home all laundry goes into a trash bag outside and then right into a washing machine on a hot cycle and then a clothes dryer
6257735 as little as five or 10 minutes kills everything on high heat cold will not kill the eggs and not all the adults
6257736 find a good pest control company this is not one where you buy bug spray and battle it yourself
6257737 theyre finding these things in public transit in movie theaters in cruise ships in all the hospitality accommodations
6257738 when we get a report we get the pest control staff and we respond these bugs can take over quickly
6257739 i will help keep confronting her on her childish narcissistic behavior until i get bored
6257740 i will help keep confronting her on her childish narcissistic behavior until i get bored
6257741 from the day schumers letter was made public on june 26 until the closure of the bank a run on the bank took place and the failure became inevitable
6257742 by definition anything from cook is pretty rare and pretty magical
6257743 there are incredibly few things which is why this auction is so exciting and also because its a boomerang which is such an iconic thing
6257744 there are plenty of cook collectors and i would think some australian institutions would be interested
6257745 dr ben cunneen hes been a very valuable employee with us for quite a long time dr lovell said on abc radio
6257746 he was the first person who became infected in this outbreak and hes been very very seriously ill in hospital
6257747 i just spare a thought for them for the last five weeks i guess it is theyve virtually had to maintain a vigil with him against overwhelming odds of any chance of success it is terrible
6257748 its just terrible theyre very very upset dr lovell said
6257749 hes been like part of the family for a long long time
6257750 i think weve got some good news there i think shes doing quite well he said
6257751 farmers organisations have been saying to us since we came into government how can we help stop fruit rotting on the vine
6257752 this is their practical proposal we have responded in a modest way with a pilot program over three years that is a practical piece of action farmers want it we have done it
6257753 kay hulls therefore i presume the national party the national farmers federation appear to be supporting the governments position yet we have mr nelson and mr robb rowing in exactly the reverse direction
6257754 they the opposition are the ones that really matter he said to abc radio
6257755 they are the ones that should be looking at what they are doing particularly on budget measures
6257756 and any erosion of that by the liberal party through the senate will ultimately be at their peril
6257757 they should ensure that the government has got the ability to put downward pressure on interest rates and to help the reserve bank do its jobs
6257758 they the opposition are the ones that really matter he said to abc radio
6257759 they are the ones that should be looking at what they are doing particularly on budget measures
6257760 and any erosion of that by the liberal party through the senate will ultimately be at their peril
6257761 he made a really good start right out of the block he made a really nice birdie to get one up early on
6257762 he only dropped one hole to the guy and that was just through a tricky little putt that danny missed aside from that he didnt really do anything horribly all day a couple of little hiccups but really he just got out put the guy four behind early on and made him work to try and get back and he just wasnt up to it
6257763 dannys just taking it at a round at a time at the moment but hes the best amateur in the world by quite a way at the moment so hes pretty confident he can roll over anyone out there
6257764 it is very difficult for us to live with what has been dished out to us
6257765 all the countries have been invited after each match to put a report forward on every referee where they have got concerns
6257766 countries like england wales argentina and many others have all spent time after games submitting very mature reports that is very valuable to us
6257767 however i have yet to hear from the south africans all season there is a medium to go through and that is me but i have no sympathy for a coach that wants to go through the media rather than me
6257768 i will be meeting peter de villiers later in the month and if he has any grievances he will have a chance to bring them to me
6257769 they the referees should not be open to public enquiry just because coaches have their own agenda
6257770 its an irb rule but i dont know why we cant discuss these things before the game both coaches should be there the day before a game to speak to the referee
6257771 these days there are so many different interpretations of the laws all you want is clarity from the ref you want to know before hand you want him to tell you this is how i see it
6257772 the irb rugby committee agreed that no meetings take place with match officials so that no undue pressure was placed on them prior to matches
6257773 no other sport meets with the referee before hand and all teams with the exception of south africa have been very happy with this process
6257774 teams can and have contacted me with issues before games and national coaches are invited to report back on refereeing performances after internationals 80 per cent of the teams do so and this is a very useful resource for the irb referee selection committee
6257775 complaining about refereeing through the media is not the forum with which referees will be reviewed
6257776 captains dont have the right to question decisions but matfield was questioning almost every one and arguing
6257777 matt goddards lack of experience counted against him he should have stopped it its disturbing to see players disputing every decision they cant do that they are delaying the opposition and in a lot of cases it is done deliberately to slow the opposition down its got to be stamped out
6257778 i agree we have to be tougher we would like to see referees be a lot stronger in taking more sanctions against repeat offenders otherwise the players will say to themselves this is great we can get away with this
6257779 president mwanawasa was a true servant of the people who served this country with dignity and honor
6257780 we have lost a great leader who had a real vision for leadership and problems that face the country
6257781 has sunk into such economic difficulties that it may be likened to a sinking titanic whose passengers are jumping out in a bid to save their lives
6257782 he was a very outstanding politician who made a great contribution to his countrys development and regional peace and development
6257783 he attached great importance to zambias relations with china and did a lot for the friendly cooperation between the two countries
6257784 food prices tend to go up pretty quickly and they tend to stick on the way down
6257785 basically theres only a few cents worth of corn in a box of corn flakes so food prices are much slower to react to the downside than energy prices
6257786 we have been deeply troubled by the lack of responsiveness by some federal and state appraiser regulators in carrying out the law
6257787 we hope this article proves to be a catalyst for modernizing the existing appraisal regulatory structure and making it more effective
6257788 while some state appraisal boards do a good job of enforcement for whatever reason whether it be lack of funding or lack of mandatory licensing requirements more than a few do a poor job
6257789 he made a really good start right out of the block he made a really nice birdie to get one up early on
6257790 he only dropped one hole to the guy and that was just through a tricky little putt that danny missed aside from that he didnt really do anything horribly all day a couple of little hiccups but really he just got out put the guy four behind early on and made him work to try and get back and he just wasnt up to it
6257791 dannys just taking it at a round at a time at the moment but hes the best amateur in the world by quite a way at the moment so hes pretty confident he can roll over anyone out there
6257792 only the tail was recognisable there was wreckage scattered all over the place and dead bodies across a wide area a lot of them were children
6257793 the fuselage is destroyed the plane burned i have seen a kilometre of charred land and few whole pieces of the fuselage
6257794 i saw how the plane broke in two and a huge explosion
6257795 sas is doing everything possible to help passengers and next of kin and to assist spanish authorities
6257796 philip joins me in sending our warm and heartfelt sympathies to the families and friends of those who have died and our best wishes for a speedy recovery to those who have been injured she said in a message to king juan carlos of spain
6257797 in past weeks ricky histrion became a chesty ascendant by the relationship of match sons
6257798 matt and lucy friend had a child woman titled gia zavala on wednesday aug 20th everyones doing great
6257799 their friends are quite entertained that theyre effort backwards unitedly and are disagreeable to provide them space
6257800 i had a bounteous weekend i got mated to portia de rossi sorry evangelist stamos this ones taken
6257801 what we would then look at is a situation where were not hydrating and sterilising significant parts of the mine were actually seeking to preserve the asset so we would be able to ramp up at any point in that time if we got a significant change in metal price to a higher level of production
6257802 the amount that they are actually cutting 440 its a lot so its hard its a real shock at the moment and my heart goes out to everyone because you know weve been through it countless times before in broken hill
6257803 like i said to the boys six years ago at the end of pasminco i thought it couldnt get any worse
6257804 then perilya comes along and were six years later 400 people are going again
6257805 a lot of these lads young fellas a lot of them come here and work for perilya that never worked in the industry before come out from pushing trolleys at woolworths and theyve grown up and theyve learnt the mine trade
6257806 these things need to be considered it has to be a considered approach
6257807 anyone thinking about marrying this defendant would be well advised to consult her rap sheet before taking the plunge
6257808 the fact that no one in the government would actually vote to keep jon stanhope in the chamber reflects that perhaps even his colleagues were a bit concerned by his behaviour
6257809 there are predictions of reduced snowfalls in that region due to climate variation and often its said that this variations due to human intervention
6257810 the investigation has already begun to uncover some disturbing facts that seem to belie the innocent picture of downstream brokerages you paint in your letter
6257811 for example some evidence indicates that fidelity was actively marketing auction rate securities to its high net worth clients
6257812 fidelity does not actively market these securities and does not offer special financial incentives to representatives if they sell these securities
6257813 deliberately stuck their heads in the sand but continued to actively market these products to unknowing investors that will certainly be relevant to our calculus of the firms culpability
6257814 take full appropriate measures against any firms or individuals who have violated securities laws and we fully support them in their efforts
6257815 while we continue to see volatility in international markets and increases in the average cost of long term funding we have experienced some short term funding relief which we are keen to pass on to our customers he said
6257816 while i am pleased to make todays undertaking our medium and long term funding and our retail deposit base represent the greatest proportion of our funding costs and the average cost of these sources of funding continue to increase
6257817 the recent fall in short term funding costs provides an opportunity to undertake to move rates in line with the rba decision but future interest rate decisions will need to reflect an assessment of all the cost of funding factors
6257818 all australian banks are reliant on offshore funding and increases in the average cost of long term funding are likely to be with us for some time
6257819 therefore any consideration that the federal government can give to enhance the attractiveness of retail bank deposits will help reduce overall funding costs and assist in lowering mortgages rates
6257820 clearly we would love to pass through the full 25 basis points drop if that were to occur but well need to factor in all of those issues at that time she told an investor briefing
6257821 if lower short term money market rates are sustained and the reserve bank lowers the official cash rate there will be flow onto anzs variable rates an anz spokeswoman said this morning
6257822 you know what if i get married i wont even invite you cause youre going to be my bride

6257854 it is particularly appropriate this year that we remember the 26 australians and more than 300 north vietnamese who were killed during the fighting at coral balmoral in may and june 1968
6257855 these battles were australias largest and most protracted engagement of the vietnam war
6257856 i knew i had to take it out hard and run a pb to get through
6257857 the stones will be given to the blue mountains council the local rotary club and the national parks and wildlife service to be used in a number of heritage projects including the new cultural centre in katoomba a small retaining wall steps and reconstruction of a section of a walking track that links to coxs road at mount york
6257858 the rta has employed an archaeological company amac to carry out archival recording of the heritage road and the sandstone blocks before its removal and to prepare the statement of heritage impact for the department of planning
6257859 im nervous but im really excited as well i cant wait to meet the kids and get them excited by books
6257860 its hard to break into the industry you need to keep evolving and not get comfortable
6257861 we dont normally reveal these things as we are known by our clients for being discreet but for a little shop in leura that directly employs two staff its not a bad trick
6257862 weve been here for 13 years in terms of high profile this is as good as it gets
6257863 the idea was to combine australian timber with a chinese flavour
6257864 the australian olympic committee gave us a strict time limit and i think they were delighted with the results
6257865 the makers of the gifts are really talented australian craftsmen and we used a local supplier for the packaging
6257866 they made a few extra items for us its the sort of thing we want to keep
6257867 i think thats part of the the reason we were chosen for this
6257868 its nice because we are getting daily emails from the australian olympic committee with news about whats happening in the olympic village
6257869 i always thought it was a beautiful little station i used to see it when i worked as a freight guard on the coal trains to lithgow and this one just looked inviting
6257870 i continue to remain friends with some of those injured in that crash
6257871 were doing a check now on exactly where we have these bladders and having established that how we would best get them to the site the location and from there how we would best initiate the process
6257872 i still havent had final advice on whether its physically possible theyre getting back to me on that but i have confirmed that there are bladders around its theoretically possible but whether its practically possible im just not sure im still waiting for that additional advice
6257873 certainly defence stands ready to assist in any way we can
6257874 weve pretty much exhausted all the kind of practical options that you could possibly use here
6257875 we do need to be realistic that we are i guess getting towards the end of the process where were trying to balance the whales welfare with any hopes of rescue operations
6257876 from where it is in pittwater the whale actually can communicate quite effectively with the pods of whales going up and down the coast their sounds travel kilometres under water
6257877 but that communication obviously has not resulted in anything useful in the last few days so its increasingly clear that the wild whales are not interested in looking after colin for whatever reason
6257878 every other option needs to be explored and its got to be realistic
6257879 its great to have all these ideas of being able to do things but its got to be realistic and its got to be achievable the worst thing you could do is to prolong suffering with the animal no one wants to see that happen at all
6257880 one of the important issues which should cause concerns here is that humpback whales are the whales that australia has particularly taken a strong position with in terms of their protection and conservation at the international level
6257881 it is very difficult for us to live with what has been dished out to us
6257882 all the countries have been invited after each match to put a report forward on every referee where they have got concerns

6257896 will india live with the permanent rebuke to its democracy that kashmir represents or will it risk a new paradigm that might achieve what this endless cycle of mutual suspicion has not

6257906 there is an absolute recognition for years and years and years that there has been a labour crisis and a shortage in this electorate
6257907 none of the endeavours that have been put in place have resolved it my growers deserve a fair go
6257908 i am not sure where the advice is coming on this and i am aware that if there were concerns about health issues and criminal checks and et cetera that there are significant guidelines and criteria to be put in place to cover all of those aspects
6257909 im only too happy to have the most rigorous of criteria put in place just put the criteria in place give my growers an option if you can get australian labour into this electorate to be reliable and to stay for full harvest then fantastic but our efforts for the past at least 10 years that ive been the member have all failed
6257910 its a very different issue i think the indigenous needs but theyre certainly extremely important and they pacific islanders are taking nothing from them
6257911 our pacific islands neighbours have needs as well and were a large rich country with plenty to share for all
6257912 theyve got a lot of young unemployed people a very high percentage of young unemployed people
6257913 but theyre also looking to how theyre going face the bigger problem of what climate change is going to do to the very survival of their nation and what happens to their people

6257918 apart from a few matters that we feel could be swiftly addressed we found no major issue with the sale lease arrangements proposed by the state government advisers
6257919 we found they were generally consistent with other privatisations and restructures except in the case of the five year employment guarantee for certain generator employees which is greater than the guarantees in previous privatisations
6257920 despite making over a billion dollars profit the bank has reneged on its pledge to offer above inflation wage increases and is burying its head in the sand over targets staff and customers dont want unethical sales targets and the banks refusal to even look into this matter is a slap in the face to both groups
6257921 union members say it is time anz national behaved like any decent business and showed appropriate respect for its staff and customers i think new zealanders expect more from our largest corporate citizens
6257922 these strike meetings are an opportunity for union members to determine what it will take to achieve a fair deal from the bank given that it is refusing to budge at all from its offer of a 4 pay rise which is less than the rate of inflation
6257923 there is a significant personal and financial cost to union members whenever they seek justice for customers and themselves these meetings will determine how far we can push to get a fair offer
6257924 i guess it shows anz national really is putting profit ahead of its staff and customers
6257925 regarding tension between the ukrainian authorities and the black sea fleet im strongly against that i believe representatives for the ukrainian authorities should behave properly so that ukraine should not be drawn into military conflicts
6257926 i want the position of the ukrainian authorities to be deliberated so as the ukrainian territory should not be involved in any military tension this refers to the decrees on the black sea fleet
6257927 since its launch in 1992 the moscow times has been the one indispensable daily newspaper for the english speaking community in the russian capital with its excellent independent reporting of current affairs and outstanding business coverage it makes topical issues both accessible and absorbing the idea of starting the working day without the moscow times would be unthinkable congratulations to the board and staff on fifteen years of achievement and keep up the good work
6257928 it is clear to us and the u s leadership does not deny this that the anti missile defense in europe will broadened and modernized in this case russia will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic demarches
6257929 to freeze all military cooperation with nato and allied countries
6257930 we do not have the means to blow up such a bridge
6257931 time will show it depends on how the political process develops
6257932 we are beginning to see the early signs of some withdrawal
6257933 it is not significant and it needs to increase both the size and pace of the withdrawal needs to increased and needs to increase sooner rather than later
6257934 i dont honor his policies i dont honor his politics
6257935 theyll say hes young hes got a funny name hes not patriotic
6257936 barack obamas own campaign is the only one talking about his patriotism
6257937 we should be using some of that money to rebuild virginia laying roads building broadband lines and putting people back to work
6257938 we sure as heck dont have to give them incentives to move we should give companies tax breaks that are right here
6257939 it is not a problem related to ethnicity or religion
6257940 we can see from examples of closures of several mosques over the recent years very strict control over religion and also arrests of activists as well as people accused of violent offenses
6257941 usually if a uighur gets in trouble the police come and detain everyone in his family then they lose their jobs and have trouble getting new ones
6257942 unfortunately the olympic spirit is not at all respected by chinese officials inside tibet
6257943 there are restrictions on the circulation of information a very strong censorship and often civilians are arrested and tortured very violently to the point where they die
6257944 the chinese response is that if you put aside this nonsense we will make you wealthy
6257945 im drinking milk and looking on the carton and see a picture of k j noons
6257946 nick diaz is the no 1 contender the people want to see this fight
6257947 our representations to government have been about trying to decouple the idea of having channel a originally mooted for narrowcast tv services and channel b planned for mobile tv as the one package and move ahead of the allocation of the mobile licence
6257948 i think theres opportunities for mobile tv in australia considering there are more mobile telephones in australia than there are people
6257949 pretty much everyone knows that growing up in a household where the dad is a professional baseball player the last thing you talk about is baseball
6257950 so you understand history but you dont dwell on it because the father and son relationship is more important than the numbers
6257951 i dont really worry about that everybody else does im more concerned about getting hits and getting on base you get hits and home runs happen
6257952 but it is good to get the first one at home
6257953 hes been hitting the ball hard but hitting them on a line we dont need to worry about hit enough of them to prove he can do it
6257954 i think it obviously took him a couple years just to get adapted but i think hes made it his personal thing to make sure he displays his talent consistently
6257955 thats what i really focused on just knowing that when my number is called i can answer
6257956 thats what ive tried to focus on and i feel pretty confident with that right now
6257957 the coaches have done a great job preparing us and giving us an opportunity to learn how to recognize that type of a blitz it just shows the development in our offense
6257958 hes in a position where hes making those decisions tough and thats what we ask of all those guys
6257959 compete hard give us everything they have and make those decisions at the end tough
6257960 hes a tall target so the quarterbacks dont have any trouble finding him
6257961 hes got kind of sneaky speed hes a long stride guy and he can chew up some ground pretty quick on you
6257962 the solemn and periodic exaltation of male athleticism with internationalism as a base loyalty as a means art for its setting and female applause as reward
6257963 the results speak for themselves and thats been the case for the last few games
6257964 its nothing new and its something as a country we should be proud of
6257965 the pioneer women had to battle against prejudice and bias in the old australian olympic federation and i would say that attitude endured right up to the 1980s
6257966 im excited and it doesnt hurt i dont have any pain my vision is good again
6257967 this is my third pair of contacts in my left eye this week and it feels real good and im seeing pretty good out of them
6257968 the last time i played the u s open normal was back in 2001 when i got to the semi finals probably it was so long ago
6257969 every time i started to play well i was getting injured even when i was number one i got injured with the rib i couldnt play for two months and my ranking dropped and i lost confidence
6257970 but i am getting back again the results will come eventually the ranking doesnt really matter if you get the results it will come back
6257971 its been just over one year for us now and i am pretty satisfied
6257972 i am a little old to do certain things over the years it gets tougher and tougher to play well especially when you compare yourself with the years before
6257973 he understands he has a lot of patience and is the ideal person to travel with which is very important i am not under any pressure
6257974 the knee was difficult and i was risking a little too much
6257975 thats why my ranking dropped because without confidence you cannot make any more winners from the back of the court
6257976 all of a sudden the pain was gone and i could start at least to work on the movement i started to cover the court better doing more work in the gym
6257977 chris has been the driving force behind the change that the business has undergone over the last year
6257978 the promotion is well deserved and will enable him to do even more to improve the business the way we service our fans the impact we can have on amateur hockey on long island the leadership we show in the community and more
6257979 i know chris well enough that he will stop at nothing less in making the islanders the model franchise in the nhl
6257980 its a while since i have been under the radar maybe 01 or 02
6257981 but i am not someone who needs someone talking about them i am more concerned with how i am playing i realise there are better storylines this summer roger federer losing his number one ranking rafael nadal novak djokovic playing well on hard courts and
6257982 i just want to play well and i feel like i can make a big run there i know i can certainly compete
6257983 would i do it again yes because it was wimbledon
6257984 cincinnati is one of my favourite events usually a tournament that i do well in so missing that put a little hole in the summer
6257985 i think not going to the olympics is actually beneficial for me right now i have been able to squeeze in two more tournaments in washington and la my expectations are a lot better than they were when i was sitting on a couch after cincinnati
6257986 thats actually a question ive thought about before and i think i change my answer daily
6257987 s o regras estabelecidas agora que estamos chegando querem acabar com o mercado
6257988 quero que o maior n mero de pessoas ou am minha m sica eu tenho uma mensagem para passar
6257989 mymusic ph is part of the continuously evolving appreciation of music
6257990 in the past you had to wait until your music was available at record bars but sometimes the album was out of stock or it wasnt even available anymore later on with the internet you could buy songs directly from the web but you needed a credit card or would have to pay thru some other online payment scheme which can be quite inconvenient

6258008 there is much to tell and celebrate in the tough day to day work that our soldiers are doing in one of the most challenging environments any army has ever faced
6258009 thats one of those things most teams dont like to do when you start chop blocking theres a chance you lose someone so you have to do it in a controlled manner
6258010 i think we have done that and exposed our guys to it but at the same time not put them at risk
6258011 angel did not want to be dressed in your typical suit though as you can see angel has on what probably is an ed hardy knock off t shirt with the long white sleeves underneath you know you rocked this same look in 8th grade he also has on his dolce and gabbana sunglasses silver cross necklace and to top it off a new york yankees hat

6258020 over the course of many years with many ups and many downs stephanie was right by our side unwavering indefatigable
6258021 it was that fighting spirit that allowed stephanie to rise from modest beginnings to succeed in public service to become a one woman force for progress in our country
6258022 it wasnt enough for her just to break barriers in her own life she was also determined to bring opportunity to all those who had been overlooked and left behind and in stephanie they had a fearless friend and unyielding advocate
6258023 she worked so hard and gave everything she could im devastated wherever wed go wed speak of each other as brother and sister its an incalculable loss

6258049 the last time i played the u s open normal was back in 2001 when i got to the semi finals probably it was so long ago
6258050 every time i started to play well i was getting injured even when i was number one i got injured with the rib i couldnt play for two months and my ranking dropped and i lost confidence

6258058 its going to be like this 3 dimensional visceral sort of sublime movie
6258059 its all of kurts artifacts and archives and journals and yeah well have the music of course but the his home movies
6258060 ultimately i think the goal for that film is to make sort of a catcher on the rye for the next decade the reason kurt still resonates all over the world you go anywhere all over this planet and youll find kids who have kurt tattooed on their arms its because he spoke he was able to articulate his experiences as an alienated disenfranchised kid and thats why i think his music is still relevant today and resonates all over the world and i think we have to make the film thats in every one of those kids heads that represents them
6258061 you gotta do something different and new and add something to the cannon of work and so i think what this film will do is
6258062 the investigation has already begun to uncover some disturbing facts that seem to belie the innocent picture of downstream brokerages you paint in your letter
6258063 for example some evidence indicates that fidelity was actively marketing
6258064 fidelity does not actively market these securities and does not offer special financial incentives to representatives if they sell these securities
6258065 deliberately stuck their heads in the sand but continued to actively market these products to unknowing investors that will certainly be relevant to our calculus of the firms culpability
6258066 take full appropriate measures against any firms or individuals who have violated securities laws and we fully support them in their efforts
6258067 what does it matter anyway the book didnt sell well people arent ready to deal with the war yet anyway

6258129 residents also need to be vigilant in protecting themselves and reducing the places where mosquitoes increase their population
6258130 it is important that citizens follow the center for disease control and preventions cdc recommendations for personal protection
6258131 you should choose a repellent that provides protection for the amount of time you will be outdoors
6258132 repellents with a higher percentage of an active ingredient like deet typically provide longer lasting protection
6258133 the best way to prevent a mosquito bite is to eliminate backyard larval mosquito habitats
6258134 im always running into women who think im younger than i am so i dont want to disillusion them
6258135 why not try to start a mens studies department or try to get the womens studies department turned into a gender studies department and make sure it examines
6258136 major disruptive delays in commuter rail service which would have devastating effects on the riding public
6258137 thats the way it has been done throughout recent history
6258138 nick diaz is the no 1 contender k j noons should step up and be the champion that we think he is and take this fight nick diaz will take this fight any place anywhere noons management wont even return our calls
6258139 his manager doesnt want us talking to him directly who knows what k j even knows about the situation but his management is holding us hostage
6258140 hopefully k j wants the fight and hopefully he will instruct his management to take the fight k j signed a contract all we want is for him to honor that contract fight on oct 4 on cbs and prove that hes the champion we think he is right now hes not representing us as the elitexc champion
6258141 i am sick and tired of the president of the united states embarrassing me the world we live in is too complex to entrust it to someone else whose idea of intellectual curiosity and grasp of foreign policy issues is to tell us he can look into vladimir putins eyes and see into his soul

6258148 me parece un grav simo error hist rico proceder a derogar el decreto legislativo 1015 bajo la amenaza de huelgas y de tomas de carreteras
6258149 si se deroga este decreto legislativo el parlamento es libre de hacerlo pero tengo la obligaci n de decirle al per que es un grav simo error que impide el cambio y que lo nico que va a hacer es mantener un siglo m s a nuestras comunidades campesinas en la exclusi n y en la marginalidad
6258150 hasta hoy se les exig a por la ley tener m s de los dos tercios m s del 66 no s lo de los que viven en la comunidad sino de los miembros hist ricos que pueden estar en lima o en el extranjero por eso nunca las comunidades han podido tomar una decisi n

6258162 we will probably put in close to 20 000 feet of cable throughout the building
6258163 the joc itself will take nearly 4 000 feet of cable to operate

6258195 i joined a thinking persons church and will not give that up
6258196 due to the decrease in the number of worshippers attending services and the steadily increasing expense of operating and maintaining the building the congregation and the dioceses of colorado have agreed that the episcopal presence in colorado must come to an end
6258197 on the low end we have gigabytes ep45 ds3l for ddr2 based systems along with the ep45t ds3r for ddr3 based systems on the high end we have the much more exciting ep45 dq6 platform for ddr2 based systems and for the high end ddr3 landscape we have the cr me de le cr me of gigabytes p45 lineup the ep45t extreme
6258198 the ds3r was designed as an inexpensive essentials board and it exceeds its quota while we cannot recommend the board for multi gpu purposes that doesnt mean you cant use a good single card or a gx2 x2 or the second slot for another nvidia card for physx like any p45 if you can tweak the nuts off it the performance is exceptionally good and the gigabyte has plenty of options that work to do this
6258199 nikon boasts their coolpix s600 as the camera with the worlds fastest start up time and the worlds most compact design we set out to check out these claims as well as to test the capabilities of this small point and shoot camera we will look at the s600 from the view point of the everyday photographer

6258201 weve had a lot of flooding in isolated neighbourhoods people with anywhere from 6 inches 15 cm to 4 feet 1 2 metres of water in their homes
6258202 weve had just under 1 000 homes impacted by the flooding weve had to rescue people in boats and airboats
6258203 were getting beat on and beat on and beat on its still over us
6258204 this storm is turning into a serious catastrophic flooding event particularly in southern brevard county
6258205 it started off as a little tendinitis thing and it just exploded
6258206 it is a relief that its not something structural well just rehab it and get back as soon as possible

6258220 the key point to understand is the conflict that arose when georgia attempted to join nato
6258221 yandex is a very popular web site in russia there are yandex clubs similar to facebook groups that give a voice to people with common interests one such group called we dismantle politics war in georgia has nearly a thousand members who are distributing ddos attack scripts to their membership
6258222 greetings you can report to such and such place for induction into the military
6258223 any ni r come up in here hes going to get it
6258224 right now the challenge for photovoltaics is to make the technology less expensive
6258225 therefore the objective is find new materials and novel device structures for cost effective photovoltaic devices
6258226 the beauty of organic photovoltaics and organic leds is low cost and flexibility
6258227 these devices can be fabricated by inexpensive solution based processing techniques similar to painting or printing
6258228 the ease of production brings costs down while the mechanical flexibility of the materials opens up a wide range of applications
6258229 the research at sdsu is focused on new materials with variable band gaps
6258230 the band gap determines how much solar energy the photovoltaic device can absorb and convert into electricity
6258231 were working on synthesizing novel polymers with variable band gaps including high medium and low band gap varieties to absorb the full spectrum of sunlight by this we can double the light harvesting or absorption
6258232 we are working to develop these new light emitting and efficient charge transporting materials to improve the light emitting efficiency of full color displays
6258233 mind you plants cant run away from bugs and other pests they need to deal with them one of the things they do is to release volatile substances into the air so as to attract predators of the bugs
6258234 genetic engineering modification gm of green leaf volatile production holds significant potential towards formulating environmentally friendly pest control strategies it also has important implications for manipulating food flavor
6258235 for example the aroma of virgin olive oil stems from the volatiles synthesized by olives by modifying the activity of enzymes that generate these substances it may be possible to alter the flavor of the resulting oils
6258236 our work shows how you can convert one enzyme to another and more importantly provides the needed information for modifying the glv production in plants
6258237 a notable strength of this manuscript is the combined use of structural and evolutionary biology to draw new insights regarding enzyme function these insights led to the striking demonstration that a single amino acid substitution converts one enzyme into another thereby showing how a single point mutation can contribute to the evolution of different biosynthetic pathways this begins to answer the long standing question as to how the same starting molecule can be converted into different products by enzymes that look strikingly similar
6258238 we have discovered that they are also present in marine animals such as sea anemone and corals however we do not know what they do in these organisms
6258239 structural insights into the evolutionary paths of oxylipin biosynthetic enzymes
6258240 davin is the kind of guy that might take the boot off and play knowing him
6258241 so im not going to discount him playing in the opener or the third week of the season im just going to say that right now he will not play against jacksonville theres a chance he might not be ready for a couple weeks
6258242 im not happy with it to be honest with you
6258243 im sick for davin joseph hes one of the ringleaders on this football team so im disappointed im hurt for him im also confident that we have the stuff to pick up the slack while hes getting himself ready to play obviously its a tough blow for us here at this time but its also very exciting for somebody to step up
6258244 were working on our rotations at this point in time
6258245 obviously jeremy zuttah will be a factor at that position dan buenning has experience playing guard there are the possibilities of adding a player here or there so i dont want to say too much right now at this point were confident in the guys we have
6258246 the democrats in charge of this congress have been heavy on fluff and light on substance
6258247 online records listing chinese gymnasts and their ages that were posted on official web sites in china along with ages given in the official chinese news media however seem to contradict the passport information indicating that he kexin and jiang yuyuan may be as young as 14 two years below the olympic limit
6258248 what is this post really about i dont really feel that its about the gymnastics age limit or even really about whether fraud occurred at this point i believe that any reasonable observer already understands that age records have been forged this story now is really about internet censorship the act of removing evidence while at the same time claiming that the evidence is wrong for the first time i watched search records shift under my feet like sand facts draining down a hole in the internet will this stand
6258249 its our perspective that most numbers on algae yield are far in excess of reality some are beyond theoretical

6258254 they the opposition are the ones that really matter he said to abc radio
6258255 they are the ones that should be looking at what they are doing particularly on budget measures
6258256 and any erosion of that by the liberal party through the senate will ultimately be at their peril
6258257 they should ensure that the government has got the ability to put downward pressure on interest rates and to help the reserve bank do its jobs
6258258 dr ben cunneen hes been a very valuable employee with us for quite a long time dr lovell said on abc radio
6258259 he was the first person who became infected in this outbreak and hes been very very seriously ill in hospital
6258260 i just spare a thought for them for the last five weeks i guess it is theyve virtually had to maintain a vigil with him against overwhelming odds of any chance of success it is terrible
6258261 its just terrible theyre very very upset dr lovell said
6258262 hes been like part of the family for a long long time
6258263 i think weve got some good news there i think shes doing quite well he said
6258264 dr ben cunneen hes been a very valuable employee with us for quite a long time dr lovell said on abc radio
6258265 farmers organisations have been saying to us since we came into government how can we help stop fruit rotting on the vine
6258266 this is their practical proposal we have responded in a modest way with a pilot program over three years that is a practical piece of action farmers want it we have done it
6258267 kay hulls therefore i presume the national party the national farmers federation appear to be supporting the governments position yet we have mr nelson and mr robb rowing in exactly the reverse direction
6258268 i think it is time the liberal and national party the opposition sorted out whether they have got any policy on this at all
6258269 farmers organisations have been saying to us since we came into government how can we help stop fruit rotting on the vine

6258274 i am giving a lecture at oxford and i have been invited here by dr ian wexler andrew buchan another forensic anthropologist the top forensic anthropologist in england hes kind of like me in london the lecture is on interstitial lamellae remodeling one of my favorite subjects to speak about and booth falls asleep while im giving my lecture which i dont appreciate
6258275 ian wexler is the forensics guy over here and hes moving in on her which is fine but its also going to drive me crazy obviously
6258276 we will in fact see booth and bones together in bed naked
6258277 shut up yourself theyre naked in bed you betcha it may be the season ender it may not
6258278 angelas missing husband birimbau shows up during the season premiere and merry mix ups ensue i hope its not what anyone expects i hope people will expect either that everything goes great for everybody or that birimbau breaks up jack and angela and i dont mind telling you that neither one of those things happen

6258283 we are going to do more international shows the trip to england was at the suggestion of a studio executive but when you see how well we do in other countries it just makes sense ive recently traveled a lot and have seen bones airing in french polynesia and new zealand and bones is a forensic anthropologist and she can travel anywhere and she should
6258284 well i dont know a lot about john mccains family history i do know however that as recently as last week i think it was the senator made a comment in south dakota regarding his wife entering some buffalo chips contest which is this topless deal and if she were to enter she

6258343 we wanted to bring in rod stewart that year the home ministry told us to have it earlier than aug 31 and told us to shift the location from selangor to kuala lumpur despite doing everything the concert was cancelled
6258344 i pity the organisers they most probably wont get their money back if the concert is cancelled
6258345 the ministry has to understand the scenario faced by the promoters we do not have the artistes schedule months in advance on an ordinary basis we have less than three months to work on the concert and to prepare the necessary documents plus we have to start promoting the concert as soon as possible we are constrained by time
6258346 we want the best entertainment for the people but such incidents dampen our spirits

6258350 it is almost two weeks and police have not done anything to ensure that justice is served in the case of my sons death
6258351 even if he did snatch the datins handbag he doesnt deserve to die
6258352 following that the vips wife who was a datin had noted the victims motorcycle registration number and tracked him down
6258353 we followed the vip sons car to the place but could not do anything as some 25 men bashed him up in front of the datin
6258354 the success of national integration programmes is not true especially over the last six months when there was tension on issues relating to malay rights and solidarity there was extreme reactions when the bar council held forums on the social contract and conversion to islam
6258355 isnt this a failure of the efforts to promote national integration what is the ministry doing to stop racial claims like this
6258356 if we handle the people and countrys problems with honesty and justice im sure we will see a better situation
6258357 how could the people be expected to unite like this
6258358 its not true they are total lies by jeffrey kitingan we have been given the mandate by the people and we will not desert bn but will continue with our struggles
6258359 most of the times it is never the intention of victims of self inflicted wounds to disfigure themselves

6258367 we forwarded the case again to the aca for another probe
6258368 transferring the officer to another department is just a transfer it is not a punishment
6258369 weve had a very blessed life on the road and feel it is important to share wherever we can we get to feel good about what we do but the benefits go beyond ourselves it takes many caring communities to build a world we can all be proud to live in
6258370 i volunteer at the senior center where i live i help teach computers to senior citizens the main instructor makes up the lesson plans i assist by helping the class members work on their computers and apply what they have learned the instructor and i help the participants set up an e mail account on hotmail then we teach basics such as how to e mail others the differences between forward reply and even reply all and how to add attachments we also give them some basics of microsoft word including changing font styles and sizes and adding graphics finally we teach them some fundamentals of the world wide web each year we give three eight week sessions winter spring and fall the classes fill up quickly and there is usually a waiting list so i know they are getting something out of this the oldest member is about 85 they tell us they want to get with it and e mail their loved ones some say our children gave us a computer and we dont know what to do with it a few want to make their own holiday greeting cards the main instructor wishes i would teach a separate class so we can accommodate more people and eliminate the waiting list although i know i could do this it would seriously impact my rv time for now im happy to just show up and assist
6258371 the investigation has already begun to uncover some disturbing facts that seem to belie the innocent picture of downstream brokerages you paint in your letter
6258372 for example some evidence indicates that fidelity was actively marketing
6258373 fidelity does not actively market these securities and does not offer special financial incentives to representatives if they sell these securities
6258374 deliberately stuck their heads in the sand but continued to actively market these products to unknowing investors that will certainly be relevant to our calculus of the firms culpability
6258375 take full appropriate measures against any firms or individuals who have violated securities laws and we fully support them in their efforts

6258385 to look after this little whale you need to suckle it for 11 months thats never been done anywhere in the word before for a whale this size or for that long
6258386 you then need to get it to the antarctic where its food supply is
6258387 letting it go off sydney its got a 2 000km trip to make it doesnt know how to avoid killer whales or how to find krill
6258388 theres a whole range of extremely serious problems with the idea of getting this little whale through to getting it released in the wild
6258389 thats the advice were getting from every single expert that weve spoken to
6258390 its hard not to be sad when you see that calf in such a desperate situation

6258401 if hes not ready we wont pitch him well back him up another couple days
6258402 thats the way it goes i dont think that is going to happen but if it did we would back him up and i told him that
6258403 well pitch him when hes ready to pitch and not because his day comes up
6258404 the point is that beckett is really wanting to throw and thats always a good sign

6258409 if barack obama wants to have a discussion about truly questionable associations lets start with his relationship with the unrepentant terrorist william ayers at whose home obamas political career was reportedly launched

6258431 the hopi and mayan elders do not prophesy that everything will come to an end rather this is a time of transition from one world age into another the message they give concerns our making a choice of how we enter the future ahead our moving through with either resistance or acceptance will determine whether the transition will happen with cataclysmic changes or gradual peace and tranquility the same theme can be found reflected in the prophecies of many other native american visionaries from black elk to sun bear
6258432 the person with no previous exposure to the mayan calendar will usually initially be surprised by the fact that some people today take such an interest in an ancient calendar
6258433 why would the world today need another calendar than the gregorian or muslim that are currently in use and why should this be the mayan calendar
6258434 the gregorian calendar is not in harmony with the forces of nature
6258435 let all beings rise let not one or two stay behind

6258450 she will be the mother of the millennium that comes after the millennium
6258451 after the days of the devil she will make the softness of a mother flow
6258452 my mother gave me birth my true mother gave me life
6258453 your mother is in you and you in her she gives you life
6258454 wisdom is radiant and unfading and she is easily discerned by those who love her and is found by those who seek her
6258455 she hastens to make herself known to those who desire her
6258456 oh mother let my mind awake slowly on the sacred shore of the sea where great souls of the world have come together to offer their pranams here with outstretched hands we bow down to the divine in human form in bounteous poetry and in great joy we adore thee behold here oh seeker the mountain of meditation with rivers resounding and dancing to the solemn music of heaven adore here your sacred mother earth where great souls have come together on the seashore to offer their pranams come oh aryans come non aryans come hindus and muslims come come oh englishmen come christians come oh brahmins purify your heart hold the hands of the down trodden and out castes remove all ills and disrespect come quickly for the coronation anointing of the mother

6258458 a calendar cycle of twice the kal tun of 260 years had to go by in order for the solar culture to flourish again for the benefit of all humanity
6258459 in the year 1475 before the arrival of the spanish the supreme maya council revealed the long held vision of an ancient solar grandmother named xnuukkin that a calendar cycle of twice the kal tun of 260 years had to go by in oder for the solar culture to flourish again for the benefit of all humanity in the spring of 1995 this 520 year period will be completed thus 1995 is a decisive year and the human race will have to enter the path of the cosmic light if it is to remain a thinking species humans will have to seek the path of initiation on earth and in heaven through solar initiation they will be able to see the luminosity of the great spirit through solar initiation the sleeping body of humankind can be awakened
6258460 quetzalcoatl taught the ancients all the necessary skills to advance their civilization from mathematics and science to agriculture and astronomy as well as the famous mayan calendrical formulae which predicts the end of the world to be december 21st 2012
6258461 the temple of kukulkan the feathered serpent god also known as quetzalcoatl is the largest and most important ceremonial structure at chichen itza this ninety foot tall pyramid was built during the eleventh to thirteenth centuries directly upon the multiple foundations of previous temples the pyramid is a store house of information on the mayan calendar the northern stairway was the principal sacred path leading to the summit at sunset on the vernal and autumnal equinoxes an interplay between the suns light and the edges of the stepped terraces on the pyramid creates a fascinating and very brief shadow display upon the sides of the northern stairway a serrated line of seven interlocking triangles chakras gives the impression of a long tail leading downward to the stone head of the serpent kukulkan kundalini at the base of the stairway
6258462 this power is placed in the triangular bone which is called as sacrum which means greeks knew about this centre they very well knew about it thats why they called it sacred sacrum in many countries there has been a manifestation that they know about this particular power i happened to go to colombia where i collected an authentic antique copy of the antique necklace the necklace had at its bottom a kundalini and even the earrings had the kundalini but surprisingly it was from the indians of america though it is now kept in the museum in colombia it was in america that people knew about kundalini definitely absolutely in three and a half coil they had done this pattern very well is very surprising that it was done even before columbus came here
6258463 the great serpent mound in adams county ohio usa is considered to be the worlds largest serpent effigy
6258464 the great serpent mound continues to wind its quarter mile length along an ohio hilltop

6258466 i am here to tell you about the last breakthrough of our evolution
6258467 according to mayan calendar keeper hunbatz men the spring equinox march 21 of 1995 marked the end of that period of darkness since 520 years have now passed each mayan calendar cycle is 260 years to mark the event hunbatz men led a solar initiation on this date at chichen ltz one of the largest and most frequently visited ruins in the yucatan peninsula this initiation offered a genuine spiritual experience for the tens of thousands who attended most of whom were mayan the day was filled with wonder lamas from tibet and leaders of the supreme mayan council bestowed blessings upon attendees mayan music and dance was performed on stage and the incredible architecture of chichen ltz was available for all to view the ceremony came to a climax late in the afternoon when a shadow image of the serpent appeared on the pyramid of kukulcan this image appears bi annually at chichen itz and is a testament to the architectural and astronomical talents of mayan civilization at the equinox the sun hits in such a way that a shadow forms on one of the pyramids edges in the shape of a serpents body this shadow snake connects with a statue of a serpents head at base of the pyramid to complete the image of a holy mayan symbol representing fertility and re birth attendees responded with meditation chanting and prayer and displayed reverence for the miracle

6258487 we believe a female was involved in this but weve not made an arrest
6258488 physically active individuals who have more lean tissue than their sedentary counterparts often have a bmi that classifies them as obese when they actually have healthy body fat levels and the converse is sometimes true in that a thin but inactive individual may have a bmi that puts them within normal ranges when they actually have high levels of body fat
6258489 for people to begin to take a proactive approach to their health they really need to know what their percentage of fat versus muscle is
6258490 most studies have shown that by just adding one circumference measurement at the waist to bmi you can better predict a patients risk for type 2 diabetes and for all cause mortality waist circumference is also about twice as good at predicting future coronary heart disease than bmi alone

6258532 confirms that pg amp e is intent on re monopolizing the generation sector of the electric industry
6258533 if ratepayers are to reap the benefits that competition can offer more efficient generation technological innovation improved reliability lower costs and transparency the commission must forcefully reject pg amp es self serving proposal
6258534 iep suspects that pg amp es real motivation for proposing the tesla project is to expand its ratebase
6258535 should not be allowed to supersede the commissions competitive market first policy which is designed to bring long term benefits to ratepayers
6258536 once again pg amp e is exploiting the commissions commitment to reliability to force the commission to abandon the model of fair open transparent and competitive procurement that it has repeatedly endorsed
6258537 there can be no fairness or competition if one competitor is insured against risk by ratepayers while all others must bear the same risk alone

6258546 for too long families in new hampshire and across the country have struggled as washington has put the needs of special interests ahead of the needs of middle class families well it is time for a change
6258547 this november we are going to take our country in a new direction by standing up and fighting for the middle class again if we want a new direction in washington we need real change this fall
6258548 as a proud westerner and candidate for united states senate it is my honor to take part in this historic convention for change
6258549 in my home state of new mexico and around the nation its clear that voters will have a choice between leaders who will fight for our middle class and do whats right no matter what or those who choose to stand for the same failed policies of the past
6258550 i am honored to have the opportunity to address the democratic convention and speak to my vision to partner with senator obama and make washington work for working families again
6258551 oregonians are ready for the kind of change senator obama will bring to washington george bushs economy has been a disaster for oregon workers and families
6258552 next weeks convention will be a tremendous opportunity to talk about how we can change the direction of maine and our nation
6258553 i look forward to speaking to my fellow delegates about solving the energy crisis bringing our troops home safely and responsibly from iraq providing universal health care and expanding opportunities for the middle class

6258560 coding in c is like sending a 3 year old to do groceries you gotta
6258561 this is the first time that a study provides evidence that in the human brain dopamine is involved in the adaptations that result from sleep deprivation
6258562 these findings suggest dopamine may increase after sleep deprivation as a compensatory response to the effects of increased sleep drive in the brain
6258563 the extent to which this occurs may differentiate how vulnerable people are to the neurobehavioral effects of sleep loss
6258564 however the concurrent decline in cognitive performance which is associated with the dopamine increases suggests that the adaptation is not sufficient to overcome the cognitive deterioration induced by sleep deprivation and may even contribute to it
6258565 people dont consume as much calcium as nutritionists would like
6258566 and one reason for this is that foods high in calcium dont taste good to many people tweaking its taste could encourage a calcium deficient population to consume more of this key nutrient
6258567 by understanding how calcium is detected in the mouth we can either make it easier to consume by reducing its bad taste or even make pharmacological agents that make it taste better
6258568 most mice dislike calcium but we found a very unusual strain that drinks it avidly
6258569 by comparing the genes of this strain with other strains we were able to identify the two calcium taste genes
6258570 it remains to be seen if what we have discovered in mice the existence of two calcium taste genes holds true for humans
6258571 we know people have the sweet taste gene tas1r3 and the gene involved with the calcium sensing receptor casr we dont know if we have the same forms of genes as the mice have but it seems pretty likely they have the same function
6258572 there isnt a better word for it it is bitter perhaps even a little sour but its much more because there are actual receptors for calcium not just bitter or sour compounds
6258573 in tap water its fairly pleasant but at levels much above that the taste becomes increasingly bad
6258574 im not saying people cant take tablets to get enough calcium but eating real food is a great pleasure with salt sweet and fat the problem is to reduce intake without reducing palatability for calcium its a problem of being not palatable enough
6258575 reproductive dysfunctions include a range of menstrual disorders sexual dysfunctions and pregnancy complications that include spontaneous abortion or miscarriage
6258576 teenagers who drink tend to have disruptions in their menstrual cycle as well as unplanned pregnancies
6258577 higher rates of reproductive dysfunction in adult women may reflect the cumulative effects of longer exposure to alcohol for older women than for female adolescents
6258578 to our knowledge this is the first study to examine alcohols effects on reproductive onset across reproductive development
6258579 most previous research has examined risks to teens or adults but not both our findings highlight a risk associated with ad in women that is not widely recognized a risk that has assumed increasing importance given the increased rates of alcohol misuse by women and particularly young women
6258580 young women who drink alcohol may want to consider the longer term consequences for later childbearing
6258581 if drinking continues or increases to levels of problem use their ability and or opportunity to have children may be impaired
6258582 for women who are already experiencing fertility problems or other reproductive difficulties
6258583 the studys findings should warn them not to use alcohol to cope with stress caused by the reproductive problems because alcohol would likely make the reproductive problems worse as well as carrying risks of possible alcohol abuse or dependence
6258584 for example it would allow people entering the house to type in a four digit pin code on a pad by the door
6258585 if there was an adult in the house the children would be able to use the oven or microwave but they couldnt if they were home alone similarly it is a way to control or block content on the tv
6258586 we dont believe that we have set the ultimate standard here
6258587 but we believe we have moved the debate ahead by demonstrating that network control systems dont have to be too complicated it is simple for anyone who can use tv text to set up a device and an administrator after connecting a device can decide that it should only be visible or controllable by certain people
6258588 we demonstrated that devices could be automatically recognised by the network to move forward requires the manufacturers of home network enabled devices to agree on a number of standards
6258589 the study suggests that the critical ingredient in smoking that may be causing emphysema is cadmium a well known contaminant of cigarette smoke
6258590 the worry is if you are exposed to this cadmium through other sources you can also be at risk for emphysema
6258591 the big picture is we keep learning more about the contributions of environmental toxins to the chronic diseases of aging for which we never suspected an environmental cause
6258592 with a larger population we will be able to better disentangle the independent effects of cadmium and smoking and whether dietary cadmium or other non cigarette sources may also influence lung function
6258593 reducing the psychosocial impact of acne is considered one of the guiding principles for its clinical management and it is important to measure and evaluate this impact
6258594 knowledge of these patient preferences may help dermatologists balance clinical trial results with patients expectations of therapy
6258595 randomized blinded placebo controlled trials have shown that three to four months of conventional acne therapy including topical benzoyl peroxide topical retinoids and oral antibiotics typically produces reductions in lesion counts in the 40 percent to 60 percent range
6258596 it has also been suggested that the incidence of scarring from facial acne approaches 95 percent
6258597 thus adolescents marked preference for total clearance over partial 50 percent clearance or clearance with scarring suggests that physicians must weigh high patient expectations against these clinical data regarding efficacy and risk of sequelae
6258598 our findings may someday allow doctors to screen for and diagnose skin cancers at very early stages
6258599 chemical biomarkers may eventually serve as objective clinical markers of disease if effective sensor technology can be developed
6258600 our methods have the potential of providing early warning signs for cartilage disorders like osteoarthritis thus potentially avoiding surgery and physical therapy later on
6258601 also the effectiveness of early preventative drug therapies can be better assessed with these methods
6258602 it has all these painful consequences and makes it difficult to move it results in a severe loss of quality of life for those who are affected by it
6258603 given the lack of knowledge about oa i think any method that is noninvasive and relatively easy to apply will be quite valuable not only do you address diagnosis but you address how we can understand oas mechanism
6258604 there are drugs on the market for oa treatment but no one really knows how effective they are after having done the research we got a lot of calls from pharmaceutical companies wanting to show that their drugs work
6258605 i really hope it will develop into the gold standard technique
6258606 im pretty confident in saying that its one of the better methods out there for testing cartilage health
6258607 we saw that sporting events can be fertile ground for illegal alcohol sales and that the seats provide an especially high risk environment at events that every year attract an average of 130 million people
6258608 we know already that theres a link between alcohol use and problem behaviors among fans
6258609 but theres more that sports stadiums can do to prevent sales to people who are clearly drunk if people are intoxicated we dont need them to consume more alcohol
6258610 combining thousands of fans with significant alcohol sales could be construed as a recipe for some serious problems like increased instances of violence and drunk driving
6258611 given the results of this study stadium management and local and state elected officials may want to consider banning or restricting alcohol sales in the stands at sporting events as some stadiums have already done
6258612 however if such a policy is not politically feasible in a particular stadium vendors in the stands may need to receive additional training regarding responsible service of alcohol training that could include how to check age identification and more clearly recognize signs of obvious intoxication
6258613 in addition law enforcement and community groups need to actively monitor and work with stadiums to promote responsible alcohol service at these events
6258614 we are greatly saddened about the passing of congresswoman tubbs jones
6258615 this is a great loss for our party and our nation on behalf of the democratic party we extend our thoughts and prayers to congresswoman tubbs jones friends and family during this difficult time
6258616 i hope so before he got hurt he was pitching lights out
6258617 love to have him back tommy wants to end his career on his own terms
6258618 nobody wants to be forced to the sideline because of injury and he hasnt been able to produce this year because his arm hasnt been sound
6258619 i think theyll probably give him a look give him an opportunity this teams hurting for arms
6258620 i think most guys as they reach the end of their career are looking for that one last standout moment before they ride off into the sunset
6258621 hopefully if he can get this fixed and get back shoot itd be great
6258622 my personal dream came true late last year when a group led by roger kornberg at stanford university made a breakthrough experiment determining the atomic structure of gold nanoparticles of a certain size the structure resembled the prediction our research group had already earlier published in the recent study we were able to comprehend why nature generates exactly these kinds of particles the size of one particle is 1 3 nanometers and since they behave in many respects like giant atoms we call them superatoms in our study
6258623 our study would not have been possible without the extensive high performance computing resources of the national it centres of finland germany and sweden the study took up quite a lot of computation time but it was well worth the effort i believe that our theoretical model on the stability of the gold nanoparticles will prove itself very useful in many interdisciplinary fields of research
6258624 only in recent years has there been a substantial effort to manufacture child friendly formulations of first line tuberculosis drugs such as crushable mini pills granules oral suspensions
6258625 and in the past 15 years children have been included in only one study of new agents for tuberculosis a large phase 3 trial evaluating once weekly rifapentine isoniazid for treatment of latent tuberculosis
6258626 children have the same right to benefit from research as do adults
6258627 while this lack of involvement may be understandable in the short term it is not acceptable in the long term
6258628 everyone is great and she is a healthy beautiful baby girl
6258629 the tracking system is deployed and working which is great news
6258630 we started ultrasonic tagging programs in maine in 1997 and have learned much about salmon ecology in the estuaries and bays of the gulf of maine
6258631 our team is really excited that fish from our most recent work in the penobscot river have been detected so far along on their migration northward the first data provided valuable information about how long it took atlantic salmon from the penobscot river to reach halifax
6258632 given the fact that we are looking for a fish that is still less than a foot long that could be anywhere in the northwest atlantic ocean finding them in such apparent concentrations hundreds of miles from brewer maine is remarkable and very encouraging
6258633 broad scale ocean arrays such as the halifax array are a great tool to examine the marine ecology of such an uncommon fish in a large marine environment
6258634 we have three scientists in the labrador sea right now working with canadian colleagues as part of the international salmon at sea salsea project to determine where atlantic salmon are and are not and to try to get detailed genetic and dietary information about the various north atlantic salmon stocks
6258635 atlantic salmon are an iconic fish but theyre endangered and people want to know whats happening to the population
6258636 this is the first step to finding out where the salmon are dying and whats causing the decline
6258637 we know specifically where a tagged salmon has been and when and that helps us fill in a big gap
6258638 the news is encouraging in 2008 more than 2 000 adult salmon returned to the penobscot river to spawn the highest annual total in more than 20 years research like this ultrasonic tagging project will help us understand why and perhaps then managers can work to actively improve atlantic salmon marine survival

6258643 almost every assault of any kind if related to drinking the drinking age issue is not just about drinking and driving its a much bigger pie and we college presidents see that whole pie
6258644 legislators have made laws that the people do not take seriously students point to our alcohol programs and say see everybody understands that we are going to drink and theyre right
6258645 im pleased with the result it was nice to see the new players in game action
6258646 overall it was a positive experience now we have to build on the foundation that we got from today and move forward to sunday
6258647 they were found by a specialist volunteer who helps us clean the statuary in cliveden
6258648 he went to a talk at the local archaeological society given by a snail specialist mentioned his find and it turned out hed spotted the colony which had almost certainly been there since 1896
6258649 it was purchased and brought over from rome by the first viscount astor
6258650 hed been an ambassador in rome and was a great collector the villa borghese in rome which he bought it from now has a copy
6258651 what theyre doing what theyre eating we dont rightly know although its likely theyre feeding on lichen or algae growing on the marble
6258652 but whats important is theyve also been found in two possibly three other places at cliveden so all our eggs are not in one basket from a conservation point of view
6258653 if in fact a person is generating enough packets that theyre the ones creating that situation we will manage that consumer for the overall good of all of our consumers

6258655 we rethought those plans and came up with a way to put a lid on the cells instead of the razor wire
6258656 the important thing is this has to function as a normal jail
6258657 the nature of jail is to create an environment where you can maintain security and order and one of our primary charges is the care and custody of inmates

6258660 it was very hard to arrive at the scene of the accident we have saved those we could said miguel angel sanchez who was in charge of the fire service operation
6258661 we have set up several special rooms in the airport to look after the families psychologist juan antonio carujo said on cadena ser radio
6258662 but the uncertainty makes the situation all the more stressful
6258663 but there is much that must be done both in and beyond the judicial system
6258664 a real worry is the knowledge that some victims will not come to the criminal courts to give evidence because of fear and equally they look askance at the family court because of the uneven standard of security we can and must do better
6258665 i dont want to be remembered as the guy who got stuck in the bathroom
6258666 as evidence of the short story in canada both inside and in particular outside of penguins anthology
6258667 of course the best antidote to the disappointment of the literary life is to read
6258668 we got left out and so did other people we like
6258669 and if after reading the stories you are not compelled to go searching for more of the same well then im afraid that your case is hopeless theres nothing else we can do for you
6258670 this woman has been seen on gloucester street and the hagley park area wearing night attire similar to joans

6258678 they the opposition are the ones that really matter he said to abc radio
6258679 they are the ones that should be looking at what they are doing particularly on budget measures
6258680 and any erosion of that by the liberal party through the senate will ultimately be at their peril
6258681 they should ensure that the government has got the ability to put downward pressure on interest rates and to help the reserve bank do its jobs

6258684 these will be first rate facilities for children with delayed development disabilities hearing and visual impairments
6258685 working together under one roof will help improve multi agency assessments particularly of children with very complex needs who need a number of specialist assessments
6258686 we are looking forward to some improvements in all the services through a more environmentally friendly building better access as the venue is close to the town centre and links with local residents
6258687 tickets for our classical night starring russell watson and opera divas all angels are really selling fast now weve seen a surge in sales since the flower show when we were out and about with flyers
6258688 people do tend to wait to buy tickets until close to the event date but in this case we would urge them to book now in order to avoid disappointment this is a massive event for the county featuring a world class line up and we fully expect it to sell out
6258689 layla was quite simply the busiest 11 year old i have ever met
6258690 she loved to sing and dance and write produce and direct a series of plays which were always performed at the drop of a hat
6258691 she was the happiest of children caring grateful and thoughtful
6258692 good night sleep well my dearest and thank you for nearly 12 happy happy years
6258693 farmers organisations have been saying to us since we came into government how can we help stop fruit rotting on the vine
6258694 this is their practical proposal we have responded in a modest way with a pilot program over three years that is a practical piece of action farmers want it we have done it
6258695 kay hulls therefore i presume the national party the national farmers federation appear to be supporting the governments position yet we have mr nelson and mr robb rowing in exactly the reverse direction
6258696 i think it is time the liberal and national party the opposition sorted out whether they have got any policy on this at all
6258697 farmers amp squo organisations have been saying to us since we came into government amp squo how can we help stop fruit rotting on the vine
6258698 dr ben cunneen hes been a very valuable employee with us for quite a long time dr lovell said on abc radio
6258699 he was the first person who became infected in this outbreak and hes been very very seriously ill in hospital
6258700 i just spare a thought for them for the last five weeks i guess it is theyve virtually had to maintain a vigil with him against overwhelming odds of any chance of success it is terrible
6258701 its just terrible theyre very very upset dr lovell said
6258702 hes been like part of the family for a long long time
6258703 i think weve got some good news there i think shes doing quite well he said
6258704 dr ben cunneen he amp squo s been a very valuable employee with us for quite a long time amp squo amp squo dr lovell said on abc radio
6258705 by definition anything from cook is pretty rare and pretty magical
6258706 there are incredibly few things which is why this auction is so exciting and also because its a boomerang which is such an iconic thing
6258707 there are plenty of cook collectors and i would think some australian institutions would be interested
6258708 our plans were to start work on the lake last year but we had to put them on hold as the ecological and environmental aspects associated with this project restricted the time of year that physical works can take place
6258709 this meant that work could only take place between the middle of september through to the end of january were hoping to appoint a contractor imminently and that they will be onsite at the beginning of october
6258710 there is one thing ive got to say sam this is my house too this is gods house
6258711 look at the candidate and say does he live with integrity serve with humility share with generosity or not
6258712 we are starting to increase the number of services we can provide based on assessment of the clinical urgency of the cases and our ability to continue with our isolation protocols
6258713 there are currently 30 patients in isolation at dunedin hospital and three wards are closed to admissions at the hospital
6258714 we are going to continue with some outpatient clinics and procedures tomorrow at dunedin hospital
6258715 the majority of clinics operating will be in areas where physical isolation from the wards can be maintained
6258716 we are starting to increase the number of services that we can provide based on assessment of the clinical urgency of the cases and our ability to continue with our isolation protocols
6258717 however we urge all visitors and patients who do come to the hospital to abide by our hand hygiene enforcements if they do need to be in the hospital
6258718 im not a politician so ill just leave it for the politicans to do
6258719 i cant do the backstabbing shit they do i honestly dont know what i was thinking when i decided to run in the first place this isnt for me at all i just thank god i have a strong private practice and thats what ill be doing
6258720 im committed to doing what i got to do and im on schedule right now
6258721 i hope and expect that if i do the right thing theyll be fair with me

6258723 lowering that age is not going help binge drinking its not going help this problem however i am concerned that it will lower and push down the drinking age to kids in our high schools
6258724 we have to get gasoline prices down and we have to get good paying jobs to montana
6258725 so the more i can learn about this operation and see how to expand it thats good paying jobs and may contribute in a small way to getting gasoline prices down
6258726 im pleased to see some of you with very solid focus here today
6258727 i know this subject can be hard and some of you are clearly frustrated but are keeping at it anyway and so special kudos to you
6258728 for those of you who have never done this before thank you for giving me and this subject your time and attention and willingness
6258729 the meeting went very well we had about 15 to 20 young people there
6258730 they decided on which one they would prefer so ive been getting prices theyve got a preferred location so we are looking at that

6258748 while we continue to see volatility in international markets and increases in the average cost of long term funding we have experienced some short term funding relief which we are keen to pass on to our customers he said
6258749 while i am pleased to make todays undertaking our medium and long term funding and our retail deposit base represent the greatest proportion of our funding costs and the average cost of these sources of funding continue to increase
6258750 the recent fall in short term funding costs provides an opportunity to undertake to move rates in line with the rba decision but future interest rate decisions will need to reflect an assessment of all the cost of funding factors
6258751 all australian banks are reliant on offshore funding and increases in the average cost of long term funding are likely to be with us for some time
6258752 therefore any consideration that the federal government can give to enhance the attractiveness of retail bank deposits will help reduce overall funding costs and assist in lowering mortgages rates
6258753 clearly we would love to pass through the full 25 basis points drop if that were to occur but well need to factor in all of those issues at that time she told an investor briefing
6258754 if lower short term money market rates are sustained and the reserve bank lowers the official cash rate there will be flow onto anzs variable rates an anz spokeswoman said this morning
6258755 yes i am in a bad mood no it is nothing to do with you yes i will get over it understand good lets go on with the lesson
6258756 weve had a lot of flooding in isolated neighborhoods people with anywhere from 6 inches to 4 feet 1 2 meters of water in their homes
6258757 weve had just under 1 000 homes impacted by the flooding weve had to rescue people in boats and airboats
6258758 were getting beat on and beat on and beat on its still over us

6258774 the moment the lebanese government confers legitimacy on hezbollah it must understand that the entire lebanese state will be a target in the same way that all of israel is a target for hezbollah
6258775 during the second lebanese war we considered the possibility of attacking lebanons infrastructure but we never resorted to this option because we thought at the time that all the lebanese were not responsible for the hezbollah attacks
6258776 the moment hezbollah takes control of the lebanese government we will have to address the consequences
6258777 the right of lebanon its people its army and its resistance to liberate its land
6258778 during the war in lebanon we had a massive capacity that we refrained from using because we were fighting a terrorist organization and not a state but if lebanon becomes a hezbollah state we will not be so restrained

6258781 great appreciation to the courage of sheikh hasan al shahhal
6258782 we respect the salafists choice of freezing the memorandum of understanding for more discussions and revisions they will find hezbollah is always by their side in any decision they find appropriate
6258783 all of the positive support to the hezbollah salafist mou revealed its importance in enhancing dialogue between different islamic and national forces and in facing challenges
6258784 we also heard severe criticism of the mou from some leaders despite the fact that its content is nonnegotiable to any muslim
6258785 the agreement will be temporarily frozen pending appropriate circumstances that allow for its implementation
6258786 needed more than ever to stand united and shun divisions
6258787 unacceptable any agreement should be done here with mufti qabbani and the leader of the future bloc saad hariri the religious and political leaders of the sunni sect cannot be disregarded
6258788 surprised at hostility created following rapprochement between any two lebanese groups
6258789 any rapprochement or understanding between two lebanese groups should be met with a favorable reaction rather than with tension the exacerbation of sensitivities and the reopening of wounds
6258790 we are excited to bring on a talented executive to assume this position on an interim basis until we announce a permanent chief financial officer

6258793 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative
6258794 franks portrait of the conservative movement sacrifices complexity to caricature

6258796 the lovers in the gargoyle have the intimacy of roommates who hook up when they get drunk not a time defying passion their thoughts feelings conversations and affections are so unformed so hampered by sentiment and under powered awkwardness that the courage endurance and under standing ascribed to them seem silly davidsons lovers are dysfunctional and quirky qualities that can look a bit like profundity from a distance but they dont have emotional or imaginative depth or range which at the end of the day are the only things that can make a love story deep and wide ranging
6258797 west has made 15 reporting trips to iraq over the last six years and is almost as personally invested in the current conflict as he was in vietnam this book his third on iraq is his attempt to ensure that the endgame in iraq turns out better than in his last war
6258798 sharp as he can be in his judgments he is equally sharp in identifying the virtues of what he doesnt like he gives a spacious view of the countryside whatever the particular road he hews through it he takes his subjects seriously but not himself like snow white you might say
6258799 i read the suicide index with a rapacity bordering on need with tears in my chest and in my eyes occasionally i had to put it down and leave the room more often i devoured it the book is the product of a loving daughters grief and part of her process of grieving but it is also the measured elegant gripping work of a professional writer who has set her powers of observation to work on her own family her parents and grandparents her uncle her sister her husband her son and on herself
6258800 the storys emotional intensity is relentless and all of it light or dark is rendered at the same fever pitch the most consuming love until tomorrow when itll get even better the most consuming pain until tomorrow when itll get even worse bella whose human self is bumbling always blushing and a terrible driver becomes the strongest most beautiful most confident vampire ever jacob who begins the tale impatient and cranky also ends up in a new exalted state it might be unreasonable to expect a young adult vampire romance novel to be anything other than hyper intense but what it left me with was this thought readers are permitted to be breathless but stories arent

6258802 i bought webwatcher software and installed it on my 15 year old daughters computer after becoming concerned about changes in her behavior
6258803 i was quickly able to get enough information using webwatcher to call the police who then arrested my daughters 39 year old hockey coach who was later convicted using the evidence from webwatcher
6258804 webwatcher proved to be a useful tool in this case and assisted in putting a child sex offender behind bars
6258805 i was amazed that many parents know little about webwatcher and even our courts know very little about it
6258806 but ill be telling as many parents as possible about it
6258807 dont worry well be home soon be a good boy
6258808 it is my hope that reading these stories inspires some to plant their own seeds of change that when we see something wrong well do something about it whether that means writing to your representative in congress or researching a cure for a disease or simply speaking out against inequality and prejudice were all in this together and the first step toward change can begin with any one of us

6258836 i almost ruled out reading this book when i read the authors to me bold statement on page 225
6258837 being at times a very fast poet i gasped when i read that assertion

6258841 the man who reads nothing at all is better educated than the man who reads nothing but newspapers
6258842 our growth has been enormous particularly in the uk where our office has grown from three to 15 in the past 12 months and we now have five teachers on staff as trainers
6258843 in 2004 a total of 35 000 students in five countries were using studywiz today we are in 21 countries with 1 2 million students using the platform and we are still growing
6258844 we now have 80 staff located on four continents in more than 16 different locations we are in four states in the us in six locations in britain as well as in germany ireland malaysia hobart and melbourne
6258845 we do three way video chats over broadband internet connections often connecting three continents its fantastic
6258846 this will help us engage at a much higher level with departments of education catholic dioceses and people like that because it is an institution wide application
6258847 to be a discriminating user of the internet is one of the most important skills we can give students
6258848 we will need to consider making that a formal part of the education system and students will need to be tested on it that needs to happen and it is very likely to happen in the future
6258849 ringing a friend and sitting for an exam having recourse to the internet or other online technologies would make the running of examinations extremely difficult
6258850 i think that it is interesting to see people being adventurous and exploring new technologies in all areas of learning including assessment
6258851 but the situation that faces most people within nsw is that sooner or later they will be obliged to take examinations that require them to demonstrate rote learning
6258852 i support having some tasks where students can access information from as many different sources as possible including the range of different technologies available
6258853 however knowledge is important and committing information to memory will always have a place in the school curriculum
6258854 that by taking such devices into the exam room they would risk a zero mark in the course
6258855 durante casi medio siglo los estados unidos han impuesto un embargo comercial contra cuba y sin embargo a veces ste se hace poco visible

6258862 kendra wilkinson has been offered her own reality show about starting her life over again when she moves out of the playboy mansion
6258863 i think the formal process kicked off with the establishment of a nato georgia commission
6258864 i think its right to see georgian and ukrainian membership as part of a process to build up these countries as a permanent fixture not just as an accident
6258865 an important signal but there is also important substance to it
6258866 in practical terms nato is offering close cooperation with the georgian government and the georgian military

6258876 miss fozzard is judging other people for their foibles and is completely unaware of her own
6258877 it just never crosses her mind which is such a common human trait
6258878 i think i share a similar quality to her i feel the need to impress

6258886 premetto che non do nessun valore ad una partita del genere tra due squadre con motivazioni completamente differenti detto questo credo che denis stato servito poco da una squadra che sembrava che solo aspettava il fischio finale per andar via
6258887 domizzi a differenza di giocatori italiani ed esteri che ogni giorno mi chiamano perch vogliono venire a napoli non ha voglia di rimanerci ma noi lo riteniamo un titolare del napoli che ha conquistato lottavo posto in serie a lo valutiamo come un giocatore importante per cui se arriver la sua valutazione lo cederemo per fargli un favore per aiutarlo se non arriver noi dobbiamo dare un segnale su come sono i comportamenti di questo club
6258888 pi stato importantissimo nella scalata dalla c 1 alla b ha contribuito molto anche per quella dalla b alla a poi ha avuto un momento in cui non riuscito a capire che in un napoli cresciuto cosi in fretta non poteva avere assicurato il posto di titolare negli ultimi tempi andato in giro per litalia e forse ha capito cosa vuol dire giocare fuori da napoli e credo che oggi sia pronto per essere uno dei 20 giocatori fondamentali del napoli
6258889 io non posso dirlo farei un danno alla mia azienda cercate di scoprirlo voi cosi il gioco molto pi bello

6258892 obamas support among voters between the ages of 18 and 29 which had been one of his strengths slipped 12 percentage points to 52 percent mccain who will turn 72 next week was winning 40 percent of younger voters
6258893 the dip in support for obama who would be the first black u s president cut across demographic and ideological lines he slipped among catholics born again christians women independents and younger voters
6258894 we rethought those plans and came up with a way to put a lid on the cells instead of the razor wire
6258895 the important thing is this has to function as a normal jail
6258896 the nature of jail is to create an environment where you can maintain security and order and one of our primary charges is the care and custody of inmates

6258899 i went back to the village had a shower watched perez and came back to the venue when i saw he won
6258900 i was really happy to get a second shot but my performance was under par it was difficult having to wait so long i was anxious to have another go and normally there wouldnt be such a long delay
6258901 seeing perez win really got my blood pumping again but im gutted about my performance
6258902 but i dont know how they didnt see that point
6258903 it is my first olympics and my countrys first olympic medal i am delighted

6258906 i name do solemnly swear that i will bear true faith and allegiance to the constitution of the united states of america and will defend it against all enemies foreign and domestic and will obey the orders of the president and the officers appointed over me so help me god
6258907 whats the matter with you dont you know what step forward means
6258908 sure i do but i am not volunteering to serve in the military if you want me you must take me against my will by force
6258909 by what authority do you a military officer order me a civilian
6258910 i order you by the authority of the united states government
6258911 which clause of the constitution gives you a military officer to order me a civilian
6258912 am i under arrest am i your prisoner am i kidnapped if im not free then what am i
6258913 well i must be free to go because i asked you three times and you wont tell me im not
6258914 said the step forward is what would make me a soldier as i didnt take the step im still a civilian and the army has no claim on me
6258915 the army isnt being run by childish games willie and a hundred others appeared to be inducted and he was inducted before the whole group as any fool there could plainly see
6258916 were going to elevate that kind of draft to be a priority
6258917 to receive basic military training and education for a period of up to one year
6258918 p funk keyboardist bernie worrell was initially the flashpoint for the projects laswell parliament herbie hancock core his associations fortuitously coalescing just as laswell was striving to expand his axiom empire bringing together key players from all decades he then twisted the mix with clever combinations of newly recorded material and sessions recorded long ago but never released the sly stone tracks were recorded during maceo parkers all the kings men period while the eddie hazel tracks were among the last he ever recorded shortly before his death in late 1992 in all its guises however funkcronomicon is a masterpiece from the old school jams of george clinton bootsy collins worrell and hazel to hancocks jazzed out funk and the righteously fresh sounds of reggae rhythm section sly dunbar and robbie shakespeare this fat double disc really packs a punch add the alternative rock stylings of anton fier best known for his work with the feelies and the golden palominos and the resulting brew is almost unbelievable

6258926 really source of proof please science observation proves you wrong and a habitual chronic pathological liar as well
6258927 on june 12 1980 a third explosive eruption produced 25 feet of stratification that amazed geologists successive layers are traditionally thought to require long periods of time to form yet upwards of 100 layers accumulated mostly between the nighttime hours of 9 and 12 while a plume swiftly ascended nine miles above the mountain wave after wave of pyroclastic flows began hurtling out of the crater and down the north slope each dusting the valley below with another lamination measuring from a fraction of an inch to over a yard in thickness each took from a few seconds to a few minutes to form
6258928 geologist steven austin described these pyroclastic flows as ground hugging fluidized turbulent slurries of fine volcanic debris they moved down the mountainside at hurricane speeds and left deposits of 1000 degrees f one would expect each deposit to be homogenized amp thoroughly mixed remarkably these high velocity slurries of red hot ash and pumice separated into coarse and fine particles of perfectly defined layers such features follow laws governing flows demonstrated in laboratory sedimentation tanks
6258929 similar thin layering appears in the tapeats sandstones of the grand canyon
6258930 yup you could explain to me that you have observed first hand the layering in your septic tank too im sure there is an analogy here but it escapes me at the moment do tell what is the connection
6258931 i suppose you did read darwins radio your choice of reading materials reveals a lot dawkins specialties are fiction and fantasy not observable science his much acclaimed among fools weasel analogy was a complete fraud youre clutching at fables in a last ditch effort to avoid the conclusion that there is a god to whom you will answer one day youre not ready for that
6258932 hey bj antibiotics kill bacteria not viruses you cant kill viruses with antibiotics and viruses dont mutate in response to antibiotics theyre unaffected sheesh i would have thought you would get it the first time you were corrected your knowledge of science is pathetic and youre a very dense slow learner
6258933 so we have layer upon layer fair enough of varying thicknesses of pyroclastic flows why is that such a big deal and yet again i gave to remind you that such layers are not sedimentary
6258934 yah and bears make big potty in the woods so what are you still beating that one trick pony i regret to inform you but your hobbyhorse is dead
6258935 are you a complete freaking idjit the point is that the aggregates were not only layered but segregated according to aggregate size what you have at msh is 25 feet of finely layered segregated aggregates laid down in 3 hours not a long series of separate volcanic eruptions one ringy dingy two ringy dingy if you cant comprehend the material go back to the nursery and retrieve your binky
6258936 for anyone who just tuned in see 7 wonders of mount st helens
6258937 compare the fish pig and human embryos which animals are probably more closely related and why
6258938 they maybe layered but they formed as a result of volcanic activity so they are not sedimentary rocks sorry for shouting but hopefully it may sink in eventually
6258939 the reason it hasnt been discovered before is no right thinking paleontologist would do what mary did with her specimens we dont go to all this effort to dig this stuff out of the ground to then destroy it in acid
6258940 how many artifacts are needed to prove that man and dinosaur co existed it would seem to present a major difficulty for evolutionists to explain the representation in art or literature or in artifacts of recognizable species of dinosaurs by ancient men who supposely had never seen one alive one could surmise that perhaps they had merely come across fossils but surely they would not have had the necessary skills to assemble them and then to draw them or describe them as in life modern scientists have themselves occasionally placed the wrong heads on skeletons or combined the bones of more than one specimen this presents a problem if you believe in uniformism and evolution
6258941 actually crime is on the rise especially rape and murder it may still be low but for countries with small populations its a drastic increase on top of that scandinavia in particular norway has cultivated and spawned some powerful anti religious movements the black metal movement that grew to infamy in the 1990s hit the national newspapers with almost one hundred church burnings and espoused a venomously anti christian doctrine its adherents worshipped odin the norse gods and satan they wanted not only the continued decline of christianity but a revival of nordic paganism in addition scandinavia has a healthy population of laveyan satanists so there still religious the just don t follow the bible paganism has always been in scandinavian countries and its been on a sharp rise in the last 20 years santa clause is worshipped every year all over the world santa came from the scandinavian religions of old so there quite religious just not christian
6258942 why would i do that the bible goes all the way back to creation its not given by an angel of light
6258943 compare the fish pig and human embryos which animals are probably more closely related and why
6258944 your density amazes me both gas charged slurries which formed the msh strata and water charged slurries which formed the tapeats strata follow the same laws of physics i e they follow laws governing flows of fluidized turbulent slurries of debris demonstrated in laboratory sedimentation tanks the volcano has demonstrated that such formations can be formed rapidly a global flood would have produced tapeats in a brief time
6258945 the difference is that this demonstration of the behavior of fluidized turbulent slurries of debris at msh was a gas charged slurry while the flood was primarily a demonstration of the behavior and end results of water charged slurries on a much more massive scale the flood also involved the laying down of volcanic debris but the whole demonstration was inundated with water for a year so what happens when volcanic debris is thoroughly mixed with other types of aggregates and subjected to the conditions that have already been demonstrated in laboratory sedimentation tanks hm m m m would you not get the rapid formation of a great number of segregated layers of sedimentary rock in a very short period of time good grief man the ancient romans used volcanic sand and ash to make concrete doesnt that tell you anything
6258946 you also said they were living matter which they are not now that is an interesting hypothesis viruses which are not alive mutate therefore proving evolution in living things somebody help me with this i swear that somewhere i read that the flatworm was evolving faster than the human my thought then why are they still flatworms
6258947 red bloods cells in a 65 million year old fossil
6258948 how many artifacts are needed to prove that man and dinosaur co existed it would seem to present a major difficulty for evolutionists to explain the representation in art or literature or in artifacts of recognizable species of dinosaurs by ancient men who supposely had never seen one alive
6258949 one could surmise that perhaps they had merely come across fossils but surely they would not have had the necessary skills to assemble them and then to draw them or describe them as in life
6258950 modern scientists have themselves occasionally placed the wrong heads on skeletons or combined the bones of more than one specimen
6258951 the reason it hasnt been discovered before is no right thinking paleontologist would do what mary did with her specimens we dont go to all this effort to dig this stuff out of the ground to then destroy it in acid
6258952 no the simple answer is that the drawings are based upon fear of the afterlife and legend
6258953 i would expect that from someone who is simple minded
6258954 red bloods cells in a 65 million year old fossil
6258955 oh boy you actually think you got me on that one did i ever imply that she was a creationist in fact i am glad she is not because if she were a creationist then oh boy how simple it would be to dismiss her discovery get it indeed i like the fact that she is not doh the point of the post was despite the evidence scientists will simply dismiss it its not oh well we should look at our dating methods its like we have to reevaluate how fossilization occurs oh we know this is 80 million years old because of the layer huh so after knocking down your straw man how do explain her discovery
6258956 the rocks turned out to be ancient burial stones that the inca indians placed with their dead almost one third of the stones depicted specific types of dinosaurs such as triceratops and stegosaurus and various pterosaurs the type of art form represented by these stones and their location dated them to the time of the inca culture c a d 500 1500 how could these ancient indians have known the anatomy of these creatures if they never had witnessed them firsthand
6258957 interestingly several diplodocus like dinosaurs on the stones have what appear to be dermal frills something never previously reported by scientists
6258958 also the skin of many of the carved dinosaurs resembled bumpy rosettes
6258959 again we must ask how could the incas have drawn such accurate pictures of dinosaurs if they never had seen the animals or had them described by someone who had seen them
6258960 see above in other words why are you so easily dismissing them as mere mythical creatures as i keep saying believe in this stuff and you must also believe in the hydra
6258961 yeah right if its one thing that a scientist wants is the respect of his peers
6258962 there is no evidence against evolution thats not my view in the slightest i simply dont take adaptation and mutation to be evidence for it
6258963 dinosaur soft tissue sequenced similar to chicken proteins http news nationalgeographic com news 2007 04 070412 dino tissues 2 html now look at that now is it so easy to dismiss finding soft tissue in dinosaur bones if you believe that it supports your belief well no you probably believe that birds are descended from dinosaurs thus it proves true
6258964 to me it seems still that while it can prove the 2 may have been related i still simply dont believe soft tissue could survive 65 million years
6258965 on another note though i be a creationist i am not a new earther
6258966 two years ago schweitzer gazed through a microscope in her laboratory at north carolina state university and saw lifelike tissue that had no business inhabiting a fossilized dinosaur skeleton fibrous matrix stretchy like a wet scab on human skin what appeared to be supple bone cells their three dimensional shapes intact and translucent blood vessels that looked as if they could have come straight from an ostrich at the zoo
6258967 by all the rules of paleontology such traces of life should have long since drained from the bones
6258968 fossils have richer stories to tell about the lub dub of dinosaur life than we have been willing to listen to
6258969 i invite the reader to step back and contemplate the obvious
6258970 this discovery gives immensely powerful support to the proposition that dinosaur fossils are not millions of years old at all but were mostly fossilized under catastrophic conditions a few thousand years ago at most
6258971 for i know the plans i have for you declares the lord plans to prosper you and not to harm you plans to give you hope and a future
6258972 funny how only we knew about it in 1992 but it was drawn that way back about 2000 years ago id say thats more verification of these stones and thus man and dinosaur coexisting
6258973 these inca stones have an extra bit of varnish on top of the engravings this means that the original engravings had to have been done about 2000 years ago or that the farmer has found a way to cheat time
6258974 this story reminds me of the foundations of a 5000 year old foundry unearthed by an american farmer the government stepped in bulldozed the site and threatened him with jail time or worse if he dared to expose it to public view ever again
6258975 i invite the reader to step back and contemplate the obvious
6258976 rhetoric like this has put schweitzer at the center of a raging cultural controversy because she is not just a pioneering paleontologist but also an evangelical christian
6258977 the best way to understand the glory of the world is to open your eyes and take an honest look at what is out there
6258978 the lady allows scientific observation to teach her rather than blindly following darwinist dogma
6258979 biofilms what now argument by definition lame argument by definition commonly used in evolutionary logic argument by definition can be extremely effective here the instructor defines a set s to be whatever biological systems satisfy some property for instance s might consist of all irreducibly complex molecular machines that are the result of darwinian evolution the lecturer then announces that in the future only members of s will be the focus of discussion even honors students will take this at face value not questioning whether the set s might in fact be empty
6258980 criatividade consiste no total rearranjo do que sabemos com o objetivo de descobrir o que n o sabemos
6258981 knowing where offenders like pedophiles are does not mean you know what they are doing
6258982 treating people like pieces of meat does not seem to represent an improvement in the system to me
6258983 many commentators anchor themselves in the familiar present and exploiting the latest fashion and a series of telling anecdotes merely tell people what is already happening
6258984 much of what we have to say with regard to both continuities and discontinuities does not have a conclusion or ending happy or otherwise because self evidently the future has not happened yet
6258985 likely to be employed to manage knowledge and support decision making across government and commercial sectors
6258986 the world would be better or at least no worse in the future than it is today
6258987 if you had a magic cap to say are you good to go that might be valuable
6258988 if you can demonstrate their cognition changes as well as gets slowed down in some way then it would be very useful to have a tool to assess this
6258989 having a little black box telling them they may not to be able to do what theyve been training for may not go over well as you could imagine
6258990 as it stands its pretty much the only game in town for trying to monitor brain status
6258991 in the grand scheme of brain machine interfaces this is a complete paradigm change
6258992 this idea opens up all kinds of possibilities for how we interact with devices its not just about giving instructions but about those devices assisting us in a common goal you know the goal the computer knows the goal and you work together to solve the task
6258993 the status quo of brain machine interfaces that are out there have static and fixed decoding algorithms which assume a person thinks one way for all time
6258994 we learn throughout our lives and come into different scenarios so you need to develop a paradigm that allows interaction and growth
6258995 my neural implant made me do it i mean sure i thought about crushing my boss with that 2 ton metallic robot arm but i had no idea my neural implant would take me so seriously

6258998 this idea opens up all kinds of possibilities for how we interact with devices its not just about giving instructions but about those devices assisting us in a common goal you know the goal the computer knows the goal and you work together to solve the task
6258999 the status quo of brain machine interfaces that are out there have static and fixed decoding algorithms which assume a person thinks one way for all time
6259000 we learn throughout our lives and come into different scenarios so you need to develop a paradigm that allows interaction and growth
6259001 we think this dialogue with a goal is how we can make these systems evolve over time
6259002 we want these devices to grow with the user also we want users to be able to experience new scenarios and be able to control the device
6259003 its a clear demonstration of a methodology that will work in situations when other implementations would fall apart
6259004 encouraging the placement of rfids on young children even in this limited and questionable context can only have the unintended effect of acclimating them to being monitored by the government in other contexts and wherever they go as if it were perfectly normal and appropriate
6259005 the exact identity of the person or certain characteristics about the person can be determined through the use of this technology
6259006 this information is used to monitor the movement of the person through the store or other areas tracking information can be used to provide targeted advertising and to improve existing store systems and tracking systems
6259007 invisible tracking brings to mind science fiction inspired uses or even abuses such as unknowingly getting sprinkled with smart tag powder for big brother like monitoring
6259008 any entity which is radically smarter than human beings would also be very powerful
6259009 if we get something wrong you could imagine the consequences would involve the extinction of the human species
6259010 we want to preserve the best of what it is to be human and maybe even amplify that
6259011 we will begin to use science and technology not just to manage the world around us but to manage our own human biology as well
6259012 the changes will be faster and more profound than the very very slow changes that would occur over tens of thousands of years as a result of natural selection and biological evolution
6259013 the culmination of the merger of our biological thinking and existence with our technology resulting in a world that is still human but that transcends our biological roots
6259014 there will be no distinction post singularity between human and machine or between physical and virtual reality
6259015 we will increasingly become software entities if you go out enough decades
6259016 biology and health and medicine used to be hit or miss
6259017 it wasnt based on any coherent theory about how it works
6259018 nanotechnology will not just be used to reprogram but to transcend biology and go beyond its limitations by merging with non biological systems
6259019 if we rebuild biological systems with nanotechnology we can go beyond its limits
6259020 a more intelligent process will inherently outcompete one that is less intelligent making intelligence the most powerful force in the universe
6259021 any entity which is radically smarter than human beings would also be very powerful if we get something wrong you could imagine the consequences would involve the extinction of the human species
6259022 we want to preserve the best of what it is to be human and maybe even amplify that we will begin to use science and technology not just to manage the world around us but to manage our own human biology as well the changes will be faster and more profound than the very very slow changes that would occur over tens of thousands of years as a result of natural selection and biological evolution
6259023 maybe it will take eight years or 200 years it is very hard to predict
6259024 the culmination of the merger of our biological thinking and existence with our technology resulting in a world that is still human but that transcends our biological roots
6259025 there will be no distinction post singularity between human and machine or between physical and virtual reality
6259026 our brains are a million times slower than electronics we will increasingly become software entities if you go out enough decades
6259027 nanotechnology will not just be used to reprogram but to transcend biology and go beyond its limitations by merging with non biological systems if we rebuild biological systems with nanotechnology we can go beyond its limits
6259028 a more intelligent process will inherently outcompete one that is less intelligent making intelligence the most powerful force in the universe

6259032 nxps objective as the manufacturer of mifare classic chips is to transparently update all systems integrators and operators of infrastructures which use mifare classic in a timely manner so that they can take the appropriate measures to upgrade the security of their systems
6259033 different installations have different security requirements however it is not conceivable that they all will have their security upgraded to the necessary level in a period of months until this paper is published these upgrades will take up to a number of years
6259034 the judge has ruled that publishing this scientific article falls under the principle of freedom of expression and that in a democratic society it is of great importance that the results of scientific research can be published
6259035 in the opinion of the university the evidence based results of this research must find their way into the public sphere in order to achieve societal significance
6259036 i think its crucial that its published in an academic conference where researchers can work on solutions
6259037 designed around the concept of understanding biological sensory structures through advanced characterization and emulating or transferring this knowledge to the creation of superior synthetic sensors
6259038 will impact dod and national security by developing a rational and predictive basis for doing biological research to combat bioterrorism maintain healthy personnel and discover new vaccines and medicines
6259039 will develop and demonstrate an extremely small less than 7 5 cm ultra lightweight less than 10 grams air vehicle system with the potential to perform indoor and outdoor military missions the program will explore novel bio inspired conventional and unconventional configurations to provide the warfighter with unprecedented capability for urban mission operations
6259040 will pursue an integrated approach to the object recognition pathway in the brain this fundamental biological research will be accomplished using methods intentionally geared toward computational and modeling approaches that are amenable to hardware and software based implementations
6259041 create technologies that allow the warfighter to maintain peak physical and cognitive performance despite the harsh battlefield environment
6259042 novel pharmaceuticals that enhance neural transmission nutraceuticals that promote neurogenesis cognitive training and devices such as transcranial magnetic stimulation
6259043 continuously available on demand mission level training for all forces at all echelons specifically the program is developing in areas of high military importance new kinds of cognitive training systems that include elements of human tutor interactions and the emotional involvement of computer games coupled with the feedback of combat training center learning
6259044 are helping transform neuroscience from a laboratory discipline to one that is doing advanced research to deliver revolutionary capabilities important to our warfighters

6259053 alright were going to move away and have a day away from the network
6259054 thanks to this generous grant we can work with experts in automatic speech recognition and in brain imaging at other universities to research a brain computer interface with applications in military medical and commercial settings
6259055 such a system would require extensive training for anyone using it to send and receive messages
6259056 the investigation has already begun to uncover some disturbing facts that seem to belie the innocent picture of downstream brokerages you paint in your letter
6259057 for example some evidence indicates that fidelity was actively marketing auction rate securities to its high net worth clients

6259073 yet we have mr nelson and mr robb rowing exactly in the opposite direction
6259074 it is time the liberal and the national party the opposition sort out whether they have got any policy on this at all
6259075 that is a question best put to mr nelson and mr robb
6259076 we are going to have a good discussion today about fiji about climate change and about the big challenges for development in the region against the millennium development goals
6259077 as i said before the region has got huge challenges ahead of it and our job is to be long term positive partners with region not just in investing in the region but measuring improvements as well

6259085 my hope and expectation is that we are going to be able to build one of the best expanded convention centers anywhere and stay within our cost constraints
6259086 i dont want to speculate on the what if because we havent gotten to that point
6259087 well know a lot more in about three weeks when we are dealing with hard data
6259088 we certainly had both challenge and controversy people did give us a shot the end result is 51 2 years later this convention center is at a much different and better place
6259089 we cannot go fowrward weve simply got to pull the plug
6259090 this isnt just standing still if we dont build this addition

6259105 confidence that we can meet our insurance profit target for 2008 of around 20 per cent of net earned premium
6259106 the acquisitions converted to date have enabled us to use a portion of our excess capital
6259107 we are experiencing increased acquisition activity with opportunities being presented in many of the markets in which we operate
6259108 we expect to convert some of these opportunities to optimise our capital and returns to shareholders
6259109 at current exchange rates we now expect gross written premium to be around 12 5 billion and net earned premium to be around 10 8 billion for 2008

6259125 as ever with sonys cyber shot range the dsc w300 is as much about style as substance the metal build quality suggests this is a camera that youll still be using a few years down the line a feeling backed up by that whopping 13 megapixel resolution plus its plentifully large and bright rear lcd look back at a camera from four or five years ago when 1 5 inches was the norm and find a product looking positively prehistoric unfortunately though while images appear fine when viewed in isolation anyone who has handled a wide variety of digital compacts as us reviewers are privileged to do will discover that image quality is perhaps the least impressive aspect of the w300 thats a shame as among its bridge cameras im thinking of the h50 and dslrs alpha 350 at the mid range sony has delivered some surprisingly impressive photographic models of late all that being said noise is handled very well and shots do require a minimal amount of post processing out of the camera so in that respect the sony cyber shot dsc w300 could be said to be ideally suited to its target market of the undemanding snapper who requires visual aide memoirs delivered with the minimum of fuss

6259133 i see a lot of litter that accumulates over time
6259134 i think itll kind of give off a negative impression to be honest i just think that a lot of people when theyre coming to a city and you kind of have a big event you want to put your best foot forward
6259135 i guess it would be nice to see if the city took care of the sides of the roadways and clean that up especially with all the major visitors coming in

6259157 there was quite a bit of blood on his back parts my daughter checked him out and saw the stab wounds and at that point he just kind of collapsed into her arms
6259158 she was asking the other passengers for clothes and napkins and she put compression where he was bleeding on his back where the stab wounds were
6259159 as soon as they arrived they asked the people to move off the train so they could get to this man and help him

6259202 besides the fact that the ethanol tariff is perfectly in line with wto obligations it is also in line with our domestic energy policy which focuses on using homegrown ethanol to help rural communities across the country rather than sending more dollars to the middle east or brazil
6259203 brazil has yet to even take advantage of exporting ethanol duty free to the united states through the caribbean basin initiative until brazil takes full advantage of its ability to export ethanol duty free i dont see why we should give brazilian ethanol more generous treatment

6259228 digital printing is the process by which printed materials are produced on a laser printer ink jet printer or dye sub printer digital printing is different from traditional printing methods like offset printing in that there is no transfer of ink from a printing plate to the paper your desktop inkjet printer at home is considered a form of digital printing albeit a primitive form digital printers generally use toner instead of ink so colors arent quite as vibrant on a digital printer its important to know the basics about digital printing for any kind of printing you do from poster printing to brochure printing digital printing is usually cheaper than offset printing so knowing what kind of projects you can use digital printing for can save you money when you should use digital printing generally you should consider using digital printing when you have a small print job of less than 100 pieces you dont have to pay for the set up fees that are associated with offset printing and you most likely wont need the printer to save what would have been your printing plate when you print small jobs a small run of 50 dinner menus in black ink will cost about 300 less if you print them digitally rather than traditionally you should also use digital printing for text only projects if you have color photos in your brochures youd be better off with offset printing digital printers can certainly print color photos but the photos wont be as sharp and the colors wont be as saturated as they would be with an offset printer photo considerations if you have a small print job you can try to find a printer with a di direct imaging press these small digital presses use ink instead of toner the downside of using this kind of press is that you cant print items that are bigger than approximately 14

6259257 we oppose the appointment of kurtzer because of his long documented record of hostility to and severe pressure upon israel
6259258 with jews like kurtzer it is impossible to build a healthy relationship between israel and the united states
6259259 frequently pressured israel to make one sided concessions to the arabs he constantly blamed israel for the absence of mideast peace and paid little or no attention to the fact that the palestinians were carrying out terrorist attacks and openly calling for the destruction of israel
6259260 kurtzer will use his jewishness as a protective cover for his anti israel views
6259261 possibly more than any other u s state department official kurtzer has been instrumental in promoting the goals of the palestinians and in raising their afflictions to the center of the u s policymakers agenda

6259394 hey man mind if i join you you have an extra cigarette
6259395 you wont believe what happened to me the other night so i went to the bodega to get a pack of cigarettes while my friend was picking up chinese food around the corner im standing in line right and i can clearly feel this dude behind me reach into my pocket and grab my wallet i turn around and start to flip out at the guy some cracked out asshole motherfucker just staring at me like who me guy behind the counter started to get involved started yelling and screaming and pointing for this guy to get the fuck out of his store so he finally sidles outta there like he didnt do nothing wrong and were the crazy ones i buy my cigarettes and im on my way
6259396 yeah but thats not all so my friends got the chinese food ive got my cigarettes everythings hunky dory and were walking home and the same dude walks up to us and he asks us for change and then he asks me for a cigarette and im like dude go fuck yourself you just tried to rob me 10 seconds ago and you know what he says come on dog you know id have your back i mean are you fucking kidding me youd have my back you just tried to fucking take my wallet
6259397 we want to be there so that people who have somehow found a ride to go vote can get their flu vaccine while theyre there
6259398 if youve got somebody waiting to get vaccinated whose car is sitting out in the lot that was the only concern we had
6259399 but the health department has been very good about taking those things into account
6259400 were looking for sites that are large enough so that we will not be in the way
6259401 oh no that son of a bitch how dare he say or write in such a manner who does he think he is oh how dare he how dare he use such language i am so offended
6259402 the boy had been pranking around in the garden having a competition with his cousin when they were breaking wind and lighting it right behind him was a petrol can and that just flashed
6259403 i think he must have won the competition but he will have some nasty burns now
6259404 it is a warning not to mess around with fire
6259405 god he must feel lower than the white line in the road
6259406 he is having a good time which i think our sport sorely needs to see people enjoying themselves having a good time
6259407 theres a little bit of pressure in trying to pick a school
6259408 the location is a factor its like five minutes from my house the coach is a hall of famer and johnny flynn will probably head to the nba after the season so that will open up a spot for me
6259409 its a school that allows me to play the point and off the ball everybody on the court for them can pass and dribble and theyre on top of the big east every year
6259410 they have a hall of fame coach and the competition at the guard spot will make me a better player
6259411 theyre an up and coming school i feel its a place where i can make a name for myself theyve had good recruiting classes lately and i feel i can be a part of making them better
6259412 ill be fine whatever school it is ill come in early and do summer school and start to get ahead i just want to come in and work on my game and study im not a guy that parties a lot anyway
6259413 he just tells me about his experiences and the coaches
6259414 we believe we can make specific energy saving recommendations based on your situation that are far more valuable than any of the general tips on websites
6259415 the most potent driver of change is beating your neighbors
6259416 imagine if your daily consumption were part of your facebook page and broadcast to your friends by rss feed
6259417 youd work harder to conserve so you dont look like a jackass in front of your peers
6259418 from what the meter manufacturers say the volumes will ramp up next year
6259419 thats going to work out pretty good for us if it was happening right now at this moment wed feel a little bit behind were not quite ready
6259420 est adoptando esas decisiones no porque no ame a estados unidos sino porque cree que no tiene importancia si estados unidos gana o pierde
6259421 post up in which i took part i weighed in on the urban fantasy genre and i tried my hand at a bit of prophesy also participating are
6259422 weve got to produce our own oil and gas right here in our country
6259423 sharp turnarounds for a man who has made the expansion of renewable energy a cornerstone of his career
6259424 a clear shift from his previous opposition to such measures
6259425 not every place that can support oil drilling should be drilled
6259426 theres a lot of things you dont know about me dottie im a drifter dottie a loner
6259427 tell me where it is before i lose patience with you francis
6259428 everyone i know has a big but come on simone talk about your big but
6259429 i look forward to letting them know whats going on
6259430 the interim government should have attended to account to forum leaders
6259431 but there is much that must be done both in and beyond the judicial system
6259432 a real worry is the knowledge that some victims will not come to the criminal courts to give evidence because of fear and equally they look askance at the family court because of the uneven standard of security we can and must do better
6259433 there are currently 30 patients in isolation at dunedin hospital and three wards are closed to admissions at the hospital
6259434 we are going to continue with some outpatient clinics and procedures tomorrow at dunedin hospital
6259435 the majority of clinics operating will be in areas where physical isolation from the wards can be maintained
6259436 we are starting to increase the number of services that we can provide based on assessment of the clinical urgency of the cases and our ability to continue with our isolation protocols
6259437 however we urge all visitors and patients who do come to the hospital to abide by our hand hygiene enforcements if they do need to be in the hospital
6259438 so i took a glimpse of montana now nothing else matters ill heal eventually how i adore you dory previn turned you up to eleven for the bands ears to bleed i cant see what he once meant to me do you think its time i put it out of my mind i cant see what he once meant to me do you think its time i put him out of my mind i think its time i let my love for him die
6259439 we are pleased to complete the acquisition of sgx and are excited to bring the scientific and technological expertise of sgx into lillys research organization
6259440 we will leverage the combined resources of both companies to strengthen our structural biology capabilities and seek out innovative therapies for patients
6259441 the future of computing and consumer devices is increasingly visual and bandwidth intensive
6259442 lifestyles filled with high definition media and digital audio demand quick and universal data transfer usb 3 0 is an answer to the future bandwidth need of the pc platform amd believes strongly in open industry standards and therefore is supporting a common xhci specification
6259443 somebody must have spilled peppercorns i keep stepping on them
6259444 kelly what in the f k did you do to my radio who listens to that crap
6259445 jesus on a stick i cant believe you girls watch that s t im going to manland
6259446 do i look like i just fell off a turnip truck
6259447 cms goal for updating and enhancing the hospital compare web site is to provide usable and accurate information about hospital performance to providers and communities that will encourage hospitals to excel in the quality of care they provide
6259448 with these new enhancements consumers and health care providers will be able to look at individual hospital mortality scores we hope that this new information will cement the web sites role as a key driver in improving the quality and reliability of care in the nations hospitals
6259449 people in the general public look at mortality or survival rate as being a very key indicator
6259450 and pneumonia heart attack and heart failure are three areas in which we have national agreement in how to define measure and report outcomes
6259451 its great to know how you are doing you need to know how youre doing so you can do better
6259452 in the short run it will allow the hospital to look more carefully at their own data and improve things but for individual patients who want to choose their own care it can be more misleading than helpful
6259453 it is a good way to get the process going but it is not enough and not the right type of information
6259454 we are still in the early stages of this process
6259455 it is a bit hard to digest for the average consumer
6259456 we have been working with cms for five or six years to come up with measures that people could trust
6259457 but one thing that is true is that no one sees this measure as a means to select hospital when critically ill
6259458 we think that putting this information out and clearly communicating it to hospitals and their boards means that people have to look at their performance it is a tool to understand how you are doing
6259459 i do hope that it empowers groups of patients and community groups and hospital boards to engage in a conversation with their institution they really need to be held accountable
6259460 the mccain campaign believes that some of hillary clintons tactics especially questioning whether obama is ready to lead can be a real winner
6259461 the mccain team has been very open that they went to school on the hillary clinton campaign that they learned from that
6259462 and on this 3 a m ad whats very striking as some have pointed out over the last few days is that barack obama was winning a steady streak of victories against hillary clinton
6259463 and then she ran that ad and she really went on the attack on the experience question and she won the bulk of the primaries thereafter in the closing months of the democratic primaries and won 500 000 more votes than he did and almost took it away from him
6259464 which candidate do voters believe is better qualified to deal with russia mccain by better than 2 1
6259465 going after more centrist voters more swing voters more conservative voters who will be a much bigger deal in the general election than they were in those primaries and caucuses
6259466 not only did the clinton campaign give mccain and his advisers a road map but they actually started the mccains down that path
6259467 thats why youre hearing from obama very specific policy oriented proposals here
6259468 theres not a lot of that kind of flash if you will from the earlier days
6259469 the big question now is whether obama can successfully regain control of the campaign agenda as we head into the democratic convention
6259470 what the clinton campaign demonstrated is when you bring obama back down to earth its a better battle
6259471 the rapid rise in fuel costs since december last year is unprecedented and the impact has been felt across the aviation industry and the world economy
6259472 we understand the level of scrutiny we are being subjected to at present
6259473 so when they continued asking him he lifted up himself and said unto them he that is without sin among you let him first cast a stone at her
6259474 1 jesus went unto the mount of olives 2 and early in the morning he came again into the temple and all the people came unto him and he sat down and taught them 3 and the scribes and pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery and when they had set her in the midst 4 they say unto him master this woman was taken in adultery in the very act 5 now moses in the law commanded us that such should be stoned but what sayest thou 6 this they said tempting him that they might have to accuse him but jesus stooped down and with his finger wrote on the ground as though he heard them not 7 so when they continued asking him he lifted up himself and said unto them he that is without sin among you let him first cast a stone at her 8 and again he stooped down and wrote on the ground 9 and they which heard it being convicted by their own conscience went out one by one beginning at the eldest even unto the last and jesus was left alone and the woman standing in the midst 10 when jesus had lifted up himself and saw none but the woman he said unto her woman where are those thine accusers hath no man condemned thee 11 she said no man lord and jesus said unto her neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more
6259475 31 then said jesus to those jews which believed on him if ye continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed 32 and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free 33 they answered him we be abrahams seed and were never in bondage to any man how sayest thou ye shall be made free 34 jesus answered them verily verily i say unto you whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin 35 and the servant abideth not in the house for ever but the son abideth ever 36 if the son therefore shall make you free ye shall be free indeed
6259476 37 in the last day that great day of the feast jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink 38 he that believeth on me as the scripture hath said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water
6259477 good afternoon if you are lonely man then i was not mistaken that has written to you if you are not lonely man who searches for love and serious relations then do not answer this letter i search for love husband serious relations i do not search for time relations and game i hope that you are that man who is necessary for me i hope that you are that man with whom i will be ready to live all life i wish to care about cosiness and comfort of husband and family i wish to be for my husband the best friend cooker keeper of a home mistress mother of his children i hope that i ask a little from a life i am russian woman i am 30 years i am school teacher and dancing master if you like my photo and you search for serious relations then write to me on my personal e mail sweetsiberianwoman gmail com yours faithfully elmara
6259478 throughout the course of the day and into this evening
6259479 the key idea in power management is quite simple to shut things off when not in use
6259480 as the number of cores in cpus increases the demand for more and more memory inside microprocessors grows dramatically making sure that we can continue to grow memory on microprocessors is a basic requirement for scaling
6259481 we can continue the scaling or miniaturization of the circuits for several more generations there is still a lot more room for development
6259482 this is a good move for intel and its good for customers that intel is making the move
6259483 it will speed development of solid state drive ssd technology and drop the cost smaller pc manufacturers will be able to buy pre integrated ssd drives that will seamlessly slide right into current laptop and desktop designs which means no additional redesign or development cost
6259484 on the plus side they are faster smaller and can take less power they arent mechanical and are thus more reliable than regular hard drives
6259485 the downside is that currently they are more expensive over time the price of ssds will come down but i believe most users will eventually have systems that utilize both ssds and traditional hard drives a decent sized ssd will give a speed boost while the regular hard drive will store the bulk of the data
6259486 while sequential market growth is unusual in the second quarter of the calendar year its clear that in the second quarter of 2008 intels pc processor shipments drove the growth
6259487 intels processor shipments alone grew nearly 4 3 per cent quarter over quarter and 20 8 per cent year over year while amds processor shipments were about flat
6259488 while processor unit shipments exceeded our forecast in q2 08 intels aggressive approach to the market through both product and pricing points to a major supply side variable
6259489 however economic concerns cause us to maintain our conservative outlook for the second half of the year
6259490 if thats not a hostile work environment i dont know what is
6259491 see thats exactly the nasty and hostile behavior i had to put up with every day
6259492 kalau barang papa belikan dua atau tiga bulan akan rusak tapi kalau buku papa belikan dia akan abadi dalam diri kalian
6259493 absent mindedness is a factor in 44 of all car collisions with drivers much more likely to crash due to their own inattention than from speeding fatigue and alcohol combined
6259494 the big cache and six cores will give customers a nice bump in performance
6259495 it looks like at least from the benchmarks were seeing that six core chips offer more performance than quad cores so yes customers are going to want them what we dont know is how much power the chips consume and how much heat they will dissipate and those are key concerns but all in all this is a pretty big advance in the state of the art and all the major vendors are on board
6259496 these chips outperform anything amd has and probably win on price performance too this could cut amds share of the server market considerably
6259497 intel doesnt have to crank up chip performance right now to thwart amd
6259498 their current products handily outperform amd on server products from my own research i can tell you that x86 server customers have moved away from amd and towards intel so intel didnt need to release this stuff now to catch up to amd or to top them but theyre doing it anyway just to keep the pressure up on amd and on themselves
6259499 if software cant take advantage of it what does it buy you
6259500 you still have software partitioning issues and when you put more cores on a chip you have to run it slower or increase the power consumption budget or thermal limitations
6259501 if you look at amds business its been heavily consumer oriented
6259502 part of it has to do with their legacy as the scrappy start up theyve been focused more on the consumer market because the consumer market is relatively fast changing and much more flexible about what platforms they use its easier to get into but for amd to maximize its sales it needs to have a strong presence in the consumer and business sector
6259503 it is often said that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and we certainly see that in play here but at another level it is somewhat annoying when you see the over the top rhetoric they utilize and at some level you get mad
6259504 i think he would do for senator obama what lyndon johnson did for john kennedy hes got serious foreign policy experience a long and distinguished senate resume and he is one of the most effective surrogates that senator obama has right now who can go toe to toe with any republican on any issue at any time
6259505 not something that lends itself to on the job training

6259512 looming uncertainty over the shape of the global carbon markets after 2012 and the effects of the credit crunch are contributing to a slowing down of new capital joining the carbon market
6259513 in most other asset classes 63 percent growth in assets under management would be a pretty good story but the 100 percent plus growth in carbon markets between 2006 and 2007 has outpaced growth in carbon funds
6259514 the entry of the u s into the global carbon markets will be game changing and while a successor to kyoto is going to be tough to negotiate pressure is building on the international community to act decisively on climate change
6259515 and second i would like to say that usb has not won
6259516 like im so like fabulous now im so glamorous now but i really didnt feel like that when i was a kid at all it was really hard
6259517 you are responsible for youre own happiness make the best of things
6259518 you can wear your heart on your sleeve but make sure it wears a full metal jacket
6259519 when youre injured you cant make any excuses because its pretty much out of our hands
6259520 no basketball player wants to be injured im just really upset that this occurred but its part of the game and i just have to deal with it
6259521 i was more concerned with his knee and then when mine started bothering me i asked him a few questions just to make sure it was different
6259522 ive just got to hope that nothing else comes up

6259525 finally you must consider the tax consequences of investing especially in taxable accounts generally the most tax efficient way to use your different accounts is our thanks to taylor larimore and david grabiner for this list
6259526 i was so happy that the picture was a great success just as successful as going my way actually the bells of st marys made even more money than its predecessor and that david was completely wrong
6259527 we believe that 95 percent is the minimally acceptable probability of success for a given initial withdrawal rate

6259536 corporate taxes are found to be most harmful for growth followed by personal income taxes and then consumption taxes
6259537 every month that goes by without tax reform america is a relatively less attractive place to do business
6259538 20 years ago the u s led the world in cutting the corporate tax rate to make our economy more conducive to job creation since then almost every other industrialized country has cut its corporate tax while the united states has stood still and as a result the u s corporate tax rate is now 50 higher than the oecd average
6259539 pero la mesa del ps en realidad siente su deber declarar que no comparte el hecho de que si bien repetimos es un mecanismo m s transparente porque se habla de litros porque la situaci n internacional est como est m s bien la tendencia es que suba y en esas condiciones se termina recibiendo una mayor asignaci n para poder cubrir el mayor costo de la bencina

6259541 we reached an agreement final decision with respect to moving ahead has not been made yet but we have an agreement with the umpires
6259542 were going to move forward with the understanding the sides will come to the table later and iron out some of the remaining issues
6259543 there can be no patriotism without permanent opposition and criticism
6259544 if that person happens to be among other things pro choice the party will support that
6259545 from the conservative perspective we are literally imploring you to not turn your back on your great pro life record over decades
6259546 senator lieberman can speak to whatever group he wants but its not going to change the fact that john mccain is a flawed candidate who is wrong on every issue facing the country
6259547 our convention will showcase a cross section of leaders who will highlight john mccains long commitment to putting our country first before self interest or politics
6259548 the speakers will address john mccains unmatched record of service and sacrifice for america and his vision for moving our nation forward to keep us safe and get our economy back on track
6259549 its completely absurd its character assassination its disgraceful from top to bottom how do you respond to this kind of gutter snipe politics
6259550 seemed to be calibrating policy in a way that happened to benefit ultimately himself and special interests
6259551 i think its fair to assume his views are coloured by his own personal financial stake

6259565 a lot of them dont really like to burn so theyre only going to burn when theyre going to be changing crops or where they have a specific need
6259566 its just a few more hoops to jump through but for the environment and for health issues air quality i think its a good thing
6259567 what wed like to have is have the smoke go straight up 5 to 8 thousand feet and then be carried away
6259568 if you end up with polluntants in the air children and seniors end up breathing those and they get down inside the lungs and they can be quite harmful

6259571 so many people came out and pulled together it was really amazing
6259572 from the day schumers letter was made public on june 26 until the closure of the bank a run on the bank took place and the failure became inevitable
6259573 it certainly raises eyebrows that the firm promoting this letter is the same outfit that fueled the swift boat attacks and does work for the rnc
6259574 were seeing tremendous growth in video and games among thumbplays customers
6259575 this growth is occurring for two reasons the content is extremely engaging and the mobile experience on a huge range of phones is exceptionally good in terms of content creation player x is as good as it gets and we couldnt be more proud to have them in our ever growing family of incredibly talented partners
6259576 for us this is the perfect partnership we make great content and thumbplay makes sure millions and millions of people have access to it
6259577 what is more they consistently deliver a great customer experience as a result i cant think of any organization as well suited to being our first direct to consumer partner
6259578 24 7 365 customer service and a commitment to delivering the largest catalog of entertainment possible

6259582 recently giving host angelea walkup an opportunity to get a close up look at the police operations that apparently focuses on providing a mobile petting zoo for the communitys children
6259583 if we are contacted to participate in this investigation we certainly will and want to let the people know that this is not the end of the investigation it is only some initial questioning and rocky will be cleared should they proceed
6259584 i will let no one question my love of this country
6259585 challeng ed the republican to acknowledge that they can disagree without maligning each other
6259586 joint fund raising dinners allow donors to write a single big check that then gets divided between the mccain campaign and either the republican national committee or any number of state committees that co host the events
6259587 the investigation has already begun to uncover some disturbing facts that seem to belie the innocent picture of downstream brokerages you paint in your letter
6259588 for example some evidence indicates that fidelity was actively marketing auction rate securities to its high net worth clients
6259589 fidelity does not actively market these securities and does not offer special financial incentives to representatives if they sell these securities
6259590 deliberately stuck their heads in the sand but continued to actively market these products to unknowing investors that will certainly be relevant to our calculus of the firms culpability
6259591 take full appropriate measures against any firms or individuals who have violated securities laws and we fully support them in their efforts
6259592 whether california faces good or challenging economic times we must always make public safety our number one priority if our streets parks and schools arent safe from gang violence and other crimes then nothing else really matters
6259593 as you would expect we have been in communication with the companies for months to receive updates and weve been communicating with their regulator and the federal reserve
6259594 we continue to be concerned about what dilution would be required to stabilize fannie and freddie and what that would leave over for existing shareholders
6259595 it could be something like a convertible preferred deal that might end up diluting shareholders but at the same time the rest of the capital structure winds up doing ok
6259596 the market sees that takeover as further illustrating the guarantee of the government
6259597 what mudd didnt say is that the company is too leveraged to a depreciating asset housing and losses are off the charts and there are no signs of stability

6259638 teachers are not thinking they are acting robotically doing whatever they are told and then going home things are just really bad here
