5540000 there was less blood loss with this procedure than with conventional surgery and there is the potential for a faster recovery
5540001 the results were outstanding and suggest the robot assisted surgery is an attractive option for fistulas that would normally require abdominal surgery
5540002 robot assisted surgery has promise to bridge the limitations of laparoscopic surgery and allow more women with fistulas urinary incontinence or prolapsed pelvic organs to benefit from a minimally invasive approach
5540003 the number of times that a physician will deal with a surrogate decision maker is growing as our population ages and conditions such as alzheimers disease become more common the issue of how physicians interact with surrogates is a very important one we found that physicians often want to take an active role in determining what is right for a patient and often grapple with the needs of the patient versus those of the surrogate
5540004 i always think its important that its not a decision that the family member or the surrogate is making for themselves but it is a decision that they are making for someone else based upon their best knowledge of what that person would want
5540005 when i feel strongly that the patients quality of life is really poor then i do feel that it is appropriate for the physician to try and guide the family member toward a decision
5540006 if the patient cant make the decision then i discuss it with the family i sometimes will push the family to do what i think is best for the patient
5540007 i think family burden is an issue i dont think it should govern what the final decision is but i do think it should be addressed
5540008 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
5540009 the individual is handicapped by coming face to face with a conspiracy so monstrous he cannot believe it exists
5540010 the world is witnessing a terrible human rights crime in gaza where a million and a half human beings are being imprisoned with almost no access to the outside world an entire population is being brutally punished
5540011 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
5540012 the individual is handicapped by coming face to face with a conspiracy so monstrous he cannot believe it exists

5540014 saya memotret di kebun saat hendak mengganti lensa kameranya terlepas dari tanganku aku mencoba menadah dengan kaki agar kameranya tak jatuh terlalu keras ke lantai tapi hal itu justru menjadikan kamera tertendang jauh

5540020 in an age when genetic engineering of the human person is a distinct possibility the challenges our society faces in bioethics have never been more pressing
5540021 the medical school and i have long recognized the importance of bioethics for patient centered care responsible research and technological progress im very pleased that with the generous support of wally and mona wu and the university were now in a position to become nationally prominent in this field
5540022 developments in medicine and biotechnology create an acute need for more advanced education in bioethics
5540023 wake forest is perfectly suited to filling this need with our unique combination of strengths in life sciences the professions and the humanities
5540024 the course of study is designed to assist professionals in deepening their knowledge and understanding of bioethics in order to enhance practice in a variety of fields related to health care delivery and biomedical research
5540025 this pathogen has spread to all the oceans of the world and is resistant to many antibiotics
5540026 no one has seen such a rapid triggering of autophagy before
5540027 treating the human cells with an autophagy inhibitor halted the protein breakdown process but did not save the cells because v para uses other pathways by which to kill cells
5540028 however because it can kill by several routes its important to understand all of them
5540029 weve received a wake up call that this is important environmentally and we want to understand at the molecular level how this pathogen infects kills and persists
5540030 there are people getting sick from this emerging pathogen in the united states yet there is no major effort to understand its pathology
5540031 there are many ways to kill a cell and weve discovered yet another one the bacterium hijacks activities from us and deregulates them its like a bulldozer
5540032 im angry so much that i want to get revenge
5540033 its just like living in iraq terrorist town thats how i see it bunch of terrorists here
5540034 these types of cowardly acts are hideous and there are a lot of community members that are fed up with it
5540035 people are saying what can we do to make it right
5540036 it is up to us the four nations people we need to work together to come up with long term solutions against the gangs the drugs and the violence but our community has to take charge
5540037 youve got a right to the same share that every man here does
5540038 faith is getting stronger each day and her personality is very strong

5540047 if wishes were horses discursive comments on attempts to prevent individuals from being unfairly burdened by their reference classes
5540048 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
5540049 the only satisfactory description of uncertainty is probability by this i mean that the calculus of probabilities is adequate to handle all situations involving uncertainty probability is the only sensible description of uncertainty and is adequate for all problems involving uncertainty all other methods are inadequate anything that can be done with fuzzy logic belief functions upper and lower probabilities or any other alternative to probability can better be done with probability

5540056 jag ska inte d nyfiken utan jag vill vara med om saker och ting
5540057 what really impressed me with this property and the rme team was the amount of information that was available to me before i actually clicked on a property i had all my due diligence done for me right there on the website
5540058 we know what its like to follow a real estate agent around with our children in the back seat of the car making multiple offers and being refused multiple times we dont have the time to do that so its wonderful to leverage other peoples time and expertise
5540059 we always knew we should be doing something in real estate for the long term but didnt have a clue as to how to get started after being involved in nouveau riche and attending the training seminars we decided to take the plunge and buy that first property it was kind of scary to click on the button but we knew we had to start somewhere it went very well rme made the whole process go very smoothly
5540060 when you can take advantage of someone else going out and providing the deals the way they do its awesome
5540061 its so easy anyone can do it were looking forward to doing it over and over again
5540062 the concierge found the property for me with just a click of a mouse there it is they also found the mortgage company they found my lease option tenant they did all the work and we were able to close in our own living room
5540063 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
5540064 i dread to think what it would be like to have tyrell and another rookie back there with what we have ahead of us
5540065 it means so much to us to have sharper in our secondary with all the experience he has plus the experience he has in this scheme
5540066 its put a little more on him because he has to communicate more than he had to when madieu was here or when he was with another safety hes handled it well and hopefully it wont take away from his game because were asking him to do a little bit more from a verbal communication standpoint but i think he can handle it
5540067 he showed this past weekend that he can play his game and still help us with the young safety
5540068 he made a heck of a play on an interception and he did a great job covering a punt
5540069 he broke through two guys who were really holding him he just refused to be blocked
5540070 i am pleased this bill has been signed into law
5540071 this bill provides safeguards to better protect our children from lead phthalates and choking hazards
5540072 for several years the congressionally mandated rural health care initiative provided added support for quality health care at white river junction va medical center
5540073 the new resource center will build on this expertise deepening the medical centers commitment to bringing quality health care to veterans no matter where they live this is another constructive step forward to help bring these services to veterans in and near vermont
5540074 it is no secret that many rural veterans have a difficult time accessing the va health benefits they have earned through their service this new program at white river junction will help us develop the innovative solutions we need so that every veteran gets access to the care he or she deserves
5540075 with republicans fighting relentlessly on behalf of the american people for real energy reform its clear that the democratic leadership has finally recognized this is an issue they cannot ignore americas schools small businesses workers and families are crying out for relief as high gas prices squeeze their budgets and strain our economy unfortunately the democrats newfound interest in energy policy is marked by rhetoric not real action
5540076 if the speaker was truly interested in allowing congress to vote on a plan to put our nation on the path to energy independence we would have taken up the american energy act the all of the above plan put forward by congressional republicans instead democrats gave themselves a five week vacation and told the american people they would just have to wait when it comes to energy reform democrats have quite simply failed to lead
5540077 the forges health has been wrecked by too many chemicals and other forms of pollution and decisive action is needed
5540078 save the forge river has been an outstanding partner in this vital effort and i am grateful for this honor from them the forge has been crying out for help and because of the communitys efforts all the way to the united states capitol people are listening
5540079 congressman bishop has been one of the best friends to the forge river
5540080 not only did he help lead the way to get the federal government involved in protecting the forge river he even got personally involved by participating in our cleanup we will bring the forge river back to health and one of the main reasons why is congressman tim bishop

5540082 langsung bertaubat dari dosa merupakan keharusan yang tak bisa ditunda tunda jika taubat ditunda ia akan memunculkan durhaka lain akibat penundaan itu
5540083 kecuali orang orang yang bertaubat beriman dan mengerjakan amal shalih maka kejahatan mereka diganti dengan kebaikan dan adalah allah maha pengampun lagi maha penyayang
5540084 jika kamu menampakkan sedekah mu maka itu adalah baik sekali dan jika kamu menyembunyikannya dan kamu berikan kepada orang orang fakir maka menyembunyikan itu lebih baik bagi kamu dan allah akan menghapuskan dari kamu sebagian kesalahan kesalahanmu dan allah mengetahui apa yang kamu kerjakan
5540085 sedekah itu mematikan melebur kesalahan dan takwa itu membunuh kesalahan seperti air memadamkan api
5540086 yaitu kamu beriman kepada allah dan rasul nya dan berjihad di jalan allah dengan harta dan jiwamu
5540087 orang yang mati syahid akan diampuni dosanya pada percikan darah yang pertama dan akan dikawinkan dengan dua bidadari dan akan memberi syafaat tujuh puluh dari anggota keluarganya
5540088 barangsiapa yang berwudhu seperti wudhuku ini maka dosa dosanya yang terdahulu akan diampuni sedangkan shalatnya jalannya menuju masjid adalah amalan tambahan
5540089 barangsiapa yang pergi ke masjid untuk shalat berjamaah maka satu langkah bisa menghapus kesalahannya dan satu langkah yang lain ditulis sebagai kebaikan untuknya selama pergi dan pulang
5540090 begitulah perumpamaan shalat lima waktu dengan shalat itu allah akan melebur kesalahan kesalahan hamba nya
5540091 shalat lima waktu shalat jumat menuju jumat berikutnya adalah pelebur dosa di antara mereka selama dosa dosa besar tidak dilanggar
5540092 barangsiapa puasa ramadhan dengan iman dan ikhlas mencari pahala karena allah maka diampunilah dosanya yang sudah lewat
5540093 barangsiapa yang puasa ramadhan dan mengiringinya dengan puasa enam hari di bulan syawal maka ia akan keluar dari dosa dosanya seperti pada hari ia dilahirkan ibunya
5540094 dari setiap bulan tiga hari barangsiapa yang mampu melaksanakannya maka pahala setiap harinya bisa melebur sepuluh kali kesalahan dan dia bersih dari dosa seperti air membersihkan pakaian
5540095 barangsiapa yang melaksanakan haji lalu tidak berbicara kotor dan tidak fasik dia akan kembali diampuni dari dosanya sebagai mana ia dilahirkan ibunya
5540096 tidaklah menimpa seorang mukmin suatu kepayahan dan tidak pula penyakit yang langgeng tidak pula duka cita dan tidak pula kesusahan tidak pula penyakit dan tidak pula kesedihan sampai duri yang mengenai dirinya kecuali allah akan mengampuni kesalahannya dengan musibah itu
5540097 akhlak yang baik bisa menghancurkan kesalahan kesalahan sebagaimana matahari mencairkan es
5540098 tak ada dua orang islam yang saling bertemu lalu keduanya saling berjabat tangan kecuali allah akan mengampuni keduanya sebelum berpisah
5540099 doesnt allow drilling off california or the eastern coast of florida
5540100 just a few weeks ago the house speaker said republican calls for a vote just on drilling was a hoax on the american people
5540101 it is clearly mrs pelosi who is playing the rhetoric propaganda game with the american people and they are not buying it according to the latest rasmussen poll 61 percent of americans want congress to reconvene and lift the ban on offshore drilling moreover 67 percent said they believe the republicans are on the right side of the issue
5540102 if speaker pelosi is really serious about ending the partisan gridlock on energy policy she would end her book tour and call congress back to washington for a debate i have been to washington already during this break to speak out on energy policy and i am more than willing to head back speaker pelosi is the only person in america who can call the house back to session for an energy debate recently weve seen how tenuous americas global energy position is our reliance on foreign oil makes our country dependent on people like vladimir putin mahmoud ahmadinejad and hugo chavez which weakens americas national security it is time for speaker pelosi to use her power call the house in to session and begin a debate on long term energy policy i believe such a policy must increase american energy production increase alternatives and increase conservation

5540174 i did give documents a long time ago but these matters have been resolved for a long time now as far as im concerned
5540175 i have been trying hard to help my readers understand that fact that discrimination against women and attitudes of male chauvinism are continuing to hurt chinese women
5540176 as far as the root of the matter is concerned news media just stop short of condemning the traditional male chauvinism and womens inequality entrenched in chinese culture as if it is something we can do little about
5540177 compulsory sterilization or forced abortion adversely affects womens physical and mental health and infringes on the right of women to decide on the number and spacing of children
5540178 the shortage of women will have enormous implications on chinas social economic and development future the skewed ratio of men to women will have an impact on the sex industry and human trafficking
5540179 you murdered my mother and tried to murder my niece you caused this family nothing but pain and devastation
5540180 certainly we all feel horrible that the wrong person was initially found guilty by a jury for this crime
5540181 were thankful that justice was finally served and the real killer will spend the rest oh his life in prison
5540182 now the thing you have to realize about corporate taxes is that the statutory rate the rate you pay after being allowed deductions and all that means very little
5540183 a much better indicator is the amount of taxes corporations actually pay from oecd data behind a paywall i think unfortunately i get the following for percentage of gdp paid in corporate taxes in some major economies in 2005 canada 3 5 us 3 1 japan 4 3 france 2 8 germany 1 7 uk 3 4
5540184 the u s corporate tax what is it and where is it headed

5540196 this was an incredibly balanced and well thought out and complete decision and i am amazed that any person can listen to all we heard in the court and reach that decision in 24 hours
5540197 its got nothing to do with envy or desire its the recognition that building a home is one of lifes great adventures
5540198 and its an adventure were all capable of doing or at least wanting to do no matter where we are

5540202 and thats the most exciting thing for me watching them go through this process of change this almost redemptive experience it shows that human beings are capable of so much more than they sometimes suspect

5540209 time will tell if the company will keep its promises if so it will be a new day for forestry in humboldt county and truly an end to the timber wars as we knew them

5540212 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of currency the banks and corporations that grow up around them will deprive the people of thier homes until their children wake up homeless on the contenent their fathers conquered
5540213 our great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit our system of credit is privately concentrated the growth of the nation therefore and all our activities are in the hands of a few men who necessarily by very reason of their own limititaions chill and check and destroy genuine economic freedom we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated govts in the civilized world no govt by free opinion no longer a govt by conviction and the vote of the majority but a govt by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
5540214 a world banking system was set up here a superstate controlled by international bankers acting together to enslave the world for thier own pleasure the fed has usurped the government
5540215 it was a carefully contrived occurence international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair so that they might emerge the rulers of us all
5540216 as history has shown nothing is further from the truth
5540217 if you want to remain slaves of the bankers and pay for your own slavery let them continue to create money and control the nations credit
5540218 before 1933 the dollar bill read dollars in gold meaning that it was redeamable in gold after 1933 the dollar bill reads legal tender meaning that it is worthless paper
5540219 circulation gives it its value which means that the power to regulate its supply is the power to regulate its value power to bring us to our knees
5540220 give me control of a nations money supply and i care not who makes its laws
5540221 completely consistant w the fraudulant central banking model the country sought to escape from when it declared independance in the american revolutionary war
5540222 if you examined carefully the 16th amendment carefully you find that a sufficiant number of states never ratified that amendment
5540223 3 months of your wages literally goes into the pockets of the international bankers the fed res bank there is literally no statute no law in existence that requires you to pay this tax
5540224 i have not found that law i asked congress the irs commissioners they could not answer if they could answer then the american people are going to know that this whole thing is a fraud
5540225 the large banking interests were deeply interested in the war because of the wide opportunity for profits
5540226 what will americans do if germans sink an ocean liner with american passengers on board
5540227 i beleive that a flame of indignation would sweep the u s and that by itself would be sufficiant to carry us into war
5540228 we thought we would be completely booked about six months ago
5540229 i have colleagues who are disappointed with what the outcome has been we expected to be completely booked we are not
5540230 i was impressed by the quality of the craftsmanship but just as much by the fact that they were ardent union members and socialists and anarchists who were very committed to political and economic change
5540231 all these interests in my heritage labor activism and art all came together
5540232 i went up to him and said i wanted to do a documentary
5540233 i took a sabbatical from july to october 2006 when i did the bulk of the editing
5540234 i edited on vacation days and early in the morning and at night
5540235 you start out with a mass of material and you have to carve it down to the essentials so you can communicate to an audience
5540236 im excited to share the story of how these people managed to maintain their culture their politics and their art in a new place
5540237 they were suffering 90 percent fatalities from breathing the silica dust
5540238 it was only then that they could speak with a collective voice and compel the owners to install suction equipment
5540239 its going to be a different feel because were doing five days
5540240 its not going to change its not a family show were still going to be on after 9pm torchwoods a family show if you think its appropriate for your children to watch it we just deal with issues of life but no its not going to be toned down were still going to be edgy because thats what we are
5540241 gt dropped out to be in the doubtless crappy law and order uk but thats just me now what do you think
5540242 with all due respect to cardiff city theres only so many options in a place of that size for stories compared to a huge city like london
5540243 being promoted to bbc one and gaining a wider audience
5540244 we have handed the case to the police and also submitted our findings to our disciplinary board
5540245 for a long time people kind of got use to going to the doctors and filing a claim now its like we want the whole bill upfront
5540246 we are like any other business we have to collect our money to pay our bills its far easier to collect upfront than to go after someone on the back end
5540247 its reasonable to go an eye doctor on monday and then visit other doctors on wednesday and thursday and there will be an overpayment
5540248 they were the closest to us before the war and now they are the most frightening enemy
5540249 it feels like your own brother has cut off your head
5540250 after what happened it should be clear that they should have self determination
5540251 the reality is that for 15 years at least south ossetia and abkhazia have been independent in fact

5540261 an entire generation of developing world youth would be removed from the cockpit of religious fundamentalism presuming they dont make the hideous mistake of moving to the american bible belt and would be exposed to the irresistible distractions of sex drugs and rocknroll they would be won over forever to the light side of the force the enlightenment liberalism atheism sexual permissiveness punk rock disco dancing ice cream real ale books puppy dogs and all that good stuff

5540268 my husband greg and i are also victims to this unfortunate incident what i have been emailing and calling billie about since january was our leather bound photo album that they were supposed to put together for us as part of our package i never once received a phone call or email back
5540269 i didnt have wedding photos stolen from me by billies portraits but something just as dear to me the last photos from our daughters first year also we had ordered an album that was to include photos of all four sessions we never received it i hope no one else loses such precious memories
5540270 we were shocked we knew we were having a little trouble with them but we had now idea
5540271 are we all politicians in darjeeling hills every single individual is a politician
5540272 our demand is gorkhaland and we will discuss only that if other issues are brought before us we will stage a walk out
5540273 the cm has been talking about alternative arrangements instead of gorkhaland but we are adamant on our demand for a separate state and if the circumstances compel us we may even stage a walk out from the tripartite talks when held with the centre
5540274 despite being a 101 year old demand the state government is still adamant against conceding gorkhaland this reflects their apathy towards us but as a final measure we will call upon our soldiers policemen ex armymen to support our demand to shake the government
5540275 dooars siliguri terai and the bhaktinagar area are integral parts of gorkhaland they historically belong to us but if the government does not give it to us then we might forcibly snatch these places we will not leave behind these regions at any cost
5540276 weighing in at around 139kg the cat iii is built around an extruded aluminum spine which also serves as the fuel tank the 500cc three cylinder engine is quite complex its based on two 350cc honda twin cylinder engines mr kurth probably a talented engineer used three of the four honda cylinders to make his own 500cc triple the other notable thing about the cat is that both the front and the side wheels are steered with the latter turning in proportion to the tracking effect er no even we dont know what that means but it probably somehow adds to the vehicles stability and handling prowess the cat iii is fitted with tyres designed for the tyrell p34 six wheeled formula one car

5540302 random house made the decision to cancel its us publication of the novel the jewel of medina after much deliberation and with great reluctance
5540303 the decision was based on advice from scholars of islam among several creditable sources that publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community and could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
5540304 this is a work that absolutely stopped at nothing in order to desecrate something that all muslims hold sacred
5540305 firmly by our responsibility to support our authors and the free discussion of ideas even those that may be construed as offensive by some
5540306 however we must weigh that responsibility against others that it also bears and in this instance we decided not to go forward with this publication out of concerns for the author employees of random house booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the novel
5540307 womens empowerment never a popular theme among fundamentalists of any faith

5540322 kyna showed great maturity offensively tonight and great balance in all phases of the game
5540323 elena really stabilizes our ball control and has for three years she makes the great play when we need to have it and she continued that tonight
5540324 weve really focused on that and the number of digs we had tonight is indicative of the fact that were going to be able to control the ball and keep it off the floor we havent spent a lot of time on our offense yet so that portion of our game needs improvement but given that we havent spent much time focusing in team blocking our defense was great tonight
5540325 been there done that dont remember from being away often the weeds in my garden have grown taller than my plants now
5540326 this is a country that recognises and celebrates its indigenous people
5540327 our take is that grassroots small scale maori tourism operators give a more genuine experience for travellers
5540328 i came to whakarewarewa for a real experience indigenous cultures have a very strong link with the land and this is often overlooked
5540329 we felt part of their cultural performance it just felt more natural and friendly not like it was put on just for tourists
5540330 to be acknowledged in the lonely planet like that is a real bonus especially since our focus has always been on the people who live here
5540331 visitors are encouraged to see what real life is like in the village
5540332 i am so happy to go and live my religion
5540333 when i left my village i didnt think i would be here for 10 days

5540338 as far as im concerned they are jews they are as much jews as any other jew from ethiopia or new york
5540339 the lower manufacturing costs are now starting to flow through from the thailand factory these actual and forecasted savings are exceeding initial expectations
5540340 we are progressively reducing finished inventory levels which has resulted in lower production through our factories and impacted our economies of scale in the short term

5540347 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5540348 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5540349 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5540350 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5540351 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5540352 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5540353 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5540354 just wait youll pass them bs the doctors kept giveing us
5540355 la etapa anterior ha sido muy bonita maravillosa que pude compartir gracias a dios y m xico he manifestado que me he quedado con la conciencia tranquila
5540356 feliz de estar otra vez en la selecci n con un nuevo entrenador compa eros nuevos estoy ilusionado de hacer una grand sima eliminatoria y de mi parte aportar todo lo que pueda
5540357 es un tema que en m xico genera bastante pol mica el buen recibimiento que tuve en la primera convocatoria el recibimiento de mis compa eros y eso fue importante se habl m s afuera que adentro y ahora hay dos naturalizados conmigo es un tema que genera pol mica y tengo que respetar porque me siento cien por ciento mexicano
5540358 m s que pensar en el rival debemos estar unidos m s fuertes y con la ilusi n de clasificar al pr ximo mundial
5540359 la obligaci n cae sobre nosotros y estamos conscientes tenemos la obligaci n de empezar bien en casa y con nuestra gente empezar ganando sacar los primeros tres puntos
5540360 cuando entr a pitchear me sent a confiado de que bamos a ganar pero no imagin tal vez si tirar el juego perfecto pero no los doce ponches
5540361 si me imaginaba ser campe n del mundo y ser el h roe pero tirar juego perfecto un grand slam y los doce ponches fue incre ble
5540362 cuando entr a enfrentar los ltimos tres outs estaba muy motivado de tirar el juego perfecto cuando llevaba dos outs tir tres bolas ten a miedo de tirar recio ya que quer a poncharlo y baj el ritmo estaba muy cansado y termin muy emocionado
5540363 v a mi familia festejando siempre me han apoyado gracias a mis compa eros que me ayudaron bateando
5540364 comenzamos un poco presionados pero estos resultados nos han dado confianza el equipo ya se encuentra en ritmo eso es lo que esperamos para el torneo y ser campeones es lo que queremos lograr
5540365 no escuches ning n mal no hables ning n mal y no veas ning n mal

5540368 another reason im intrigued with the hanged of salem especially the women is that a number of them aroused suspicion in the first place because they were financially independent or sharp tongued or kept to themselves in other words they were killed off for the same sort of life i live right now but with longer skirts and fewer cable channels

5540370 bad times have a specific value these are occasions that a good learner would not miss
5540371 to be thrown upon ones own resources is to be cast into the very lap of fortune for our faculties then undergo a development and display of energy of which they were previously unsusceptible
5540372 much of your pain is the bitter potion by which the physician within you heals your sick self
5540373 its never the things that happen to you that upset you its your view of them
5540374 weve given up some points over the last few weeks so we need get back to business and work on padding our points lead
5540375 this is the second time were going back to bristol since the repave
5540376 and based upon our experience in the first race we found that bristol now has two good racing grooves and that may change the way the teams develop their strategy for the race
5540377 the second groove will lead to passing on both the inside and outside teams will try to take advantage of this and take a good look at setting their cars to run on the high side of the track
5540378 bristol always gives drivers a challenge especially if its their first experience there a high banked short track where laps clock at 15 seconds doesnt give a driver a chance to catch his breath
5540379 once the green flag drops they need to be up on the wheel for every lap unlike speedways where they may get a chance to catch their breath down the longer straightaways
5540380 and theres the added excitement that this race always brings
5540381 short track racing in front of 100 000 fans under the lights
5540382 looking for something they can count on they can depend on thats constant
5540383 usaha kerajaan perak untuk meringankan beban 400 pekerja disamping bantuan kijang care wajar dipuji serta dicontohi tindakan kilang tersebut membuang perkerjanya dengan notis 24 jam amatlah mengejutkan dan ternyata tidak bertanggungjawab saya menyeru agar tindakan dan langkah yang sewajarnya diambil
5540384 as a past driver you can watch the lines a driver is using in practice and suggest a different way around the track because you have an understanding of what the truck needs to do to go faster
5540385 a past driver also can give the crew chief different ideas
5540386 im always looking ahead on the racetrack and constantly aware of whats going on all over and on some days it is almost the same as sitting in the seat
5540387 anywhere the closing rate is fast things happen in a hurry
5540388 i am looking forward to running bristol for the first time i have received a lot of information about bristol so it should be quite interesting to see how it all applies when i get there
5540389 theyre short and you have to be able to watch everything at once
5540390 the spotters stand is in turn 1 and it makes it harder to see over to the turns on the opposite end of the track
5540391 from the spotters location you cant really tell how close other trucks are going away from you through the dogleg into turn 1 actually all of the superspeedways are difficult because of closing rates and how the trucks move from lane to lane down the backstretch
5540392 a year ago nobody really knew what to expect as bristol motor speedway finished one of the tracks most significant reconstruction projects
5540393 simply put the old bristol was gone what the week would bring was anyones guess
5540394 the nascar craftsman truck series was honored to be the first to test the track and did the drivers put on a show for the fans
5540395 where bristol used to be a bump and run kind of place where you pushed and shoved to advance the track architects produced compound banking with multiple grooves amazingly a fast driver could take the high line and make his passes without so much as scuffing his trucks paint
5540396 the race was won from the eighth starting position that was only the second time in 10 races that the winner started outside the top five
5540397 in one respect the track is the same old bristol making a truck handle remains a challenge to every crew chief
5540398 last year was interesting in another way johnny benson won the race with an engine that hadnt been rebuilt from earlier competition this factored into the decision to cut horsepower and give our owners the opportunity to reduce their costs
5540399 speaking of johnny hes truly on a roll one that doesnt come around very often being able to win four out of five races is pretty much unheard of in the nascar craftsman truck series greg biffle was the last to do so and that was in 2000
5540400 nobodys ever won four in a row something johnny has a chance to do this week some pretty impressive drivers have tried and failed biffle todd bodine ron hornaday jr and mike skinner champions all
5540401 so johnnys got his work cut out for him but the way the no 23 team is running he has a pretty good chance of making history
5540402 he was compelled as a matter of honour to turn up to the forum and explain himself to the leaders it is very disappointing that he wont turn up to effectively take his medicine
5540403 i think it speaks volumes that theyre not prepared to come and be accountable to forum leaders i think leaders are very keen to see the commitments that were made last time adhered to
5540404 its a bit exciting to be auctioned off as a date but its been three years since i last went on one so i have high expectations and am expecting to get swept off my feet
5540405 so where can i bid on a date with a hot dude
5540406 an invasion of ukraine by peacekeeping tanks is just a question of time
5540407 our data suggest that meditation practice can promote cortical plasticity in adults in areas important for cognitive and emotional processing and well being
5540408 these findings are consistent with other studies that demonstrated increased thickness of music areas in the brains of musicians and visual and motor areas in the brains of jugglers in other words the structure of an adult brain can change in response to repeated practice
5540409 the goal is to pay attention to sensory experience rather than to your thoughts about the sensory experience
5540410 for example if you suddenly hear a noise you just listen to it rather than thinking about it if your leg falls asleep you just notice the physical sensations if nothing is there you pay attention to your breathing
5540411 that the differences in brain structure were caused by the meditation rather than that differences in brain thickness got them into meditation in the first place
5540412 it reduces stress and increases my clarity of thought and my tolerance for staying focused in difficult situations
5540413 people who do it quickly realize that much of what goes on in their heads involves random thoughts that often have little substance
5540414 the goal is not so much to empty your head but to not get caught up in random thoughts that pop into consciousness
5540415 if instead you focus on the present moment on what needs to be done and what is happening right now then much of the feeling of stress goes away
5540416 these increases are proportional to the time a person has been meditating during their lives
5540417 this suggests that the thickness differences are acquired through extensive practice and not simply due to differences between meditators and nonmeditators
5540418 but further research needs to be done using a larger number of people and testing them multiple times we also need to examine their brains both before and after learning to meditate our group is currently planning to do this eventually such research should reveal more about the function of the thickening that is how it affects emotions and knowing in terms of both awareness and judgment

5540421 elizabeth one day you too will understand just the right man will catch your eye and you will not be able to turn away
5540422 and id just be tickled pink if for example mrs throckmorton in the math department could whip out her glock 19 drop an intruder at 30 feet and then get back to explaining exponents and whatnot without missing a beat
5540423 unless pursuant to the written regulations or written authorization of the institution
5540424 and if ive got to get off a few rounds at an intruder i might accidentally shoot that rascal rowdy burkitt then some might think that id shot rowdy on purpose heaven forbid

5540441 our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure your playing a small role doesnt serve the world
5540442 the problem isnt that our aims are too high and we miss them rather our aims are too low and we reach them
5540443 it takes no more effort to dream big than it does to dream small
5540444 it has been my experience that folks who have no vices have few virtues

5540457 they only use each other to raise money from their stupid believers
5540458 i heard an npr report on this fundraiser and the connection between the two the report said that mccain investigated reed and his connections with abramoff and the fleecing of the indian tribes but at least it mentioned that mccain never called reed to testify
5540459 sent the messages on his own and was not coordinating with the campaign
5540460 he sent the e mail at the request of the campaign and was given boilerplate language to use
5540461 we were the underdog in every game we played through the playoffs last year no one thought we were going to win those games and we went out and won them
5540462 were still the underdog that doesnt upset us we dont mind going under the radar a little bit were still the super bowl champions
5540463 i think we do have a chip on our shoulder you read the papers we had no chance in the nfc
5540464 if you need motivation at this level you dont need to be here
5540465 if you cant hype yourself up when you walk out into a stadium and see 85 000 screaming fans theres something wrong with you
5540466 its good to write about and players love to talk about us against the world and we played that role well it worked for us if it helps players get a little chip on their shoulder im ok with it it the super bowl is in the books for me whether it was a fluke or what its in the books
5540467 at the end of 06 it was the same basic formula fire the coach get rid of the quarterback fire all the players we go 0 2 and its fire the coach fire the quarterback get rid of the players you just hang in there
5540468 its sad to see people go but its part of the business
5540469 ive been around for a while ive seen a lot of people come and go and luckily ive been the one to stay around hopefully i stay around a little bit longer
5540470 its a challenge every year not only to have success but to also meet new people and have new experiences with people
5540471 he could probably play full time inside with his body type hes a 3 4 left end he has unusual quickness for his size inside
5540472 obviously our secondary is very young weve got a lot of depth there and thats really good for us
5540473 but you never want to have too much youth because they dont have the same experience as a
5540474 i told him i would give some of my money to have him come back and i was dead serious
5540475 he was a breath of fresh air as far as how he went about his business as a defensive coordinator
5540476 hes just becoming more and more aware of what it means to be a quarterback in this league and to have control in all of these situations and know exactly what he wants to do and his teammates have such great belief in him
5540477 i dont feel differently maybe someone from the outside could say something different but i dont feel ive changed
5540478 im still a humble person i still look forward to practice i still get upset when we have bad plays i still prepare the same way from a football standpoint im doing the same things and preparing to get better
5540479 the ineffable joy that can be had in pursuing the absurd
5540480 my head was so full of words that i often had trouble forming simple sentences out loud
5540481 and my speech became a curious jumble of obscure words and improper syntax
5540482 some days i feel as if i do not actually speak the english language
5540483 like trying to remember all the trees one sees through the window of a train
5540484 i find myself wondering why ive never seen this odd term that describes such a common article of clothing
5540485 sometimes i get angry at the dictionary and let loose with a muffled yell
5540486 the point at which i became bored has long since passed
5540487 human smoke the beginnings of world war ii the end of civilization
5540488 im so sorry to bother you i know you have so much to do

5540490 yes i have about 15 apps loaded and now only 8 10 work with the new 2 0 2 software

5540492 didnt improve my 3g signal or signal in general for that matter and i still am getting the keyboard lag
5540493 how many times i signed that name in my life
5540494 that music is still echoing which nobody could have predicted thats what im proudest of the impact that we had n w a changed the rules
5540495 the thing that people dont talk about really is that it opened artists up to being themselves in a lot of ways they didnt have to try to figure out what to do or be to become stars they could just be themselves after n w a you didnt have to put on the polish to be a star
5540496 fred durst of limp bizkit fame which has cube as a somewhat unsavory guy who through coaching his niece in pop warner football learns some life lessons
5540497 proves that even though hes middle aged hes still hungry
5540498 we thought our music was going to land on the shelves with the dirty comedy albums
5540499 when i was 16 if someone asked me what kind of career and life i wanted to have i would have shortchanged myself if i wrote it out then it wouldnt have come close to the reality there was no template then no way to picture where hip hop was going to go
5540500 i think about going to audio achievements at the end of van ness right there in torrance thats where we recorded it was a textbook 80s studio the wood paneling on the walls it was cold in there too we were used to working out of the garage man where it was sweaty and muggy we were in jackets and our teeth are chattering
5540501 you can hear the frustration with the situation we tried to have fun with it but the music was reflecting what was going on in the neighborhood living in the 1980s just trying to get by day by day in places where crack was huge and the police were crazy
5540502 then the rodney king thing happened a few years later and then all over the world people looked and said hey those guys from compton were right
5540503 do you like everything you made when you were 17
5540504 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
5540505 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
5540506 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
5540507 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
5540508 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
5540509 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government

5540511 and let others enjoy the privilege to do so too
5540512 we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract
5540513 we cannot dedicate we can not consecrate we can not hallow this ground
5540514 they pick the most dangerous enemy they can find and its themselves
5540515 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
5540516 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
5540517 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
5540518 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
5540519 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
5540520 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
5540521 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american

5540548 him that cometh to me mark the promises are nearly always to the coming ones i will in no wise cast out
5540549 but suppose a man should come who was not chosen would he be saved
5540550 suppose any one should go to christ who had not been called of the spirit
5540551 every man that cometh shall be saved for no man cometh to me except the father draw him

5540563 i came to christ without the power of the spirit
5540564 my dear sir i quite believe it and i believe you went away again without the power of the spirit and that you know nothing about the matter and are in the gall of bitterness and the bond of iniquity

5540586 the first amendments right to the free exercise of religion
5540587 does not exempt defendant physicians here from conforming their conduct to the unruh acts anti discrimination requirements even if compliance poses an incidental conflict with defendants religious beliefs
5540588 the trial courts ruling left defendant physicians free to later offer evidence at trial that their religious objections were to participating in the medical insemination of an unmarried woman and were not based on plaintiffs sexual orientation
5540589 the trial courts ruling simply narrowed the issues in this case by disposing of defendants contention that their constitutional rights to free speech and the free exercise of religion exempt them from complying with the unruh civil rights acts prohibition against sexual orientation discrimination

5540615 the gourmet traveller awards once again make nonsense of their claim to be a national poll
5540616 over the last five years rotarian numbers have dropped from fifteen hundred to eleven hundred in district 9670
5540617 worldwide there are 1 2 million rotarians but that number has remained stagnant for the last ten years
5540618 the need for service is increasing and population is increasing but the number of rotarians is not increasing in line with it
5540619 this is a problem thats not defined to dubbo most clubs across the country are having trouble getting members
5540620 we have 26 members in our club and membership has been static over the last three years
5540621 membership peaked a few years ago but its remained the same ever since and we cant seem to increase our numbers
5540622 there is a big belief that once you get involved in rotary you dont have time to do anything else but thats not true
5540623 we recognised the problem and have step in place to address the shortfall in 2002 we had 28 members and today we have 44
5540624 generation y seems to be the me generation and people dont think they have the time to be a rotarian but its such a worthwhile organisation if being a rotarian meant missing out on two hours of tv a night that its a worthwhile sacrifice
5540625 we could take all the rain we could get now an inch or two now would be just beautiful and we could even handle an extra three inches
5540626 between sixty and seventy per cent of our crops came up on rains in june so they are doig it tough because once they were out of the ground they started to get frost and that really slowed them up
5540627 however crops that started to emerge in april are thriving because of secondary roots in moisture
5540628 ive never heard of any glassing attacks like that here thats not saying they dont happen though things like that are just not heard of

5540665 made it seem like the united states was more committed to keeping musharraf in power than pursuing a functioning democracy
5540666 president musharraf has made the right decision to step down as president of pakistan
5540667 a year ago i advocated that the us move from a musharraf policy to a pakistan policy
5540668 the resignation of president pervez musharraf is a step toward moving pakistan onto a more stable political footing pakistan is a critical theater in countering the threat of al qaeda and violent islamic extremism and i look forward to the government increasing its future cooperation
5540669 there are serious problems that must be addressed the situation in pakistans frontier regions requires immediate and continued attention and i hope that the elections for president musharrafs successor will serve to reconcile the pakistani people behind a leader who can solidify their government internally it is critical that the united states continue to work in partnership with the pakistani people and their democratically elected government to tackle the many challenges we both face
5540670 a much more pro musharraf line than most other prominent u s politicians
5540671 a step toward moving pakistan onto a more stable political footing

5540673 the united states pakistan relationship is going to become stronger as a result of
5540674 every time he took away peoples civil liberties every time somebody went to prison every time somebody went missing and joined the ranks of the disappeared every action of musharraf angered people against the united states that factor is now gone
5540675 at different levels of being discredited the united states was holding onto a very narrow base which was not good for pakistan and not good for the united states
5540676 its a big country its a complex place there are 165 million people we cant just do it all through authoritarian rulers or through the military we have to push the democratic opening thats taking place there

5540719 we went to the beach to the amusement park i realized later how much of a relief it was for my parents dont get me wrong we all love eddie and we missed him but for that one week we could do all the things that were much harder to do with eddie
5540720 when he heard our voices he started to cry and im sure it was because he didnt want to leave for that week he got undivided attention everything was for him how often does anyone get that
5540721 sungguhpun anwar sering kali menyatakan bahawa pakatan itu sudah mempunyai bilangan anggota dewan rakyat secukupnya bagi membentuk kerajaan baru itu apabila beberapa anggota daripada barisan nasional melompat parti banyak pihak meragui kenyataan ini

5540723 pas sendiri telah menyatakan bahawa ia akan menjadi parti yang mewakili kepentingan orang melayu dan orang islam dalam kerajaan baru itu ini perlu bagi mewujudkan keyakinan orang melayu
5540724 namun golongan bukan islam rata rata masih meragui sikap parti itu yang tidak mahu berkompromi dalam pendiriannya berhubung prinsip perjuangannya itu

5540744 celtic christians had a name for the holy spirit an geadh glas or the wild goose the name hints at mystery much like a wild goose the spirit of god cannot be tracked or tamed an element of danger an air of unpredictability surround him and while the name may sound a little sacrilegious i cannot think of a better description of what its like to follow the spirit through life i think the celtic christians were on to something most of us will have no idea where we are going most of the time and i know that is unsettling but circumstantial uncertainty also goes by another name adventure

5540776 we continue to grow our market share as recently opened stores mature we open new stores expand our offering and reduce our prices on the back of increased economies of scale and a continued focus on costs
5540777 they have convinced the market they are a very cheap offer across the entire range especially at the bottom end and are one of the few retailers of music hardware that is still booming you could fire a cannon through sanity shops and not hit anyone at the moment but jb hi fi is doing well
5540778 in the last year or so they opened a new tidy store and it didnt work so they went back to hand written tickets and basic look associated with their stores the grunginess is quite studied but very successful and the market is convinced jb is the place to go for a bargain
5540779 they have kept their model up to date entering new sectors like computers and games and the culture there is one of constant reinvention and challenging what they do
5540780 if that happens it will be very interesting woolworths is a highly controlled organisation managers are told exactly what to do and jbs is not like that at all so it would be very difficult

5540830 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5540831 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5540832 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5540833 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5540834 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5540835 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5540836 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5540837 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5540838 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5540839 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5540840 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5540841 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5540842 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice

5540874 for some time relative calm was maintained in south ossetia
5540875 the war games included a us navy supercarrier battle group an us navy expeditionary carrier battle group a royal navy carrier battle group a french nuclear hunter killer submarine plus a large number of us navy cruisers destroyers and frigates playing the
5540876 a strategic diversion has been created for russia the south ossetia capital has been shelled and a large georgian tank force has been heading towards the border american marines a thousand of them have recently been in georgia training the georgian military forces russia has stated that it will not sit by and allow the georgians to attack south ossetia this could get bad and remember it is just a strategic diversion but one that could have horrific effects
5540877 cases of possible threats by russia directed at georgia with the intention of taking control over the baku ceyhan pipeline
5540878 russia actively tends to isolate the central asian region from direct access to world economy especially to energy supplies if georgia government is destabilized western access to baku caspian sea and further will be limited
5540879 ever since the continents started interacting politically some five hundred years ago eurasia has been the center of world power the key to controlling eurasia says brzezinski is controlling the central asian republics
5540880 brzezinski russias invasion of georgia is reminiscent of stalins attack on finland
5540881 the russians deliberately provoked the fighting in south ossetia and timed it for the olympics this is a long standing russian effort to get rid of president saakashvili
5540882 and i want to stress im not a warmonger and i dont want a new cold war any more than dimitri does the russians wish to re establish a historic area of hegemony that includes ukraine and it is no accident that the other former soviet republics are watching this and extraordinarily upset as putin progresses with an attempt to re create a kind of a hegemonic space
5540883 the unipolar world refers to a world in which there is one master one sovereign one center of authority one center of force one center of decision making at the end of the day this is pernicious not only for all those within this system but also for the sovereign itself because it destroys itself from within what is even more important is that the model itself is flawed because at its basis there is and can be no moral foundations for modern civilization
5540884 unilateral and frequently illegitimate actions have not resolved any problems moreover they have caused new human tragedies and created new centers of tension judge for yourselves wars as well as local and regional conflicts have not diminished more are dying than before significantly more significantly more today we are witnessing an almost uncontained hyper use of force military force in international relations force that is plunging the world into an abyss of permanent conflicts we are seeing a greater and greater disdain for the basic principles of international law and independent legal norms are as a matter of fact coming increasingly closer to one states legal system one state and of course first and foremost the united states has overstepped its national borders in every way this is visible in the economic political cultural and educational policies it imposes on other nations well who likes this who is happy about this in international relations we increasingly see the desire to resolve a given question according to so called issues of political expediency based on the current political climate and of course this is extremely dangerous it results in the fact that no one feels safe i want to emphasize this no one feels safe because no one can feel that international law is like a stone wall that will protect them of course such a policy stimulates an arms race i am convinced that we have reached that decisive moment when we must seriously think about the architecture of global security
5540885 s han sido muchas las invitaciones y est mal hecho en vez de que me pongan a dudar es al contrario lo nico que hacen es que confirmarme que es un no rotundo y no s lo son las fechas sino tambi n es porque no me han sabido escuchar no s por qu est n dando informaci n err nea ya se dijo que es un no rotundo y no s lo lo he dicho yo ya se habl con la gente de ocesa y ellos se han encargado de platicar con azteca para decirles que es imposible

5540899 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5540900 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5540901 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5540902 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5540903 with widespread support throughout the industry opensocial has become a de facto standard for developers of social applications opensocial makes it easier than ever for developers to build and distribute their applications across multiple destination sites like friendster developers can spend less of their time on integrating and more of their time on building interesting useful fun and or compelling features
5540904 everybody wins users gain access to new features developers can introduce their innovations to the massive user bases of social networks and social networks gain third party features to continue to drive up user engagement on social networks
5540905 we are pleased that friendster has deployed opensocial apis for the benefit of users and developers alike
5540906 friendsters launch is another major milestone in the adoption and deployment of opensocial throughout the social web and around the world were particularly excited that opensocial is helping friendster bring new social applications to users in asia and we look forward to seeing users embrace these apps

5540910 if you come in and have a collision at home you never hit someone in the chest

5540920 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5540921 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5540922 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5540923 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5540924 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5540925 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5540926 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5540927 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5540928 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5540929 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5540930 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5540931 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5540932 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5540933 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5540934 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5540935 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5540936 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5540937 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5540938 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5540939 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5540940 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5540941 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5540942 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5540943 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5540944 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5540945 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5540946 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5540947 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5540948 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5540949 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5540950 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5540951 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5540952 hasta el momento no ha habido indicios de contacto o avistamiento de los pescadores que estar an perdidos ni tampoco indicios de naufragio que nos indiquen que haya habido una desgracia mayor

5540975 are we all politicians in darjeeling hills every single individual is a politician
5540976 if this is the situation that a final year student of nbmch who knows the doctors on call and the procedures has to face what would be the plight of the common man seeking emergency treatment
5540977 we reached the emergency ward around 6 30 other than bandaging the wounds no treatment was given till 9 30 when the fingers were finally stitched
5540978 the on duty orthopaedic surgeon and physician were absent for a long time and the x ray of his fingers was ultimately taken at midnight before that he had to be taken to the ot to stop the bleeding
5540979 but that is a far cry he was bleeding for three hours and his x ray was done almost six hours later the emergency pathological tests were done only this morning
5540980 i was watching a basketball game that started at 7 a m but then i fell asleep
5540981 when they ask us if well play a certain game at midnight well yes that is fine but after 2am the bar closes and everyone goes home no matter what game is showing
5540982 i am work and cant watch so i just get it online
5540983 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5540984 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5540985 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5540986 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5540987 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5540988 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5540989 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5540990 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5540991 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5540992 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5540993 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
5540994 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5540995 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5540996 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5540997 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5540998 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5540999 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5541000 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5541001 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5541002 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5541003 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

5541011 are we all politicians in darjeeling hills every single individual is a politician
5541012 while taxis will continue to be exempt from sporting gl number plates those which are being used by government officials must put on the number plates from monday
5541013 i am not aware of the directive let us watch and see
5541014 our non cooperation is against the government but if its officials are moving around in taxis which have been exempted it does not serve our purpose
5541015 many people want to switch over to new plates but are confused about whether it is for them or not this is the only reason why we made it mandatory
5541016 our non cooperation movement is towards the state government and therefore it becomes mandatory for everybody especially the state government vehicles to bear gl number plates
5541017 people are interested but confused regarding the decision to use gl plates on their vehicles so with due permission from the president we are making its use compulsory for all vehicles excluding passenger taxis from today
5541018 even if passenger taxis are exempted the ones being used by government officials should bear gl plates
5541019 dghc vehicles and the private ones are writing the numbers on paper and sticking those on the vehicle windows henceforth all vehicles would have to use proper plates
5541020 are we all politicians in darjeeling hills every single individual is a politician
5541021 our company has had the privilege of supplying the packets of indian tea
5541022 it was gratifying to see that indian brands of tea were appreciated by the dignitaries we hope that the souvenirs will help the international promotion of indian tea
5541023 we had our stall there where the limited edition tea packets supplied to the olympics were displayed
5541024 there were several enquiries and representatives of companies like yuan tai tea industry met us
5541025 after the olympics are over we will seek the permission of the organising committee to merchandise the limited edition tea
5541026 we would make minor changes in the labels and packets and also plan to bring down the rate

5541031 there are no asterisks in this life only scoreboards and ours is currently reading f cked
5541032 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5541033 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5541034 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5541035 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5541036 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5541037 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

5541040 well take over the cement plants at midnight because the deadline has come and theyll become state property
5541041 it was not possible to arrive at an agreement with them cemex and the next step that we must take is to proceed with expropriation
5541042 asking a price way above the real price they were asking for more than 1 2 billion dollars
5541043 so tomorrow well go ahead with nationalizing and regaining the cement industries
5541044 the world has seen that even today there are political morons who are ready to kill innocent and defenseless people in order to satisfy their self serving interests while compensating for their own inability to resolve complicated issues by using the most terrible solution by exterminating an entire people

5541051 i really want this to be about making the delegate experience better

5541054 these are some of the fun and games scenarios weve been playing around with
5541055 weve now got an application that we can plug any hardware rfid device into
5541056 in fact the fixed and mobile readers all interface into the same system technology and code base this means that if im from an rfid world i can build out a mobile rfid component without too much upskill or needing to reprogram in a separate language
5541057 each door is manned by its own local system which can be run in isolation these also drive the displays in each room
5541058 we did our initial processing with a centralised model but our concern was if the network went down we still wanted to be able to read people going in or out of the doors so we settled on 34 localised rfid server systems
5541059 we want to dispel some of the myths about rfid
5541060 we want to inspire people to get to rooms quickly and get seats when they see them filling up in real time
5541061 we also want to really inspire them to see what can be done with our application stack out of the box and get them thinking about rfid beyond traditional supply chain applications

5541066 the resignation of president pervez musharraf is a step toward moving pakistan onto a more stable political footing pakistan is a critical theater in countering the threat of al qaeda and violent islamic extremism and i look forward to the government increasing its future cooperation
5541067 there are serious problems that must be addressed the situation in pakistans frontier regions requires immediate and continued attention and i hope that the elections for president musharrafs successor will serve to reconcile the pakistani people behind a leader who can solidify their government internally it is critical that the united states continue to work in partnership with the pakistani people and their democratically elected government to tackle the many challenges we both face
5541068 of course this is not only a stunning and utter victory for the taliban and al qaeda but also quite a feather in the cap of their allies in our media and the democrats the rational among us will regret this day for a very long time
5541069 this is the preposterous situation in a nutshell not only did benazir bhuto and her husband rob pakistan blind she also was instrumental in the rise of the taliban and still they killed her yet her idiot son takes their side and even blames their enemies for his mothers death
5541070 of interest concern to the readers of this blog is the future of pakistans efforts against militancy a fair amount of the population views the conflict against the afghan and pakistani taliban and their fellow travelers in fata and nwfp as a musharraf american driven effort not a pakistani one what will happen in the post musharraf era will pakistans civilian government continue to pursue the extremists even if they decide to do so can either the government or the army provide the leadership necessary to do so against militants are continuing in the nwfp with nearly 500 killed recently yet the taliban continues to collect taxes throughout the tribal agencies

5541081 morgans 25th century earth is convincing while the questions he poses about how much self is tied to body chemistry and how the rich believe themselves above the law are especially timely
5541082 were not going to cut aid to education that would bring it back to the property tax payer were not going to cut the quality of healthcare that new yorkers want and i dont think its appropriate to lay off state workers but i think were at 3 to 400 million

5541086 harper needs all the help he can get in quebec a place where mulroney continues to command a network of political leaders and operatives and where he remains much beloved
5541087 should mulroney decide to intervene in the next election campaign against harper the prime ministers efforts to win a majority may be thwarted
5541088 in the end mr harper will be the worse for it this was one of the rare occasions where mr harper panicked to his detriment
5541089 wise enough to be tough on his opponents when it is to his advantage but he must display a more amiable side to his party the press and the nation being optimistic and visionary rather than gruff and a loner is the better path to becoming a majority prime minister

5541113 its hard to hit with both hands wrapped around your neck and thats what it feels like when you walk up there
5541114 the weight of the world the weight of the team depends on you to drive in a big run get something kick started once you dont do it a time or two the pressure mounts every time you have that opportunity hopefully we can get a game here soon that everybody in the lineup gets a hit drives in a run those are things that breed confidence

5541126 cleans the air filters harmful particles and cools the earth and can be up to 70 to 80 degrees cooler than the artificial turf
5541127 the testing should be done before they put it down
5541128 from what we understand from what the health department has told us from what the experts have told us there is no reason to be concerned about this the greater risk really is kids not getting exercise in the fight against childhood obesity
5541129 the main event with the synthetic turf fields is allowing children adults athletes to get the maximum amount of use of the field
5541130 i would prefer real over fake anything the more natural the better it is when you get down to it thats all we are nature
5541131 if we find that there is a public health risk well take the necessary steps after that
5541132 this summer con ed increased its rates for residential customers by 22 and for its commercial customers by 25 for its supply of electric power this comes on the heels of a 6 increase for the delivery of electric power in april
5541133 the amount of service we are getting has not increased with how the prices have increased
5541134 when i started my business 20 years ago the electric bill used to be 300 or 400 a month and then 10 years back it was 500 and five years back it was 600 then in the last three years it has tripled
5541135 last year i had a 15 000 b t u air conditioner humming along in my living room
5541136 my bill went up 12 i feel i am playing a shell game or three card monte in
5541137 i dont want to make you any more uncomfortable but where did she touch you
5541138 worse than you could imagine had to knock yocchan out shes on the floor right now

5541141 im gonna have to ask you some questions about what happened yesterday
5541142 i have this black eye and a few broken ribs
5541143 she was afraid to go in the living room at the hotel this morning
5541144 but im not sure when shell warm up to you again
5541145 i dont want to make you any more uncomfortable but where did she touch you
5541146 one of great military leaders in american history who took us from defeat to victory in iraq
5541147 who can teach us all a lot about the meanings of courage and commitment to causes greater than ourself
5541148 i cannot stop one human being even a presidential candidate from admiring the courage and sacrifice of peaceful protesters on the edmund pettus bridge or making comments about it
5541149 sen mccain and i are colleagues in the us congress not confidantes he does not consult me and i do not consult him
5541150 europe will be divided again the lines are different pushed farther east but the division is the same and dangerous
5541151 you cannot conduct foreign policy based on fear of russia weve been through this before ukraine knows it the baltic republics know it
5541152 i dont think russia is an immediate threat to us in the military sense but they are a nasty neighbor
5541153 an alliance with the united states is a long term investment
5541154 poland by deploying the interceptors is exposing itself to a strike 100
5541155 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
5541156 i am not afraid of an invasion and i hate the russians
5541157 that empire is very aggressive but we count on the word of the united states we will be safe because the u s supports us
5541158 only the u s can protect us not europe and so there is no danger for poland
5541159 one battery of patriots will provide no security for warsaw there are lots of threats and not enough privileges
5541160 a great deal still depends on a decisions amp good judgment of a next president a hard won gains of our troops hang in a balance a lasting advantage of a peaceful amp democratic ally in a heart of a middle east could still be squ amp ered by hasty withdrawal amp arbitrary timelines amp this is one of many problems in a shifting positions of my opponent senator obama
5541161 we won a massive victory in a few weeks amp we did so with very limited loss of american amp allied lives we were able to end aggression with minimum overall loss of life amp we were even able to greatly reduce a civilian casualties of afghani amp iraqi citizens
5541162 well an why was are a banner that said mission accomplished on a aircraft carrier look a i have said a long time that reconstruction of iraq would be a long long difficult process but a conflict a major conflict is over a regime change has been accomplished amp its very drunk newspropriate
5541163 senator obama commits a greater error of insisting that even in hindsight he would oppose a surge even in retrospect he would choose a path of retreat amp failure for america over a path of success amp victory
5541164 i suppose from my opponents vantage point veterans concerns are just one more issue to be spun or worked to advantage this would explain why he has also taken liberties with my position on a gi bill as a political proposition it would have much easier for me to have just signed on to what i considered flawed legislation but a people of arizona amp of all america expect more from air representatives than that amp instead i sought a better bill im proud to say that a result is a law that better serves our military better serves military families amp better serves a interests of our country
5541165 behind all of ase claims amp positions by senator obama lies a ambition to be president
5541166 whats less drunk newsparent is a judgment to be comm amp er in chief amp in matters of national security good judgment will be at a premium in a term of a next president as we were all reminded ten days ago by events in a nation of georgia
5541167 mccain may not have been in a cone of silence
5541168 may have had some ability to overhear what a questions were to obama
5541169 a fact is that during senator obamas segment at saddleback last night senator mccain was in a motorcade to a event amp an held in a green room with no broadcast feed
5541170 one may use a radio a cellphone a blackberry bluetooth wireless a slingbox amp perhdrunk newss a satellite tv feed whear mccain actually used any of those devices we have no idea but he absolutely had a ability to use am which is all that mitchell had reported
5541171 this is irresponsible journalism amp sadly indicative of a level of objectivity we have witnessed at nbc news this election cycle
5541172 we are concerned that your news division is following msnbcs lead in ab amp oning non partisan coverage of a presidential race we would like to request a meeting with you as soon as possible to discuss our deep concerns about a news st amp ards amp level of objectivity at nbc
5541173 we feel it is unfair for them to continue to do this without compensation so we are trying to contract with them for their services
5541174 had set up meetings with red hat in part to position vmware as friendly to open source and possibly as a prelude to a buyout discussion
5541175 traditionally people have tied their software to their hardware virtualization changes all that
5541176 yet when i preach the gospel i cannot boast for i am compelled to preach woe to me if i do not preach the gospel
5541177 they think that there are some elements in the isi at some level that when the government of pakistan is informed of targets then leak it to them militants at some level
5541178 security of the population especially in baghdad and in partnership with the iraqi security forces will be the focus of the military effort
5541179 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5541180 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5541181 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5541182 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
5541183 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
5541184 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
5541185 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
5541186 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
5541187 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
5541188 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
5541189 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
5541190 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
5541191 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
5541192 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
5541193 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5541194 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5541195 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5541196 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5541197 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5541198 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5541199 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5541200 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5541201 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5541202 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5541203 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5541204 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5541205 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5541206 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5541207 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5541208 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5541209 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5541210 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5541211 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5541212 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5541213 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5541214 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5541215 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5541216 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5541217 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5541218 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5541219 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5541220 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5541221 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5541222 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5541223 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5541224 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5541225 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5541226 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5541227 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5541228 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5541229 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5541230 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5541231 this is a planning took where all things are going
5541232 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5541233 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5541234 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5541235 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5541236 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5541237 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5541238 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5541239 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5541240 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5541241 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5541242 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5541243 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5541244 arent all women lesbians these days bisexual swingers isnt that all the rage
5541245 how do they keep the baby from being covered in poop
5541246 oh maybe he doesnt like to be a boy or
5541247 imagine if we were living in yakima wed go to yakima high school our mascot would be the what the yaks who would want to cheer for a potato
5541248 its no reassurance to me that i was there at her final moments theres not much reassurance anywhere im devastated

5541268 hari ini umno sekali lagi jadi malu malu kucing apabila presiden mengulangi kenyataanya menolak terus usaha umno untuk menarik pas menyertai mereka
5541269 lepas ini jangan ada lagi tohmahan yang mengatakan pas hendak menyertai barisan nasional bn dan meninggalkan pakatan rakyat
5541270 kita berdoa malah menteri besar kelantan dalam kuliahnya berdoa supaya anwar menang dalam pilihan raya kecil sekali gus menyenangkan laluan ke putrajaya
5541271 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5541272 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5541273 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5541274 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5541275 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5541276 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5541277 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5541278 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5541279 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5541280 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5541281 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5541282 we need to have opportunities for folks to get their lives back
5541283 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5541284 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5541285 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5541286 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

5541294 como cualquier otro estudio todav a estamos sintiendo las repercusiones de la huelga de guionistas que afect la preparaci n de guiones para otros filmes
5541295 sabemos que los fans esperan con impaciencia ver los cap tulos finales en la pantalla de hecho la buena noticia para ellos es que el hueco es ahora m s corto entre el pr ncipe mestizo y la primera parte de las reliquias de la muerte
5541296 el potencial para alcanzar a la m s amplia audiencia posible estoy sumamente orgulloso de esta ltima pel cula y del trabajo de david yates y nuestro incomparable equipo creo que hemos desarrollado y empujado la serie m s lejos todav a esperamos con impaciencia compartir esto con las fans de harry potter alrededor del mundo incluso si tenemos que esperar un poco m s

5541299 cuando warner bros decidi mover harry potter y el pr ncipe mestizo para el verano del 2009 vimos una oportunidad nica de colocar nuestra pel cula que ha estado ganando expectativa e mpetu durante los meses pasados
5541300 no estamos tratando de llenar los zapatos de potter en el 2008 s lo tratamos de darle a los admiradores de stephenie meyer la pel cula tan pronto como sea posible
5541301 por favor sepan que este cambio de horario no tiene absolutamente nada que ver con twilight yo o summit films as que suficiente con los deseos de muerte en imdb si esto es una decisi n de warner bros y no fue motivado por nada de twilight ahora las buenas noticias aunque estemos tristes de tener que esperar por harry potter este punto abierto en el cine crea una oportunidad muy genial la buena gente de summit estuvieron emocionadas al dejarme saber que ahora los admiradores de twilight van a tener su pel cula tres semanas antes de la estipulada
5541302 estamos haciendo un juego grandioso que los fans de harry potter disfrutar n estamos evaluando el impacto del cambio de fecha de la pel cula
5541303 ohmygod i was sooooo drunk and my friend fanny fell in a fountain
5541304 and then we all done tequila slammers and it was sooo much fun
5541305 usually you see bait fish on the water you dont see no bait fish nothing nothings there
5541306 i dont have no kind of testing material to test the water but i know somethings wrong
5541307 were not finding enough oxygen to support life aquatic life
5541308 theres no oxygen in the water for shrimp crabs fish to live
5541309 can sense that and they start to move out of the area otherwise they would die the animals that still remain in the sediments have to keep breathing there is not enough oxygen and eventually they will die off
5541310 thats the primary source of the nutrients that go to the gulf of mexico
5541311 and so the size of the low oxygen zone has increased in proportion to these nutrients reaching the gulf
5541312 so these things will fall to the bottom and as they decompose they consume oxygen
5541313 the deeper we go down in the water it gets kind of scary because theres nothing there theres no fish theres no organisms alive so its just us
5541314 its dark and its turbid because all that algae that is dying thats sinking through the water column
5541315 you just gotta keep going miles and miles and miles and hopefully youll run into something
5541316 the fuel costs are so high its just not feasible to get out there unless you can catch a boatload really make any money out of it
5541317 all my boats have to go somewhere else to make a living its a shame

5541336 if you have an insatiable lust for items with higher stats than the ones youre currently using or if you get giddy at the mere thought of diablo style rare item naming conventions youll probably be able to look past the games issues and have a good time but even at its best its hard to ignore too humans monotonous combat and dated approach to cooperative play
5541337 too human is a game of false starts and unrealized potential that infiltrate almost every aspect of the game from story to combat to balance its elements feel stitched together making for a patchwork quilt of a game thats fraying at the seams

5541362 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
5541363 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5541364 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5541365 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5541366 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5541367 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5541368 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5541369 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5541370 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5541371 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5541372 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5541373 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5541374 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5541375 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5541376 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5541377 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5541378 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5541379 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5541380 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5541381 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta

5541383 how long do you think youll have to wait now
5541384 dont let it worry you just yet it could be a while
5541385 but i am worried i mean what if something happens to you
5541386 whats going to happen to me the worst that can happen is that they throw me straight back in here
5541387 well dont worry about me okay you need to be more worried about yourself once youre in here alone
5541388 youre listening to me right you know better than i do how dangerous some of the girls in here are theyll eat you alive given half the chance some of them literally
5541389 go wash your face and use the toilet if you need to
5541390 hey dont look at me like that fujimoto ive given you guys an extra three minutes out here with your buddies
5541391 oh dear have a bit of an accident did we
5541392 oh looks like some of niigakis traits are rubbing off on you eh then again i suppose thats not the only thing shes been rubbing on you is it
5541393 im not in the mood to put up with your shit
5541394 you mean that sometimes you are in the mood well you could have fooled me
5541395 so did she declare her undying love for you again
5541396 shame you two seem closer every time i see you i could put in a request to switch cells if you like
5541397 oh i know what youre thinking dont worry theyre no cells are they
5541398 ya saya tak ingin membicarakannya satu satunya yang ada di pikiran saya adalah saat ini dan berusaha berbuat yang terbaik bersama tim dan pelatih baru terlepas siapa yang nanti akan diturunkan yang penting kami bisa bekerja bersama
5541399 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
5541400 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
5541401 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
5541402 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
5541403 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
5541404 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
5541405 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5541406 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5541407 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5541408 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5541409 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5541410 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5541411 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5541412 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5541413 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5541414 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
5541415 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5541416 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5541417 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5541418 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5541419 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5541420 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5541421 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5541422 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5541423 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5541424 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
5541425 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
5541426 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
5541427 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
5541428 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
5541429 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
5541430 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
5541431 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
5541432 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
5541433 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
5541434 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
5541435 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
5541436 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
5541437 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
5541438 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
5541439 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5541440 the russian side is gravely violating the conditions provided for by the peace accord signed by the presidents of georgia france and the russian federation
5541441 we will do whatever is necessary and no one should have any illusion
5541442 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
5541443 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as
5541444 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto
5541445 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5541446 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
5541447 the most punitive criminal justice system in u s history
5541448 i dont want a guy to spend days or weeks in jail because he doesnt have 100
5541449 if you treat someone like an animal you release an animal
5541450 other than their freedom an inmate in my jail should be deprived of nothing else
5541451 we dont see bad guys in here we see guys whove made bad choices and face consequences for what they did
5541452 ill do whatever needs to be done for the hawaii kingdom
5541453 its time that kanaka maoli indigenous people of hawaii should be respected its time for a change our people need to be respected
5541454 were not sure if there is really a problem with theft or if occasionally you know the machine just runs out of paper no one wants to question the machine in motion
5541455 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5541456 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5541457 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5541458 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5541459 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5541460 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5541461 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5541462 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5541463 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5541464 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5541465 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5541466 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5541467 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5541468 god puts me through hell so i could make it to heaven

5541470 the opposite of a correct statement is a false statement but the opposite of a profound truth may well be another profound truth
5541471 democracy is a poor system of government at best the only thing that can honestly be said in its favor is that it is about eight times as good as any other method the human race has ever tried democracys worst faults is that its leaders are likely to reflect the faults and virtues of their constituents a depressingly low level but what else can you expect
5541472 there was so much to grok so little to grok from

5541483 our mission is to provide fourth fifth and sixth grade children with an opportunity to compete in a free organized and fun recreational sports league directed and coached by dartmouth student athletes
5541484 through sport the league will unite children of the upper valley with dartmouth athletes in an effort to expand their extracurricular activities in a way that builds skills confidence friendships and mentor relationships
5541485 while we certainly have bigger dreams for the future of athletes united to see the ideas weve been bouncing around for nine months come to life was incredibly exciting
5541486 we feel privileged to be able to work with the kids who have signed up and we only hope we can reach more children in the future i think were sitting on top of something that could hatch into a giant program for dartmouth athletes and the kids of the upper valley and we are going to do everything we can to make that happen
5541487 there needs to be an understanding that you dont have to have control anymore having that control is about the fear of losing control but if you drop that fear and let these tools proliferate and be used to the benefit of the business then you will get greater returns out of that
5541488 the cio that embraces web 2 0 will be more of an employer of choice
5541489 cios need to embrace the web 2 0 technologies not have a fear of them and let go of the emotional need to be in control they need to manage it in a consistent way however understand that change requires agility
5541490 the challenge is to keep everyone educated weve been through a bit of a revamp recently and weve just re launched our sales certification training and a new planning program

5541505 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
5541506 you cannot go to a 7 11 or dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent oh im not joking
5541507 slave state that fought beside the north thats only because we couldnt figure out how to get to the south there were a couple of states in the way
5541508 theres less than one percent of the population of iowa that is african american there is probably less than four of five percent that are minorities what is in washington so look it goes back to what you start off with what youre dealing with
5541509 when you have children coming from dysfunctional homes when you have children coming from homes where theres no books where the mother from the time theyre born doesnt talk to them as opposed to the mother in iowa whos sitting out there and talks to them the kid starts out with a 300 word larger vocabulary at age three half this education gap exists before the kid steps foot in the classroom
5541510 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5541511 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5541512 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5541513 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority
5541514 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies
5541515 if so many of the peppers we eat in the u s come in from mexico youd think we would want to pay more attention
5541516 two of the pubs near oxford which c s lewis frequented were the trout and the six bells some of lewiss american readers had written him to inquire about his views on drinking alcoholic beverages his response to them was in no uncertain terms i have always in my books been concerned simply to put forward mere christianity and am no guide on these most regrettable interdenominational questions i do however most strongly object to the tyrannic and unscriptural insolence of anything that calls itself a church and makes teetotalism a condition of membership apart from the more serious objection that our lord himself turned water into wine and made wine the medium of the only rite he imposed on all his followers it is so provincial what i believe you people call small town dont they realize that christianity arose in the mediterranean world where then as now wine was as much a part of the normal diet as bread

5541524 what ploy do atheists use against white christians and do they all go to the same school a school which tells them that when talking to a black christian they must always discuss slavery and race

5541527 monadelphous has moved into the new financial year with a strong forward workload and positive growth prospects for all divisions of the company
5541528 however capacity constraints will continue to provide the most significant challenge for the company and the broader industry
5541529 the risk of project deferrals and delays due to those constraints will continue to provide uncertainty as to the timing of construction revenues
5541530 a case could be made for an early reduction in the cash rate
5541531 clearly quite tight and effectively getting tighter as a result of ongoing pressure on lenders cost of funds in the market
5541532 given there had been a significant change in borrowing behaviour confidence was weaker asset prices had declined and slower overall growth was in prospect tighter financial conditions were not warranted
5541533 indeed less restrictive conditions could soon be called for otherwise the risk of a deeper and more persistent slowing in the economy would increase
5541534 all they are really saying here is that if they dont move towards less restrictive conditions the risk of a deeper or more persistent slowing of the economy would increase
5541535 they dont want that which is an argument to cut rates but by the same token the language is not strong enough to suggest they are heading towards a 50 basis point cut next month
5541536 i think it is consistent with 25 basis points next month
5541537 we expect the rba to deliver a 25 basis point cut in september followed by another similar move in october or november
5541538 partly dependent on how much the banks pass through to key lending rates
5541539 the minutes from the august board meeting confirmed the u turn by the rba as it adopted a clear easing bias amid a further tightening in financial conditions beyond that sanctioned by the move in official rates
5541540 the rba board was clearly caught between the opposing policy needs of fighting high inflation and dealing with a growth slowdown with the potential to go too far
5541541 our view remains that the rba may wait for third quarter inflation data before starting to cut the cash rate

5541672 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5541673 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5541674 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5541675 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5541682 anytime you have a death involving suspicious circumstances it could be labeled a murder investigation
5541683 we dont have an expectation of that but we certainly are investigating and preparing and trying to get to the bottom of the evidence in case that happens

5541694 i constantly replenish the supplies for kids that cant afford the things we have on our list
5541695 supplies are more expensive an eight pack of crayons costs more than a 24 pack

5541708 thats 0 28 which is 90 times less than the figure reported by the ap policymakers and the public should not be deceived by this story that misrepresents the gao report
5541709 on the same day he signed the decree king sihanouk made public a letter he had sent to amnesty international in which he said he would support the judgment of any that tries mr ieng sary or other khmer rouge leaders
5541710 you appear to insist that the theory of evolution denies the existence of a creator that is simply not true science is utterly agnostic on the god question and cannot adjudicate one way or the other it is appropriate for us as believers to discover how god created the universe around us and i personally have found it a truly wondrous experience it is surely not for us to in effect tell god what he can and cannot do
5541711 but if we think it through one question arises from all the salacious and murky details

5541713 he did sound interested but only briefly did he take his eyes off his smoke a little way off we stopped for a cup each of morning chai which i declined wondering if it was camel milk i so did not want to taste the

5541716 theyre pretty darned good weve come off two scrimmages against two pretty good teams in ursuline and massillon we certainly didnt have anyone slacking off i dont know that we took a step backward last week but i dont think we took a step forward we just have to remedy that
5541717 but were ready to move on after we showed the film and corrected a lot of things im anxious to see how they respond because this is game week were getting ready for the real deal now and our kids are excited about that we just want to go out and try to get better each practice every game
5541718 weve been throwing everything at them for the last three weeks or so
5541719 every possible formation every kind of look just to see how the kids would react
5541720 small motel trying to do too much and doing it badly
5541721 he hanlin liked the fact that it finished with a little bit of a gallery feel
5541722 most golfers dont get to experience that he could easily envision how people would be sitting up on that hill watching at outings
5541723 its really to show sports time ohio viewers various options where they can play golf within driving distance
5541724 if we can introduce golf to television viewers then we could help spread the popularity of the game of golf
5541725 itll be broadcast throughout northeast ohio and the show is gaining popularity theyll be showing the entire course we definitely hope that it will bring more business our way as people see what a great course we have
5541726 we know a good audience is waiting after indians games
5541727 when you compare viewer ratings of tee it up ohio to those like it in other states its three to five times higher than any other regional tv show in the country
5541728 i played in houston and i have a place there
5541729 it just so happens that my backyard and the backyard of shauns best friend connect
5541730 we got to know each other that way now its good to know were on the same team
5541731 weve got a lot of different personalities it just so happens none of our personalities clash
5541732 weve got some guys who go out there and love to work want to get better love to dominate want to go out there and prove a lot of people wrong
5541733 i mean we took a lot of stuff this offseason
5541734 as a group thats where our pride kicks in these new guys came in and fit right in with it
5541735 its never easy when you ask people for more money weve tried to be respectful of the economic times were in
5541736 i think our levy campaign has got to focus on that weve heard you and heres what weve done to earn your vote
5541737 no matter how much cutting you do its still going to be difficult for people to support the levy
5541738 thats very unusual and thats a very difficult thing to overcome
5541739 were talking about a community that is entrenched in its opposition to a new money levy
5541740 why have just one hoe when you can have a hoegaarden
5541741 i hereby declare quasar the official tangency news herald first class of the most exalted of geeks who want to know so let it be written so let it be done
5541742 this is tangency we flogged common sense to pay our pie bill a couple years back
5541743 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5541744 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5541745 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5541746 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5541747 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5541748 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5541749 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5541750 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5541751 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5541752 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5541753 i dont particularly want to add new features to the java language just new syntax for the compiler to let it do the ugly plumbing

5541757 maybe this time we can come through with something this area needs some access and right now i think if we can all sort of get on the same track and not have fights itll be good for the area
5541758 i guess you could put concessions and you could do all that but in the same token the bottom line is people want to get in and they want to get out
5541759 maybe a restaurant maybe more than one that would be a place where you could sit and you sit with your incoming or outgoing uh visitors uh i dont know what there is out there for corporate people

5541763 feedburner will start to look and feel more like a set of google services and we will be completing much tighter integration into other google services such as google adsense
5541764 i love how google fails to mention anywhere in the announcement that these ads will only appear on the dish satellite tv network the only tv service that will allow google to put its tracking software on its set top boxes

5541767 if anybody takes a hit from it its certainly nike simply because theyre all about performance whereas the others are about brand image
5541768 nikes all about you dont win silver you lose gold with that attitude its much tougher for them because he was certainly the cornerstone for their program

5541770 we will continue to count on liu xiang as an ambassador for our company and our brand because his achievements both on and off the field will continue to inspire fans and consumers throughout china
5541771 its about picking yourself up when youre down and coming back stronger
5541772 if the charge sticks then he will be thrown out of the sumo association
5541773 one of the problems as i see it is that he went up too quickly
5541774 japanese fans have made it clear that they have little patience with bad boy wrestlers
5541775 a 16 year low grade conflict over who should rule two small mountainous regions in the caucasus
5541776 hes been very truthful and to me thats the only way you can find common ground
5541777 we have probably failed to understand that the russians are really quite serious when they say we have interests and were going to defend them
5541778 russia does have interests and at some point theyre going to stand up and draw lines that are not simply to be ignored
5541779 we were training saakashvilis army and he was getting at least a corps of highly trained individuals which he could use for adventures
5541780 the feeling in the intelligence community was that this was a very high risk endeavor
5541781 but it was a little bit of the price we were willing to pay for the military cooperation in iraq
5541782 it was a combustible but it was a little bit of the price we were willing to pay for the military cooperation in iraq
5541783 i go back to the democracy thing im not saying i gave them a big pass here but looking back i should have pressed harder
5541784 the claim that this process is not directed against russia will not suffice
5541785 it definitely wasnt what i would call a look into your eyes and see your soul meeting
5541786 we must not allow russia to believe it has a free hand to engage in policies that undermine georgian sovereignty
5541787 theres no doubt that the georgians have carefully cultivated a broad base of support in washington
5541788 its possible that georgians may have confused the cheerleading from washington with something else
5541789 so are you going i understood you are going to give a tough fight for us in december

5541797 when in fact his fathers mummified remains were in his trailer surrounded by air fresheners
5541798 the gruesome facts adduced in this case will not be recounted here in full
5541799 suffice it to say the state produced overwhelming evidence at the guilt phase of the trial establishing that hankins killed his wife and her two children there was also evidence that hankins engaged in sexual activity with and around the dead bodies
5541800 that additional evidence on these issues would not have made a difference

5541827 we do have it forecast to reach hurricane strength but it could be right on that threshold of a tropical storm
5541828 we had some pretty extreme conditions down there yesterday and the day before so certainly we want to find them and make sure theyre ok blair said
5541829 things have calmed down there a bit were not receiving any reports of rainfall today so thats a good thing and that should help our evacuation efforts
5541830 people of the blue green waters according to grand canyon national park
5541831 there are a number of people who are registered down there blair said
5541832 theres a remote possibility they left the canyon without us knowing but theres a strong possibility they are still there
5541833 there were a few areas of flooding but the main one was cataract creek ketchum said in a telephone interview
5541834 how in the hell can that thing fit through maiden lane and down here
5541835 there are precious few at ease with moral ambiguities so we act as though they dont exist
5541836 anyone who tries anything like that will face a crushing response
5541837 we are witnessing the start of a withdrawal of troops today and into the night
5541838 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5541839 the city is a cold place now people are fearful
5541840 were not worried about it weve seen this movie before
5541841 there are bad storms and there are nice ones and this is a nice one
5541842 it cleans out all the trees it gives people a little work to do and it gets the tourists out of here for a few days
5541843 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5541844 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5541845 ive got a generator and ive got a concrete home that i built myself so i know it can withstand this
5541846 every hurricane that we have we have additional lessons learned and experience
5541847 i am conscious about the products i buy i make sure that they are able to be recycled
5541848 one of my biggest frustrations though is seeing trash or litter this was a chance for me to meet new people but to help out at the same time
5541849 i dont know anybody yet and i thought it would be a good way to meet some new people
5541850 its nothing intense i mean there arent any rapids or anything like that its just a nice relaxing ride
5541851 for me the best part is getting to know the students
5541852 in my position getting to know the students in a casual setting can be difficult most of the time ill only get to see them at awards dinners or ceremonies in the more structured environments
5541853 the needs of various temples and organizations within the buddhist community required more accredited lay representatives and qualified teachers to spread the dharma and to assist the sangha in other related activities
5541854 our buddhist ministers are not renunciates and cannot represent themselves as members of the monastic sangha
5541855 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5541856 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5541857 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5541858 if the mccain campaign wont return the money reed has raised for them then voters should rightly ask why it matters that reed didnt show up at tonights event the real question isnt why reed isnt showing up but why a so called reformer would invite him at all
5541859 i did give them documents a long time ago but these matters have been resolved for a long time now as far as im concerned
5541860 one would have to assume that its going to be this week
5541861 theres nobody down there in dire straits because they dont have any food or water right now
5541862 it was definitely frightening and there was a lot of whoa what are we going to do next and whats the morning going to bring
5541863 i woke up to people yelling weve got to get out of here
5541864 we booked it up a cliff in 10 seconds and we just saw this massive rush of water rage down the creek side
5541865 there was no way of hiking back there was no way of getting out
5541866 ive still got a rather lengthy amount of time before i decide anything
5541867 the pendulum is swinging very heavily in the direction of it just being over ive never sat around and not gotten ready to head to florida well not in 23 or so years anyway so to me that will likely be the last real test for me and whether or not i want to put the time and effort into getting after it one more time
5541868 next i started thinking about the original plan of pitching the 2nd half of next season thing is that urgency just is not there i miss some things i didnt think i would and dont miss many things
5541869 the lord has hidden himself from his people but i trust him and place my hope in him

5541873 your strong love for eachother will prove to the world that your are my diciples
5541874 no matter what i say what i believe what i do im bankrupt without love
5541875 you must love the lord your god with all your heart soul mind and strengh
5541876 these three thing continue forever faith hope and love and the greates of these is love
5541877 truly i tell you just as you did it to one of the least of these who members of my family you did it to me
5541878 ou can give without loving but you cannot love without giving
5541879 i heard you on the radio and it was great
5541880 if people know you are bipolar then every time you get angry they will believe it is because you are bipolar
5541881 do you believe that all the trouble you are having could be due to the sin in your life
5541882 what if it doesnt change what am i going to do are we going to end up on the street
5541883 im not quite sure but i just cant ignore the feelings that have become
5541884 the storms not a concern it just doesnt look like its going to do a lot of damage

5541896 things have to get much worse to pass the recession threshold
5541897 every recession since world war ii has included months that satisfied all three of these limits and there has never been a time in the expansions during which all three of these limits were satisfied
5541898 without knowing these shocks in advance it is unclear how a forecaster would have decided in 1999 which of the many promising leading indicators would perform well over the next few years and which would not

5541916 it is not a secret that the west is creating a buffer zone around russia involving in the process countries in central europe the caucasus the baltic states and ukraine
5541917 in response we may expand our military presence abroad including in cuba
5541918 cuba has convenient harbors which may host russian reconnaissance and combat ships and a network of forward landing airfields with the cuban leaderships consent and our own political will we may also consider resuming the work of an electronic listening post in lourdes
5541919 we were not even notified about the decision by the russian leadership

5541943 it will make it such a heightened experience for the audience and for us to cast a real life soldier a veteran and bring him into our created drama
5541944 its a very delicate subject to begin with theres so much about the individual person thats going to help us create the character and whatever they bring and whatever their challenge is will be fit into the story
5541945 the audience embraces it because they relate to the people involved who they care about
5541946 theyre great at drama but there are many nuances that can be left out without getting the reality from the troops themselves
5541947 she has heard proclaimed the theory that all men are created free and equal and this made the basis of an attack upon her social institutions and the sacred declaration of independence has been invoked to maintain the position of the equality of the races

5542195 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5542196 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5542197 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5542198 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5542199 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5542200 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5542201 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5542202 i dont think my mind set has changed any since april
5542203 more consistent pound the zone if you can show guys youre ahead in the zone theyre going to swing at pitches early in the count that arent necessarily good pitches to hit i was able to do that tonight
5542204 ill be honest i didnt know a lot about him before i got here
5542205 but its pretty obvious to me after being here that hes one of the better pitchers in this league
5542206 thats part of my job driving in runs and youve got to have guys on base to do that
5542207 its a testament to those guys im just trying to be a complement to the puzzle
5542208 probably the biggest struggle ive had all season with my stuff
5542209 my fastball command was not there i walked a lot of guys it might have been the toughest outing of the season for me as far as laboring i had to work hard to get through five and get a couple more
5542210 weve been coming back all year long and so were expecting one of those games
5542211 youre not going to win them all but obviously thats one of the better teams in the american league east and the american league for that matter theyve got a great bullpen and lester gave them a great start tonight
5542212 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5542213 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5542214 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5542215 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority
5542216 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies
5542217 if so many of the peppers we eat in the u s come in from mexico youd think we would want to pay more attention
5542218 the damages and costs ordered by the court are significant and should act as a deterrent
5542219 this shows that taking direct steps against infringers is an important and effective weapon in the battle against online piracy
5542220 it was always intended that there would be a lot more
5542221 this is a proper intellectual property ip court that has made this judgement
5542222 the previous ones were default judgements where defendants never turned up
5542223 i do not get any sense that theres been any fundamental shift in the desire to litigate
5542224 an open court process with a full report is certainly preferable to justice of the type being mooted by the government on p2p where activity takes place behind closed doors through industry action
5542225 interest fines penalties or other assessments that may be imposed
5542226 if the government is willing to agree to such a small amount the likelihood of wellcare being put out of business because of this investigation seems remote

5542228 the challenge now is to practice politics as the art of making what appears to be impossible possible
5542229 when making a decision of minor importance i have always found it advantageous to consider all the pros and cons in vital matters however such as the choice of a mate or profession the decision should come from the unconscious from somewhere within ourselves in the important decisions of personal life we should be governed i think by the deep inner needs of our nature

5542313 is the image clear and a true reflection of the company
5542314 given there has been a significant change in borrowing behaviour confidence was weaker asset prices had declined and slower overall growth was in prospect tighter financial conditions were not warranted
5542315 indeed less restrictive conditions could soon be called for otherwise the risk of a deeper and more persistent slowing in the economy would increase
5542316 on these considerations a case could be made for an early reduction in the cash rate
5542317 weighing up all these considerations members judged that the current stance of policy was appropriate for the time being
5542318 nonetheless given the slower trend in demand scope to move towards a less restrictive setting of monetary policy was judged to be increasing
5542319 broader measures that included job advertisements on the internet were also softening and employment intentions from a range of business surveys suggested employment growth would moderate in the period ahead
5542320 members continued to see considerable uncertainty about the outlook for demand and inflation as the economy remained subject to powerful forces pulling in opposite directions
5542321 tighter financial conditions were causing the economy to slow but on the other hand the rise in the terms of trade would continue to add more substantially to national income and capacity to spend

5542339 what sibel revealed to us and has been revealing little by little since january is that she has heard that there was a nuclear procurement ring operating inside the us to procure nuclear designs and parts for the aq khan network and it was done not through pakistani intelligence directly but through the turkish embassy turkish businessmen who got the information and gave it to turkish military attaches who then turned it over to the isi and from there went on to the nuclear black market to procure these parts and designs high government us officials helped facilitate turkish israeli phd students to get into nuclear facilities in the us they worked with the rand corporation as well some moles with rand to help get this information there was at least one american company giza technologies that was helping with parts probably there were others and this thing went on from 1995 at least until 2002 and it could still be going on when this operation was shut down by the dept of defense and the state dept now sibel tells us that high government officials inside those two departments defense and state were involved in this ring she has named them on her website at least she has not named them she has photographs of people other bloggers have named them

5542342 27 ye have heard that it was said by them of old time thou shalt not commit adultery 28 but i say unto you that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart
5542343 9 and i say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery
5542344 10 his disciples say unto him if the case of the man be so with his wife it is not good to marry
5542345 if such is the case with divorce and remarriage it is better to be single
5542346 if such is the case with divorce and remarriage it is better to be lost
5542347 9 and i say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery
5542348 12 for there are some eunuchs which were so born from their mothers womb and there are some eunuchs which were made eunuchs of men and there be eunuchs which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heavens sake he that is able to receive it let him receive it
5542349 29 and jesus answered and said verily i say unto you there is no man that hath left house or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my sake and the gospels 30 but he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time houses and brethren and sisters and mothers and children and lands with persecutions and in the world to come eternal life

5542353 1 now when these things were done the princes came to me saying the people of israel and the priests and the levites have not separated themselves from the people of the lands doing according to their abominations even of the canaanites the hittites the perizzites the jebusites the ammonites the moabites the egyptians and the amorites 2 for they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands yea the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass 3 and when i heard this thing i rent my garment and my mantle and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard and sat down astonied 4 then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the god of israel because of the transgression of those that had been carried away and i sat astonied until the evening sacrifice 5 and at the evening sacrifice i arose up from my heaviness and having rent my garment and my mantle i fell upon my knees and spread out my hands unto the lord my god 6 and said o my god i am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee my god for our iniquities are increased over our head and our trespass is grown up unto the heavens 7 since the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass unto this day and for our iniquities have we our kings and our priests been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands to the sword to captivity and to a spoil and to confusion of face as it is this day 8 and now for a little space grace hath been shewed from the lord our god to leave us a remnant to escape and to give us a nail in his holy place that our god may lighten our eyes and give us a little reviving in our bondage 9 for we were bondmen yet our god hath not forsaken us in our bondage but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of persia to give us a reviving to set up the house of our god and to repair the desolations thereof and to give us a wall in judah and in jerusalem 10 and now o our god what shall we say after this for we have forsaken thy commandments 11 which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets saying the land unto which ye go to possess it is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands with their abominations which have filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness 12 now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons neither take their daughters unto your sons nor seek their peace or their wealth for ever that ye may be strong and eat the good of the land and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever 13 and after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds and for our great trespass seeing that thou our god hast punished us less than our iniquities deserve and hast given us such deliverance as this 14 should we again break thy commandments and join in affinity with the people of these abominations wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou hadst consumed us so that there should be no remnant nor escaping 15 o lord god of israel thou art righteous for we remain yet escaped as it is this day behold we are before thee in our trespasses for we cannot stand before thee because of this
5542354 1 now when ezra had prayed and when he had confessed weeping and casting himself down before the house of god there assembled unto him out of israel a very great congregation of men and women and children for the people wept very sore 2 and shechaniah the son of jehiel one of the sons of elam answered and said unto ezra we have trespassed against our god and have taken strange wives of the people of the land yet now there is hope in israel concerning this thing 3 now therefore let us make a covenant with our god to put away all the wives and such as are born of them according to the counsel of my lord and of those that tremble at the commandment of our god and let it be done according to the law 4 arise for this matter belongeth unto thee we also will be with thee be of good courage and do it 5 then arose ezra and made the chief priests the levites and all israel to swear that they should do according to this word and they sware 6 then ezra rose up from before the house of god and went into the chamber of johanan the son of eliashib and when he came thither he did eat no bread nor drink water for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been carried away 7 and they made proclamation throughout judah and jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity that they should gather themselves together unto jerusalem 8 and that whosoever would not come within three days according to the counsel of the princes and the elders all his substance should be forfeited and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away 9 then all the men of judah and benjamin gathered themselves together unto jerusalem within three days it was the ninth month on the twentieth day of the month and all the people sat in the street of the house of god trembling because of this matter and for the great rain 10 and ezra the priest stood up and said unto them ye have transgressed and have taken strange wives to increase the trespass of israel 11 now therefore make confession unto the lord god of your fathers and do his pleasure and separate yourselves from the people of the land and from the strange wives 12 then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice as thou hast said so must we do 13 but the people are many and it is a time of much rain and we are not able to stand without neither is this a work of one day or two for we are many that have transgressed in this thing 14 let now our rulers of all the congregation stand and let all them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed times and with them the elders of every city and the judges thereof until the fierce wrath of our god for this matter be turned from us 15 only jonathan the son of asahel and jahaziah the son of tikvah were employed about this matter and meshullam and shabbethai the levite helped them 16 and the children of the captivity did so and ezra the priest with certain chief of the fathers after the house of their fathers and all of them by their names were separated and sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter 17 and they made an end with all the men that had taken strange wives by the first day of the first month 18 and among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken strange wives namely of the sons of jeshua the son of jozadak and his brethren maaseiah and eliezer and jarib and gedaliah 19 and they gave their hands that they would put away their wives and being guilty they offered a ram of the flock for their trespass 20 and of the sons of immer hanani and zebadiah 21 and of the sons of harim maaseiah and elijah and shemaiah and jehiel and uzziah 22 and of the sons of pashur elioenai maaseiah ishmael nethaneel jozabad and elasah 23 also of the levites jozabad and shimei and kelaiah the same is kelita pethahiah judah and eliezer 24 of the singers also eliashib and of the porters shallum and telem and uri 25 moreover of israel of the sons of parosh ramiah and jeziah and malchiah and miamin and eleazar and malchijah and benaiah 26 and of the sons of elam mattaniah zechariah and jehiel and abdi and jeremoth and eliah 27 and of the sons of zattu elioenai eliashib mattaniah and jeremoth and zabad and aziza 28 of the sons also of bebai jehohanan hananiah zabbai and athlai 29 and of the sons of bani meshullam malluch and adaiah jashub and sheal and ramoth 30 and of the sons of pahathmoab adna and chelal benaiah maaseiah mattaniah bezaleel and binnui and manasseh 31 and of the sons of harim eliezer ishijah malchiah shemaiah shimeon 33 of the sons of hashum mattenai mattathah zabad eliphelet jeremai manasseh and shimei 34 of the sons of bani maadai amram and uel 39 and shelemiah and nathan and adaiah 43 of the sons of nebo jeiel mattithiah zabad zebina jadau and joel benaiah 44 all these had taken strange wives and some of them had wives by whom they had children
5542355 1 and it came to pass that when jesus had finished these sayings he departed from galilee and came into the coasts of judaea beyond jordan 2 and great multitudes followed him and he healed them there 3 the pharisees also came unto him tempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause 4 and he answered and said unto them have ye not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female 5 and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh 6 wherefore they are no more twain but one flesh what therefore god hath joined together let not man put asunder 7 they say unto him why did moses then command to give a writing of divorcement and to put her away 8 he saith unto them moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so 9 and i say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery 10 his disciples say unto him if the case of the man be so with his wife it is not good to marry 11 but he said unto them all men cannot receive this saying save they to whom it is given 12 for there are some eunuchs which were so born from their mothers womb and there are some eunuchs which were made eunuchs of men and there be eunuchs which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heavens sake he that is able to receive it let him receive it

5542358 3 the pharisees also came unto him tempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause 4 and he answered and said unto them have ye not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female 5 and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh 6 wherefore they are no more twain but one flesh what therefore god hath joined together let not man put asunder 7 they say unto him why did moses then command to give a writing of divorcement and to put her away 8 he saith unto them moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so 9 and i say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery 10 his disciples say unto him if the case of the man be so with his wife it is not good to marry 11 but he said unto them all men cannot receive this saying save they to whom it is given 12 for there are some eunuchs which were so born from their mothers womb and there are some eunuchs which were made eunuchs of men and there be eunuchs which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heavens sake he that is able to receive it let him receive it
5542359 3 the pharisees also came unto him tempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause
5542360 20 for i say unto you that except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven
5542361 4 and he answered and said unto them have ye not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female 5 and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh 6 wherefore they are no more twain but one flesh what therefore god hath joined together let not man put asunder
5542362 4 and he answered and said unto them have ye not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female
5542363 27 so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them
5542364 24 therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh
5542365 he who made them at the beginning made them male and 4 and he answered and said unto them have ye not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female
5542366 24 therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh
5542367 5 and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh 6 wherefore they are no more twain but one flesh what therefore god hath joined together let not man put asunder
5542368 24 therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh
5542369 6 wherefore they are no more twain but one flesh what therefore god hath joined together let not man put asunder
5542370 7 they say unto him why did moses then command to give a writing of divorcement and to put her away
5542371 1 when a man hath taken a wife and married her and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes because he hath found some uncleanness in her then let him write her a bill of divorcement and give it in her hand and send her out of his house 2 and when she is departed out of his house she may go and be another mans wife 3 and if the latter husband hate her and write her a bill of divorcement and giveth it in her hand and sendeth her out of his house or if the latter husband die which took her to be his wife 4 her former husband which sent her away may not take her again to be his wife after that she is defiled for that is abomination before the lord and thou shalt not cause the land to sin which the lord thy god giveth thee for an inheritance
5542372 31 it hath been said whosoever shall put away his wife let him give her a writing of divorcement
5542373 4 her former husband which sent her away may not take her again to be his wife after that she is defiled for that is abomination before the lord and thou shalt not cause the land to sin which the lord thy god giveth thee for an inheritance
5542374 13 and a man lie with her carnally and it be hid from the eyes of her husband and be kept close and she be defiled and there be no witness against her neither she be taken with the manner 14 and the spirit of jealousy come upon him and he be jealous of his wife and she be defiled or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him and he be jealous of his wife and she be not defiled
5542375 32 but i say unto you that whosoever shall put away his wife saving for the cause of fornication causeth her to commit adultery and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery
5542376 8 he saith unto them moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so 9 and i say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery
5542377 27 for i know thy rebellion and thy stiff neck behold while i am yet alive with you this day ye have been rebellious against the lord and how much more after my death
5542378 10 and unto the married i command yet not i but the lord let not the wife depart from her husband 11 but and if she depart let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband and let not the husband put away his wife
5542379 9 and i say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery
5542380 20 teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you and lo i am with you always even unto the end of the world amen
5542381 9 and i say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery
5542382 32 but i say unto you that whosoever shall put away his wife saving for the cause of fornication causeth her to commit adultery and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery
5542383 5 and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh
5542384 6 wherefore they are no more twain but one flesh what therefore god hath joined together let not man put asunder
5542385 11 and he saith unto them whosoever shall put away his wife and marry another committeth adultery against her 12 and if a woman shall put away her husband and be married to another she committeth adultery
5542386 31 it hath been said whosoever shall put away his wife let him give her a writing of divorcement

5542389 but the city gave the developer broad easement rights to use that strip in developing and operating the marina
5542390 unfortunately this action by the city inadvertently deprived the developer of the ownership rights at the waterline that are necessary for an easement on submerged lands under n c general statute 146 12

5542419 i am sure that such a well done effective and peacemaking operation aimed at protecting our citizens and other people will be among the most glorious deeds of the russian military
5542420 what georgian authorities have done is beyond human understanding it cannot be understood and left unpunished
5542421 the world realized that even now there are political freaks who were ready to kill innocent people for the sake of political fashions and who compensated for their own stupidity by eliminating a whole nation
5542422 if someone thinks that our citizens can be killed soldiers and officers who are peacekeepers killed with impunity we will never permit that

5542449 indeed less restrictive conditions could soon be called for otherwise the risk of a deeper and more persistent slowing in the economy would increase the minutes said
5542450 on these considerations a case could be made for an early reduction in the cash rate
5542451 weighing up all considerations members judged that the current stance of policy was appropriate for the time being
5542452 nonetheless given the slower trend in demand scope to move towards a less restrictive setting of monetary policy was judged to be increasing
5542453 members were conscious that financial conditions were clearly quite tight and effectively getting tighter as a result of ongoing pressure on lenders costs of funds in the market the minutes said
5542454 given there had been a significant change in borrowing behaviour confidence was weaker asset prices had declined and slower overall growth was in prospect tighter financial conditions were not warranted
5542455 firstly a lengthy period of inflation above the target was occurring with attendant risk that this would begin to affect wage setting though there was no evidence of this in aggregate wages data to date the minutes said
5542456 if that occurred the cost of reducing inflation later would be greater
5542457 policy had to take account of this risk particularly given both the recent high cpi reading and those in prospect in the near term
5542458 the staff forecast for growth had been revised down slightly while that for inflation was slightly higher in the near term but still saw inflation starting to fall back towards the target during 2009 and 2010 the minutes said
5542459 the staff forecast for growth of the australian economy over the year ahead had been lowered slightly and remained below consensus the minutes said
5542460 it was likely that the headline rate of inflation would rise further in the immediate future but the softer demand outlook meant that inflation was still forecast to decline during 2009 and to be consistent with the target during 2010
5542461 clear evidence of that decline beginning however was unlikely to be seen for a while yet
5542462 the national accounts for the june quarter to be published in early september were likely to show that growth of gdp had been low and the staff forecasts suggested that a weak outcome in the september quarter was also possible the minutes said
5542463 members continued to see considerable uncertainty about the outlook for demand and inflation as the economy remained subject to powerful forces pulling in opposite directions the minutes said
5542464 tighter financial conditions were causing the economy to slow but on the other hand the rise in the terms of trade would continue to add substantially to national income and capacity to spend

5542475 the act has been amended several times earlier the last one was in 2005 but we have decided to bring another amendment considering the changing pattern of lifestyle and business in the last few years
5542476 in the existing act the owner of a building can be arrested if he violates the law we have arrested a few of them in calcutta recently but somehow they managed to get bail within a short period we will plug the loopholes in the amendment

5542478 we have held several round of discussions with the nhpc authorities on the issue but they seem to be taking the matter lightly the existing road which has collapsed due to the dams construction is the lifeline for the near 50 000 population at takdah block and hence until the nhpc takes some concrete step in this regard we would not allow any work at the tldp site
5542479 but the problem is that the area through which the near 500 metre alternative road stretch is to pass happens to be forest land we have requested the state forest department to spare us the required land but the matter is still pending with them
5542480 being a forest area the nhpc authorities will have to apply for the land to us in a specified format the application would then be forwarded to the union ministry of environment and forests through the state forest authorities for consideration and only after the union ministry approval the land can be transferred for the construction of an alternative road

5542521 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5542522 ive got a generator and ive got a concrete home that i built myself so i know it can withstand this

5542532 any political transition in pakistan will have no effect on pakistans nuclear assets because it has a very strong custodial control
5542533 the reality is that pakistans government exists on different levels one of the levels it exists and works at is in the control of its nuclear weapons
5542534 where it does not work is in providing effective services jobs education and health that people need
5542535 pakistans nuclear arsenal is in the hands of the army and the army is not changing hands so whatever the situation was before is largely what it will continue to be
5542536 if pakistan becomes a more fragile and even failing state then the nuclear assets will be everybodys problem internationally the best way to prevent that from happening is in strengthening the new governments ability to govern

5542543 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5542544 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5542545 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5542546 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority
5542547 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies
5542548 if so many of the peppers we eat in the u s come in from
5542549 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obama s varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge

5542551 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5542552 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5542553 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5542554 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home
5542555 the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5542556 sometimes its difficult to know what a politician will actually do once in office because they say different things at different times to different people

5542586 sometimes it is difficult to know what a politician will actually do once in office because they say different things at different times to different people
5542587 this is a particular problem when a candidate has a short thin record on the issues as in the case of senator obama let me say just in case senator obama does decide to return to his original plan of cutting nasa funding i oppose such cuts
5542588 i will ensure that space exploration remains a top priority and that the u s continues to lead the world in this field

5542632 i think that the reason why open innovation goes so deep can be explained by two things first new science has shown how diversity in essential to novelty which also maps how gene pools work if you want a new strain of corn you cant do that with a single clone of corn you need lots of kinds of corn if you want new thoughts you need lots of kinds of thinkers
5542633 there is a second reason why open innovation is growing so rapidly right now weve been through a period of about five years in which companies got extremely lean and reduced their investments in the new and the innovative so now we have ended up with companies which are low on diversity and high on efficiency and not particularly innovative so suddenly now growth is more important innovation is more important but how are we going to do it well the fastest and best way is to look outside the walls of the organization for a diverse set of resources that can help
5542634 if the recapitalization talk is realized there are no assurances that the securities that have been issued by u s mortgage firms will be 100 percent guaranteed

5542642 you dont communicate ideas if you write high court judgments in the way that the high court justices did in my time just think of my time in law school i had to sit there reading page after page without a single paragraph

5542644 the biggest difference between what weborb provides and what rubyamf only amf alternative i am aware of provides is workflow weborb is a great product written by guys who do java primarily so it follows the patterns of having a service layer that connects you to your application rubyamf is written by a ruby developer
5542645 but some at the oxnard junior high school had seen larry 15 teased by students in the weeks before the shooting for being gay and wearing high heeled boots and makeup some witnessed confrontations between larry and brandon with larry teasing brandon and saying he liked him
5542646 larry didnt just take it if kids didnt want to have contact with a gay person larry would chase after them
5542647 brandon spent most of his childhood and where his parents had some of their most violent fights according to divorce and other court records
5542648 in december 2001 brandon moved into his fathers house full time after william filed for a restraining order to protect himself and brandon saying kendra had back handed brandon more than once and scratched him on the chest according to court records
5542649 some people would walk up to him and hed say something back it would be random like at lunch whats with the makeup weird stuff like that
5542650 that coalition includes the american civil liberties union of southern california equality california gay straight alliance network lambda legal the los angeles gay and lesbian center the national center for lesbian rights the national gay and lesbian task force and the transgender law center
5542651 brandons friend lauren said the rumors about larry hitting on brandon were heating up kids were joking that brandon must be gay if larry was acting that way toward him
5542652 the principal called my wife on the phone and she was crying
5542653 she found the book and said we needed to do something to help protect larry
5542654 impression on the world as a kid who insisted on being himself even if it meant being ridiculed

5542659 there has been a lot of misinformation printed by the oregonian regarding my trip to cuba here are the facts
5542660 to help farmers move into brick houses from wood and earth residences and nomadic herders to settle down

5542664 the clock is ticking for the chinese government to demonstrate its good faith regarding these so called protest zones
5542665 we think that you do not really understand chinas reality china has its own version and way of exercising our democracy
5542666 justifiable concerns about the whereabouts and safety of those individuals
5542667 china is presenting itself as a place with democratic freedoms where everyone has the right to protest even during the olympics but in reality the protest permits wont be granted
5542668 i have lived all over since i became homeless including tunnels warehouses on the street and the houses of friends and relatives

5542674 certainly now what we want to see in pakistan is a period of political stability to enable the government and the parliament of pakistan to address the serious issues that pakistan faces including security issues mr smith told abc radio today

5542677 weve learned that wherever you are you watch on the biggest screen you can
5542678 it encourages viewers and provides them with information there will be no dilution or fragmentation of the national audience
5542679 if you watched the olympics in high definition on a big screen you are not going to watch it online so that is why there isnt going to be a cannibalization

5542683 were not taking in people that are noncompliant or who are trying to get in here just to get out of doing the 90 days in jail
5542684 were taking in people that we believe have a sincere commitment to turning their lives around and getting sober
5542685 instead of just sitting in jail and stewing about the mistakes i had made it forced me to make some lifestyle changes
5542686 we want them to change their behavior so that they realize some of the different consequences
5542687 you really have to make sure youre here on time

5542694 la cantidad de lombrices que aparezcan muertas es un factor determinante para saber la magnitud epicentro y profundidad del terremoto
5542695 pero a n no existe una manera fiel y definitiva de probarlo
5542696 una especie de sonidos o vibraciones en las entra as de la tierra cuando las placas tect nicas tienen apenas sus primeras fricciones las hace huir a las lombrices a buscar la muerte en la intemperie

5542742 were about two things here one is ensuring that the needs of our kids are met to be educated well and the other is to be sensitive to taxpayers going forward
5542743 were not making any assumptions or being cavalier about any of this
5542744 were going to do our best if the board approves this plan or whatever plan they approve to educate the community regarding this need and do a thorough job of providing people information i think thats our responsibility both to the kids of this school district as well as to the taxpayers
5542745 weve talked all along about the balance with the community on one hand with the economic times and the need to provide our students with a strong education and how do you balance that
5542746 i think the superintendent has come back with a proposal that does a good job at that balance
5542747 i am very much leaning toward that whole puzzle because i think it does take into account the taxpayers in our school district right now i think the plans as they laid out are something that we could potentially move forward with
5542748 whether its his last game or not this week well wait and see because with the amount of injuries weve got he will probably be forced to play against geelong assistant coach peter sumich said

5542750 strong possibility to return from a rolled ankle but veteran david wirrpanda hamstring was only a 50 50 chance
5542751 i went and watched him yesterday against richmond 3 6 and one out on the full sumich said
5542752 geez if he has 10 shots on goal this week hopefully he does kick 3
5542753 it would be great to have a little bit of help because i think you have to be a special type of person to beat him one on one sumich said
5542754 if he gets his 10 opportunities one on one well hes probably going to win his 50 per cent of them but the 50 per cent will result in two or three goals straight away so you need a bit of help
5542755 the kids all know how to do it and maybe itd get to them quicker than a phone call
5542756 i think its fine anything to get the crime off the street

5542789 patient who is 480lbs fell from standing position and landed on his back we attempted to get plain films of his back our scanner has a weight limit of 350lbs so we could not scan the patient my partner tried for about 4 hours to find someone with a scanner that could hold a 500lb man the patient was signed out pending our vet school calling us back to see if we could scan him by the vet radiologist

5542791 this is not pshradio although we talk more ps3 then they do
5542792 it will get a women on the ticket that shares the same views as obama
5542793 its wrong and shocking that some doctors felt their religious beliefs allowed them to ignore the law and discriminate
5542794 this isnt just a win for me personally and for other lesbian women its a win for everyone
5542795 i wish they had sidewalks this is a very busy street and this is a road known for accidents
5542796 a case could be made for an early reduction in the cash rate
5542797 indeed less restrictive conditions could soon be called for otherwise the risk of a deeper and more persistent slowing in the economy would increase
5542798 some people are talking about a 50 basis point cut this would put a bit of a dampener on that which is a positive for the aussie dollar
5542799 it doesnt have the degree of urgency which would suggest that the reserve bank sees itself about to embark on a 50 basis point move or a huge reduction in interest rates by the end of the year
5542800 that in turn is pretty supportive for the australian dollar in the short term
5542801 it just doesnt seem to be fair that this is how we react but that is what we seem to be doing
5542802 the sale will now allow primary to focus on its core business and to progress with the integration of symbions medical centre pathology and radiology businesses primarys managing director edmund bateman said

5542807 australian special forces observed the airstrike which struck the taliban extremist group killing mullah akhtar mohammed
5542808 it occurred in broad daylight making concealment of the patrol difficult it was in an extremely remote area of the province and mullah akhtar mohammed was difficult to pinpoint as he travelled within a very small group
5542809 lamento quem n o confirmou presen a perde a democracia perde o eleitor o debate tem papel fundamental para levar propostas possivelmente eles s o candidatos que n o t m propostas
5542810 por conta de candidatos que n o atendem o chamamento da democracia tivemos o cancelamento do debate na tv gazeta

5542812 obama tem muito em comum com s rgio os dois t m terra sob as unhas
5542813 s rgio disse uma vez que o medo um mau conselheiro e algum tempo depois obama afirmou em um discurso que o medo d maus conselhos os dois tinham pontos de vista muito parecidos sobre como o medo pode afetar o julgamento
5542814 s rgio queria entender o mal e n o perdo lo ou venc lo como o presidente george w bush prega

5542818 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5542819 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5542820 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5542821 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5542822 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5542823 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5542824 the twins sent boswell back to minnesota and we didnt see him for 10 12 days tony oliva said
5542825 ive been hearing that im overworked but i havent felt that way
5542826 to say i was overworked that would be an excuse thats not at all legitimate
5542827 i had a rough stretch last year not as long as this one maybe but i got through it and im confident ill get through this were looking at a road trip thats going to be a big challenge and i want to get back to being a good pitcher for this team again
5542828 matt has to do it for us the manager said
5542829 ive been going over everything looking at tapes trying to find the problem he said

5542852 protecting the ancient and historical sites is our most important task
5542853 thus if we dont have any appropriate plan to protect the excavated site the sites should be once again covered by earth after the experts carry out studies on them
5542854 yes youre right lets stop talking about how angry we are that women worry about being raped and start talking about how angry we are that men worry about being falsely accused of rape
5542855 whups just kidding lets restore that status quo its still all about me
5542856 let me tell you internet it is tough being a white man
5542857 thats gods business and i dont think i can do that

5542860 this isnt new territory not yet at least at this point the washington nationals need more than just a routine fiasco to blaze a trail into the latest frontier of losing
5542861 im not tired i may be tired of losing its very frustrating to go out there and the team goes out there and puts six runs on the board and i cant continue the ballgame im tired of that im not physically tired
5542862 the common thread is 2008 thats the only common thing about it its been unbelievable thats the only way i can describe it i was kind of joking about it with somebody even with gonzalez who was coming from the outside he just got here and he already got hurt and so thats the only thing we do a tremendous job preparing these guys our strength and conditioning people are great theres nothing related with their conditioning its been weird
5542863 well it depends on when hes finished getting his diabetes in order because hell have just so many days to get in playing shape and also its gonna be a little tougher too because the minor leagues are gone at the end of this month that doesnt mean that a guy wont be able to come back and well do some simulated games over here and all that but it depends on when hes done controlling his diabetes
5542864 ayala being a type c free agent this year and the nats would not be compensated if he walked
5542865 im surprised i thought it was too late to be traded
5542866 i had my best times here i say thank you for supporting me for six years i have great moments to remember here
5542867 at nissan pavilion in bristow va that had the likes of slipknot disturbed mastodon and machinehead
5542868 we were extremely competitive trying to sign him we offered a major league contract
5542869 we were there doing everything we could to sign the player obviously were very disappointed
5542870 what they told us was we want a major league contract and we want a quote unquote out of the box deal we gave them a major league contract and gave them an out of the box deal
5542871 ha ha the nats are on a seven game losing streak
5542872 the last week or so we went from playing really well to going back to where we were in san francisco and los angeles
5542873 you cant explain it we just have to keep working hard we know what we have to do to win so we keep working at that
5542874 i pushed it kind of close i accomplished my job and i get to run tomorrow top two is favored and that is the main focus because you get inside lanes for the next rounds
5542875 i walked out of the tunnel and onto the track and i started to cry
5542876 i had first attempt makes up until my personal record so we went to a pole i havent been on except for a little bit in practice
5542877 to go through what i went through and be back on top again im just so blessed right now
5542878 they had guys in 68 that didnt make the team that could whip this team im not taking anything away from these young athletes but i dont think they have anywhere near the depth we had
5542879 i came to the birds nest to lay a golden egg and thats what i did
5542880 i am surprised we havent won more gold but you know what i hope this sets a trend
5542881 i had a lot of people in my corner encouraging me and looking after me
5542882 then i found out it was brazil and i was cheering in the doping control room
5542883 we have so many goal scorers and i think thats what is the most amazing thing were so unpredictable and this whole team isnt about one person were so unified and so strong and were going to take that with us to the final
5542884 everybody in this room could be donating to some other cause or to their own well being but i want to thank you
5542885 faced with the embarrassing prospect of holding a fundraiser with one of s closest associates the mccain campaign scrambled today to scratch ralph reed from tonights program but voters deserve to know the answers to the real questions raised by reeds involvement
5542886 if the mccain campaign wont return the money reed has raised for them then voters should rightly ask why it matters that reed didnt show up at tonights event the real question isnt why reed isnt showing up but why a so called reformer would invite him at all
5542887 before the obama campaign launches attacks they should stop and think about the amount of money that has been raised through convicted criminal and longtime fundraiser tony rezko
5542888 it takes a lot of audacity for obama and his spokespeople to criticize when obama was involved in a questionable home purchase with rezkos wife and years of friendship and dealings with a man convicted of wire and mail fraud money laundering and aiding and abetting bribery
5542889 not only the lives of the offenders because a lot of those people are out of control alcoholic and their fate if they dont get help is an untimely death were also protecting society from the worst of the worst of the drunken drivers
5542890 locking somebody up to punish them and doing nothing to address the underlying behavior is costing the taxpayers 7 000 to 8 000
5542891 were not taking in people that are noncompliant or who are trying to get in here just to get out of doing the 90 days in jail
5542892 were taking in people that we believe have a sincere commitment to turning their lives around and getting sober
5542893 instead of just sitting in jail and stewing about the mistakes i had made it forced me to make some lifestyle changes
5542894 we want them to change their behavior so that they realize some of the different consequences

5542896 this is a very young calf its probably two to three weeks old it absolutely needs its mother or another whale to adopt it
5542897 its heart wrenching normally whales stay very very close to their mothers theyre inseparable and they suckle for 11 months before being weaned
5542898 we managed to coax it out to sea yesterday by towing a yacht
5542899 the sad news is this morning its returned the last sighting was mackerel beach in pittwater
5542900 weve got some folks out there at the moment trying to assess its condition but the fact that it went out to sea yesterday there were whales in the vicinity but its come back in again its pretty sad news
5542901 it would suggest that its not been able to make contact with those whales or they werent interested in it
5542902 its probably a question of days rather than weeks its a very grim prognosis
5542903 if a lactating female with a calf goes past and this calf approaches that animal it may accept it but its a very slim chance
5542904 this is a very young calf it amp squo s probably two to three weeks old it absolutely needs its mother or another whale to adopt it

5542928 radek volunteers regularly for predators community outreach programs such as big brothers and chat with a predator chat with a predator if a very popular format that allows fans the opportunity for online conversation directly with members of the predators organization because of his limited english radek usually had help from one of his teammates in case radek had a question of language or grammar fellow predator forward and good friend vernon fiddler was assisting radek when fiddler received a cell phone call owing to poor reception inside the building fiddler explained to radek that he was going outside to take the call
5542929 so i like well you know got on google sure enough i found like a whole organization of predators boy was i like surprised to find predators so blatantly organized you know with like their own chat server and stuff
5542930 radek was waiting for vernon fiddler to return from his cell call when the instant message came in
5542931 you have to understand that radek had previously been with vernon on several hospital and home visitations to present very ill and dying children with gift baskets from the predators organization when the message from sick 4bigstik popped up radek responded as best he could radek actually thought by the manner in which the child was begging that the child was close to death radek wrote down the address the child gave him radek then located vernon fiddler in the parking lot and insisted that vernon drive him right away to the childs house vernon told radek that they should wait until daylight but radek insisted that they must go right away
5542932 the predator guy was so hot for my little cooze he like drove over to see me right away
5542933 he was like tall and good looking and i felt like you know kinda bad in a way but in another way the guy had seemed pretty damn proud to be a predator and hes like telling me his name is bonk if you can believe that so i thought you know like fuck bonk and the hummer he rode in on
5542934 they heard amanda bellings giggle belllings then told them she wasnt expecting two predators and to come inside and wait in the living room while she finished her shower radek and vernon came in and took a seat vernon found bellings flirtacious but disembodied voice odd and was calling the predators community relations director when chris hansen walked into the living room and melodramatically introduced himself
5542935 you are such a smart boy with potential and if you make more efforts you will be always on top
5542936 i have signed three decrees including one on the resignation of the government another on proclamation of a state of emergency in south ossetia and the third on setting up an emergency committee to settle the consequences of the georgian aggression

5542941 components of the financing plan include general obligation bonds secured by hotel motel tax revenues and annual county commitments from the general fund
5542942 a tax exempt general obligation bond issuance is planned to generate 52 0 million in proceeds for the construction of the project the issuance will be secured by an increase to the existing hotel motel tax as well as an annual contribution from the countys general fund
5542943 the financing plan includes a 12 0 million contribution from the lucas county capital projects fund while the current fund balance of 26 9 million is sufficient to support the contribution the county has made no formal commitment to assign or allocate 12 0 million of the fund to the project the formal commitment on the part of the county is a recommended condition necessary for the payment of state funds
5542944 but the cost has swelled to 105 million from the initial estimate of 85 million commissioner pete gerken said the cost increase is due to the increase in the structures size from about 235 000 square feet to 275 000 square feet the additional space allows for extra party rooms and viewing suites which are expected to increase revenues he said the increased cost will be covered by revenues generated by the arena mr gerken said the arena will be paid for by an increase in the hotel motel tax state contributions revenues from ticket sales rental fees sales of naming rights and luxury suites and borrowing on the bond market
5542945 i dont want to get tied down with a specific price and wind up getting shortchanged we know what our base budget is so as we go beyond that the arena has to pay for itself
5542946 the consultant considers the county to be proceeding at significant risk by commencing construction without having confirmed the project resources or executed the leases and managements agreements noted above
5542947 formal and irrevocable commitments for all sources must be provided at terms equal to or better than that provided to date to meet commission guidelines and support approval of the project these risks are compounded by the county proceeding with construction without confirmed funding or agreements in place
5542948 5 per event fee for a third of the turnstile attendance per event including both tenant and non tenant events
5542949 it is unclear however where the spaces are located who owns the spaces and what agreements are in place to ensure that parking revenues associated with events at the facility are collected
5542950 ive done nothing wrong please just stay out of my life
5542951 this visit helps build maritime cooperation and cultural understanding between the united states and malaysia
5542952 were all pretty excited to visit a modern vibrant city like kuala lumpur
5542953 our sailors plan to do some sightseeing and shopping in this magnificent country
5542954 theyll also make a positive impact for the needy ashore
5542955 there are a number of us who are private pilots who still get flying time in some way
5542956 we know that predator is critical to the nations defense
5542957 so its not a one way door that you go into predator and thats where you are for the rest of your career
5542958 you go down the list and everyone has a different reason for it
5542959 maybe they wanted to be closer to home yet still serve in the warfight
5542960 i fly commercially on the outside so this is the opportunity to do a mission that affects whats going on with the war every day but i still get to fly
5542961 we just got back from operation iraqi freedom doing close air support with the f 16 now we are going to do the same mission with the mq 9
5542962 looking from our perspective its really essential for the initial cadre to come from a background where they are familiar with the mission
5542963 the seasoned aviators are the people the guard brings to this fight and are exactly the people needed in the predator
5542964 not just tactically but in the flying sense the more seasoned the better
5542965 how can you be tired all you do is sleep and eat
5542966 youre going to think im ridiculous but this place is overpriced
5542967 because these youth are extremely vulnerable to exploitation by adult criminals
5542968 has directed the juvenile probation department in no uncertain terms
5542969 ultimately the decisions must be made by the mayor and that is where the buck stops
5542970 the mayor can accept it or not that is his prerogative
5542971 are we a sanctuary city are we not a sanctuary city
5542972 we shouldnt make knee jerk reactions or abrupt decisions we need to have a healthy discussion
5542973 with their family and in their community in san francisco
5542974 we are saying we should treat juveniles as juveniles regardless of their status
5542975 we had a hearing we had a roomful of different organizations representing various immigrant groups from people dealing with juvenile law

5542988 after the success of our last two movie contests there was no hesitation in bringing this classic event back for another run

5542990 being that we are a minority majority community one in two is a very scary thing
5542991 it dies a lot of times because manufacturers of junk food advocate it
5542992 we have to get a mentality for people to think about these types of things
5542993 a complex attack defense control point map with some unique gameplay unlike most tf2 maps capturing a control point modifies the layout of the map opening and closing routes for each team as a result the offensive team has a wide variety of tactical choices around how theyd like to assault the final point should they use scouts and soldiers to rush the final point with only the routes they start with should they go for the side control points and open up more routes to the final should they capture extra points to shut down the defenders routes the many choices keep the map interesting for a long time providing a wide variety of experiences in a game
5542994 the unlockable for the heaviest pugilists out there is the k g b any time a heavy kills an enemy with the k g b he receives five seconds of guaranteed critical hits this crit boost can be used to punch and kill further enemies extending the boost time alternatively the heavy can switch to another weapon and use the boost to take out an enemy at range the heavys slow movement speed and the k g bs slower swing speed make it a risky prospect
5542995 the heavys second unlockable natascha slows enemies with her bullets anyone damaged by her will move slower for an instant encouraging them to find cover or turn and face the heavy mano a tiny itty bitty mano unfortunately natascha is slightly weaker than sasha so she takes longer to finish off a victim as a result nataschas great against fleeing cowards such as scouts amp medics and less great against anyone actively trying to kill her master heavies that like to jump around corners and surprise groups of startled enemy crybabies will also find her very useful although they should look for a sasha wielding enemy heavy before they leap

5543011 canadian professional chuckwagon association competitors lost seven outriding horses and the pull horse of mine
5543012 thats eight head of horse that we had to put down this weekend on this track
5543013 we were too close so i couldnt get around him
5543014 it was lucky mitsuings wagon didnt veer left or it would have been a big mess
5543015 the other two gorst and waldenbach had infractions when they left the start
5543016 i guess its a win but its not how i wanted to win it
5543017 if it wasnt for the misfortune i would have had the pcs championship
5543018 this is the worst track weve ran on all season
5543019 the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
5543020 they need to resurface the whole thing if they are going to keep running horses on it
5543021 i was going to quit but instead of quitting i decided to go over there to the cpca for a year
5543022 i wanted to go to new venues meet new people and show the people my face instead of on tv its been great so far
5543023 in the wpca youve just got more top end competitors
5543024 the cpca still has lots of good drivers and lots of tough drivers but theres a few more of them in the wpca

5543027 to say i was overworked that would be an excuse thats not at all legitimate
5543028 i had a rough stretch last year not as long as this one maybe but i got through it and im confident ill get through this were looking at a road trip thats going to be a big challenge and i want to get back to being a good pitcher for this team again
5543029 matt has to do it for us the manager said
5543030 ive been going over everything looking at tapes trying to find the problem he said

5543038 i looked at this man of god and thought to myself what lunatic asylum did he escape from i had never encountered someone like this mr mueller i said do you realize how dense the fog is no he replied
5543039 he then knelt down and prayed one of the most simple prayers ive ever heard when he had finished i started to pray but he put his hand on my shoulder and told me
5543040 as i looked as him he said captain i have known my lord for fifty seven years and there has never been even a single day that i have failed to get an audience with the king get up captain and open the door and you will see that the fog is gone i got up and indeed the fog was gone and on saturday afternoon george mueller was in quebec for his meeting

5543042 these measures all add up to a very significant package we are talking of about maybe s 700 million a year if more babies are born it will be more than s 700 million a year but even that is about double of what we are spending today on child incentives and all together we will have about s 1 6 billion spent a year or 0 6 per cent of gdp

5543062 i did give documents a long time ago but these matters have been resolved for a long time now as far as im concerned
5543063 the resignation came to my office today and i have signed it
5543064 the president may by writing under his hand addressed to the speaker of the national assembly resign his office
5543065 an election to fill a vacancy in the office of president shall be held not later than thirty days from the occurrence of the vacancy
5543066 i congratulate the people of pakistan on the peaceful resolution of their political crisis and i applaud the decision of president musharraf to give up his office for the good of his nation
5543067 the two major parties in the governing coalition the ppp and the pml n worked together to bring about a change in government through constitutional and nonviolent means
5543068 i urge pakistans leaders to focus now on the pressing challenges of the future and resist the temptation to settle scores of the past president musharraf made the right choice in stepping down i hope his resignation marks the end of the political turmoil that has immobilized the pakistani government in recent months
5543069 i am heartened by the reconciliation of the leading political parties in pakistan and their decision to break the deadlock which has virtually immobilized the pakistani government in recent months the political future of president musharraf is a matter to be decided by the pakistani people through normal constitutional channels i urge the parties the pakistani military and president musharraf to resolve this crisis within the bounds of pakistani law and i urge the bush administration to refrain from any actions which might appear to thwart the will of the pakistani people
5543070 the people of pakistan have spoken clearly and decisively for a transition from a decade of dictatorship to democracy in the february 18th 2008 elections it is time for general pervez musharraf to accept the mandate of the people for democratic change and step down for the sake of his nation
5543071 free from the threat of a president without legitimacy and popular support the new democratically elected government of pakistan can devote its full attention to the economic energy and food crises facing the nation and the growing threat of extremism
5543072 the immediate step after musharrafs departure should be the restoration of the old independent judiciary without getting the judges back on the supreme court and high court benches pakistan cannot move forward and make the progress it needs
5543073 as a member of the state and foreign operations subcommittee of the house appropriations committee i believe it is critical for pakistan to turn the page toward democracy good governance and effective anti terrorism
5543074 members of pakistans punjab province local assemblys vote today continues to pressure president pervez musharraf to leave office
5543075 today in pakistan the judges removed by musharraf have yet to be restored inflation is at an all time high and clashes occur frequently in tribal areas between pakistan forces and taliban insurgents
5543076 in order to re establish the rule of law return the supreme court and high court judges to their official posts and get back to solving the day to day challenges of the pakistani people president musharraf should strongly take into consideration the will of the pakistani people and step down
5543077 i have great respect admiration and affection for the pakistani people i have spoken out many times in the u s senate for closer ties between the people of the u s and the people of pakistan i count among my friends and leaders in different pakistani political parties my hope is for a better life for all pakistani people under a rule of law in free open democratic society
5543078 usually youre unlucky enough to have eight through a whole summer
5543079 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
5543080 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
5543081 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
5543082 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
5543083 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
5543084 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
5543085 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
5543086 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
5543087 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
5543088 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
5543089 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
5543090 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
5543091 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention
5543092 there will be a precipitous slowdown in global growth and that means a lot less demand for things like energy and base metals
5543093 it would be insane to step in and buy oil or metals now these markets will be vulnerable for the next four of five months
5543094 whether that is a final peak or an intermediate peak followed by higher prices we dont know yet it could go lower
5543095 theres a perception that demand for commodities might be weakening
5543096 north america and western europe are struggling but the emerging economies remain strong
5543097 its not just a u s problem its a global problem and its taking its toll on commodities
5543098 opec will remain firmly in control of the oil market for at least the next decade
5543099 longer term we would not be surprised to see gold double
5543100 we would be aggressive buyers at current levels expecting gold to work higher through 2009 10
5543101 george we see the worst inflation numbers in 17 years food is running on empty theres a threat of global war which could go global and all these other pressures so why isnt the price of gold going through the roof and making us rich
5543102 im a journalist for a belgian business magazine i read your comments on your discussion with your friend in the hedge fund business who is about to write a book at one moment you say before thanksgiving i might take a position long gold commodities in the light of the discussion because some serious money could enter this trade or something like that before that the whole discussion was about the deleveraging of the hedge fund business acting in lock step black boxes my question is why wouldnt the opposite happen may be they have too much leveraged positions in gold commodities can i quote you on the answer

5543124 my home state just doesnt seem to know how to party
5543125 ive been embarrassed by the lack of support for the sesquicentennial
5543126 and i want to celebrate the place i grew up in minnesotans have passion about their state you can see im a vikings fan by the number of super bowl rings im wearing
5543127 i wanted to celebrate minnesotas history its spirit its troubles and its promise
5543128 i think its all in there the spirit and the spit its been like pulling teeth to get this far but here we go
5543129 im just a minnesota boy who loves minnesota and wants to wave its flag
5543130 even at two hours you cant tell the whole story
5543131 but my songs come from a minnesota throat and i think we have captured the state pretty good

5543139 more consistent pound the zone if you can show guys youre ahead in the zone theyre going to swing at pitches early in the count that arent necessarily good pitches to hit i was able to do that tonight
5543140 ill be honest i didnt know a lot about him before i got here
5543141 but its pretty obvious to me after being here that hes one of the better pitchers in this league
5543142 thats part of my job driving in runs and youve got to have guys on base to do that
5543143 its a testament to those guys im just trying to be a complement to the puzzle
5543144 probably the biggest struggle ive had all season with my stuff
5543145 my fastball command was not there i walked a lot of guys it might have been the toughest outing of the season for me as far as laboring i had to work hard to get through five and get a couple more
5543146 weve been coming back all year long and so were expecting one of those games
5543147 youre not going to win them all but obviously thats one of the better teams in the american league east and the american league for that matter theyve got a great bullpen and lester gave them a great start tonight
5543148 people are frustrated and apprehensive and are saying what can we do to make it right
5543149 said roy louis an adviser with the samson first nation
5543150 we need to work together to come up with long term solutions against the gangs the drugs and the violence but our community has to take charge
5543151 these communities have to recognize that they have a problem with some of these young people that are out there with their gang ties and this lifestyle with drugs and the violence and they can go home to grandma and grandma will accept them and love them unconditionally chief supt
5543152 well the grandmas and other community leaders have to stop and say wait a minute
5543153 the hardened criminals and the entrenched gang members are committing these crimes and they are committing violence and they are hurting the community terribly
5543154 we have to balance that on the other hand with the fact that we have a lot of people involved in gangs who may be rehabilitated they are our people they are our children they are our community members our relatives and it may look simple and easy from someone on the outside but to us it isnt that simple
5543155 no puedes poner a la misma altura la creencia basada en la raz n y la credulidad
5543156 it came in through all three doors that i have
5543157 a half inch or an inch and were in trouble
5543158 were the only industry of this size and scope that doesnt have a real voice in this process at best were humored at worst were ignored
5543159 is it making our community stronger or are we trapped in that model
5543160 the philanthropic dollars provide us the money to experiment and try new things
5543161 philanthropy can fail in a way that government cant but we can catalyze government investment in growing what works
5543162 there are a lot of people in this sector who will get nervous about the federal government becoming too engaged in philanthropy
5543163 but theres also this other argument that we dont want an agency that is going to over regulate us
5543164 we in the south pacific take democracy seriously which is why we believe we cant sit idly by while our principles of democracy are shredded

5543167 i realised that i hear about these secret celebrity marriages the day after they happen and i dont think anybody is really trying to have a truly secret marriage but most of the fans and most of the media dont even know that im married
5543168 it can be a total secret theres no reason why the helicopters have to show up we were originally gonna do it on a public beach some place until we found out you have to register to do that and get a permit so immediately theyd call up the media and the paparazzi would be showing up

5543185 i am surprised we havent won more gold but you know what i hope this sets a trend
5543186 it was a hard play at the plate where we lost our starting catcher
5543187 just hard baseball thats all but i thought the other slide by schierholtz was too high in the states you try to do that youre ejected he ejected me from the game and the umpire let the game get away thats all there was to it
5543188 i figured thered be a play and he blocked the plate so i did what i had to do to score the run
5543189 it was a close game at the time and weve been playing close games so i knew we needed the run i wasnt trying to take him out
5543190 my left shoulders still bad from having to run over catchers that were in front of home plate
5543191 you slide into them theyve got shin guards thats even worse
5543192 it was pretty brutal to throw at a guys head
5543193 we would have charged for sure no question you hit five guys and you hit one of our leaders youre gonna pay for it but its a little different here i guess the tempers were high and i dont know what the implications for everything are here
5543194 we do not throw to hit people we dont teach that in china we dont teach that in the united states
5543195 he tried to throw the ball inside and it got away from him

5543242 each infelicitous remark or risky attack made by mccain or his campaign will be attributed to that roguish sense of humor
5543243 although people have been charged there is still a lot of work to do and other lines of inquiry that need to be followed up
5543244 the investigators have made a significant stride and hopefully this dreadful case is coming to its conclusion
5543245 all i will say is that my client maintains his innocence
5543246 we were informed this morning of the news from antigua and we are pleased at how the investigation is progressing
5543247 the most important event so far of the 2008 campaign

5543250 john mccain has had to make bigger more momentous decisions in his life than has barack obama
5543251 i f you want a president who knows the details of policy on the one hand and thinks the world is complicated on the other you would vote for
5543252 seriously underestimated how saturdays religious forum was made to order for mccain despite the perceptions that mccain rarely talks openly about his faith

5543262 this is a very young calf its probably two to three weeks old it absolutely needs its mother or another whale to adopt it
5543263 its heart wrenching normally whales stay very very close to their mothers theyre inseparable and they suckle for 11 months before being weaned
5543264 we managed to coax it out to sea yesterday by towing a yacht
5543265 the sad news is this morning its returned the last sighting was mackerel beach in pittwater
5543266 weve got some folks out there at the moment trying to assess its condition but the fact that it went out to sea yesterday there were whales in the vicinity but its come back in again its pretty sad news
5543267 it would suggest that its not been able to make contact with those whales or they werent interested in it
5543268 its probably a question of days rather than weeks its a very grim prognosis
5543269 if a lactating female with a calf goes past and this calf approaches that animal it may accept it but its a very slim chance

5543285 when we unwrapped the baby to see her she realized it was moving i began screaming and ran with it toward the doctors

5543287 never heard of such a case it was like a medical miracle
5543288 people who only tweet about their own blog posts pretty much suck
5543289 when i was in high school one of my teachers said i am never going to be successful
5543290 thinking about how much i have devoted and what i have gone through before i am here that is the reason for me to be so happy and touched

5543300 i know that according to reports that he wanted to bring media people and cameras and his campaign staffers
5543301 if senator obama isnt comfortable meeting wounded american troops without his entourage perhaps he does not have the experience necessary to serve as commander in chief
5543302 it is safe to say that according to press reports barack obama avoided skipped canceled the visit because of those reasons
5543303 made time to go to the gym but canceled a visit with wounded troops seems the pentagon wouldnt allow him to bring cameras
5543304 we had made absolutely no arrangements to transport the press to the hospital
5543305 why not just say it is never inappropriate to visit men and women in service
5543306 it is entirely likely that someone would have attacked us for having gone and it is entirely likely and it has come about that people have attacked us for not going
5543307 we got notice that gration would be treated as a campaign person and it would therefore be perceived as political because he had endorsed my candidacy but he wasnt on the senate staff
5543308 that triggered then a concern that maybe our visit was going to be perceived as political and the last thing that i want to do is have injured soldiers and the staff at these wonderful institutions having to sort through whether this is political or not or get caught in the crossfire between campaigns
5543309 thats completely untrue and i think honestly they know its untrue
5543310 the meeting leader said i am not telling you how to vote but if the democrats win this bill will pass and you wont have a vote on whether you want a union
5543311 i am not a stupid person they were telling me how to vote
5543312 if anyone representing wal mart gave the impression we were telling associates how to vote they were wrong and acting without approval
5543313 we believe efca is a bad bill and we have been on record as opposing it for some time
5543314 we feel educating our associates about the bill is the right thing to do
5543315 we feel its important that our employee partners fully understand the implications that the employee free choice act could have on their work environment and benefits
5543316 weve always maintained the termination was not related to the union and that there was nothing unlawful about an answer provided an associate about merit pay
5543317 following the decision we were considering offering reinstatement but that is on hold since the union appealed the decision
5543318 this is a david and goliath confrontation but we believe well have enough stones in the sling to knock this out
5543319 there is a system out there or network and that network is going to have to be attacked
5543320 i dont think if you got bin laden tomorrow that the threat has disappeared
5543321 just as sept 11 revolutionized our resolve to defeat our enemies so has it brought into focus the opportunities we now have to secure and expand our freedom
5543322 he has the personality of a fighter pilot when somebody stings you you want to strike out
5543323 just like the american people his reaction was show me somebody to hit
5543324 demonstrated the grave threat posed by a hostile regime possessing weapons of mass destruction and with reported ties to terrorists
5543325 his regime posed a threat we had to take seriously
5543326 to prevent outlaw states like iran today from developing weapons of mass destruction
5543327 to quote sherman war is all hell and we need to fight it out and get it over with and that is when the killing stops
5543328 the imperative that american power never retreat in response to an inferior adversarys provocation
5543329 americans elect their leaders to make these kinds of judgments
5543330 i wouldnt call it a eureka moment but there was a sense that this is where we are headed and this is what we are trying to articulate and they have already done a lot of the work
5543331 and quite frankly from a crass political point of view we were in the making friends business the weekly standard represented a part of the primary electorate that we could get
5543332 it was much easier when saddam hussein was occupying kuwait and threatening saudi arabia
5543333 wed have to convince the american people that its worth again the sacrifice of american lives because that would also be part of the price
5543334 there are not enough secret service agents in the world to keep me away from washington and new york at a time like this
5543335 these networks are well embedded in some of these countries
5543336 were going to have to prove to them that we are very serious and the price that they will pay will not only be for punishment but also deterrence
5543337 some of this anthrax may and i emphasize may have come from iraq
5543338 credible reports of involvement between iraqi administration officials iraqi officials and the terrorists
5543339 accomplishing by example what we would otherwise have to pursue through force of arms
5543340 does anyone really believe that the worlds will to contain saddam wont eventually collapse as utterly as it did in the 1990s
5543341 mccain was hell bent for leather saddam hussein is a bad guy we have got to teach him lets send a message to the other people in the middle east
5543342 they argued that this increase in regulation should be on the next presidents record
5543343 the administration didnt want to show a high dollar value for reducing carbon
5543344 if this administration spent the same effort fighting global warming as they do editing and censoring global warming documents the planet might not be in such dire straits
5543345 the epa has worked diligently to try to get this done
5543346 you dont just wake up one day and say heres the decision its a long process with lots of thought lots of analysis and lots of research that gets you to that decision point
5543347 were going to be more transparent than weve been laying it all out and saying how should we do this
5543348 people were bouncing back and forth into each others offices saying can you believe this
5543349 recalled one agency official who like the others asked not to be identified for fear of retribution
5543350 people thought we are going to move forward and do the right thing
5543351 creates potential for confusion criticism suspicion e g is epa downplaying public health risks and or ignoring the science of climate change in order to avoid doing more
5543352 there was a general feeling that you wanted to limit the findings as much as you could
5543353 an anti regulatory philosophy and concern about what regulation means for the american way of life he would talk for example about not wanting greenhouse gas controls to do away with the large american automobile
5543354 i know some people are going to say were kicking the can down the road
5543355 i cant see fitting the middle school program in what the state baseline is without losing some programing
5543356 i think theres been a number of points of view raised that the cost and the size of the school has to be addressed
5543357 i dont think we could be more specific then weve been already and i suspect if we engage in further discussion we will be more specific
5543358 and as goes recruiting so goes membership sales so we are very focused i will tell you the theme of our international convention at oklahoma city was very much recruit recruit recruit and dont get it out of order
5543359 the american way of life is not sustainble because it refuses to acknowledge that there is a world outside of america
5543360 mr president you are not leading this nation youre just managing the government
5543361 some of your cabinet members dont seem loyal there is not enough discipline among your disciples
5543362 dont talk to us about politics or the mechanics of government but about an understanding of our common good
5543363 mr president were in trouble talk to us about blood and sweat and tears
5543364 i feel so far from government i feel like ordinary people are excluded from political power
5543365 some of us have suffered from recession all our lives
5543366 some people have wasted energy but others havent had anything to waste
5543367 no material shortage can touch the important things like gods love for us or our love for one another
5543368 the big shots are not the only ones who are important remember you cant sell anything on wall street unless someone digs it up somewhere else first
5543369 mr president we are confronted with a moral and a spiritual crisis
5543370 we cant go on consuming 40 percent more energy than we produce when we import oil we are also importing inflation plus unemployment
5543371 weve got to use what we have the middle east has only 5 percent of the worlds energy but the united states has 24 percent
5543372 our neck is stretched over the fence and opec has a knife
5543373 there will be other cartels and other shortages american wisdom and courage right now can set a path to follow in the future
5543374 be bold mr president we may make mistakes but we are ready to experiment
5543375 the real issue is freedom we must deal with the energy problem on a war footing
5543376 when we enter the moral equivalent of war mr president dont issue us bb guns
5543377 weve got to stop crying and start sweating stop talking and start walking stop cursing and start praying the strength we need will not come from the white house but from every house in america
5543378 we can only hope that the little whale has found its mum or has found a female that can look after it and there will be a happy ending
5543379 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered

5543398 i think that one of the consequences of what russia has done frankly is to make all of their neighbors very apprehensive
5543399 those in eastern europe and others who had experience with the soviet union in the bad old days theyve seen some familiar behavior here and they dont like it
5543400 the russians have to keep their promises there is not a single sign that they will begin the withdrawal as they said they would

5543406 japan consumes 14 barrels of oil a year per capita
5543407 if china used the same amount per capita as parsimonious japan chinese consumption would total more than 18 billion barrels a year an amount that dwarfs our countrys 7 5 billion barrels
5543408 add that to new demand for oil stemming from india the newest members of the european community an increasingly prosperous brazil and so on for those trying to discern the long term future of oil prices this is considerable food for thought
5543409 in contemplating china we need to look past carefully crafted images and deepen our understanding of her national interest failure to do so will be perilous

5543422 the woman was some sort of fundamentalist wacko she actually thought that singing would lead to drugs and prostitution you would think that would make her an easy target for first person voted off the tribe but amazingly everyone agreed apologized and stopped singing there was no conflict at all
5543423 dios mio i have a bad feeling about this race
5543424 i figured she was just nervous so i tried encouraging her
5543425 but she just looked me straight in the eye and said competition is the root of all evil and will only tear people apart so i tried explaining to her that that was the point of the game to eliminate people one by one and wind up the winner but she just shook her head disapprovingly and asked would jesus vote off his teammates mr probst would he i have to admit i didnt know quite what to say to that one she was an interesting piece of work i dont think i saw her crack a smile once the entire time she was there
5543426 i wonder if that key is the key to my past
5543427 i was hoping she remembered to start running the race but instead she told me she remembered using a key once to open a door with her dead lover
5543428 the whole thing sounded a little too kinky for me but who am i to judge i encouraged her to start racing but she just kept talking to herself why is he so interested in me running the race she said could he have known my dead lover finally i was able to convince her to go but then she reached the oar and stopped dead in her tracks apparently she felt a connection to that oar i never understood her plus she kept calling herself diana maybe she has multiple personalities in any event i think she needs some serious therapy
5543429 they reached the coconut pile and picked one up so i thought all was well
5543430 tabitha lenox kept tugging at my sleeve and saying over and over that once that coconut was opened all hell would break loose i could not get her to go away at that point i felt like i myself deserved to be declared the ultimate survivor for putting up with those loons
5543431 we gave them two days but no amount of coaxing pleading or even bribery was going to get those women to open those coconuts i can still hear ivys voice in my head as clear as a bell oh you think youre so smug now eve but when i open this coconut at one point eve did give an impromptu lecture on the history of traditional uses of coconuts which seemed to rivet all the other contestants but at that point it took all the self restraint i had not to bash her over the head with one of the blessed things nuts is the word alright
5543432 i felt the most sorry for that poor cameraman rebecca hotchkiss cornered
5543433 she made the poor guy tape endless footage of her saying over and over again i know you rigged those coconuts ivy crane and im going to find out what youre up to
5543434 finally we declared it a draw and gave both teams a crate of sierra mist
5543435 but even then they just stared at it blankly we only drink hot chocolate miguel lopez fitzgerald explained talk about looking your gift horses in the mouth i swear even mitchell or diane could have had these clowns for breakfast
5543436 at that point we decided just to give them all union scale wages and send them home
5543437 no amount of editing could have made those morons even remotely interesting so we started from scratch with the marquesas group sure it was costly but it was worth it
5543438 honestly no i wouldnt bet on them to find their way to their cars in the parking lot but i will tell you who my favorite was grace bennett she sent me a lovely thank you note saying despite what happened she had a wonderful time and wished me the best of luck in the future it came in a package with one of her homemade tomato soup cakes it was completely inedible but it was a nice gesture
5543439 oh you think youre so smug now grace but when i open this envelope
5543440 oh you think youre so smug now meryl streep but when i open this envelope
5543441 oh sure im crossing my legs now but when i go to the bathroom
5543442 2 serie a players listed with brazil ac milan forwards pato and ronaldinho
5543443 3 players from the italian serie a in this semifinal lavezzi pato and ronaldinho
5543444 creates pressure on hamas and is likely to accelerate the negotiations over gilad shalit
5543445 the gesture will not make hamas more flexible about its demands because the organization sees that israel is releasing prisoners with blood on their hands which merely causes hamas to harden its position
5543446 hamas is looking despairingly at how despite the fact that it holds shalit it is not succeeding in bringing about a prisoner release while abu mazen abbas who is conducting negotiations with israel is securing a prisoner release
5543447 its enough to see hamas response to the governments decision to understand the pressure the organization is under
5543448 a prisoner release is not interpreted as a gesture but as weakness
5543449 releasing prisoners as a gesture does not attest to weakness but to strength
5543450 prisoner exchange deals attest to weakness far more than does a move made in a manner and at a time convenient to us with the goal of strengthening moderate elements in the palestinian authority
5543451 david hillis conceived it to mitigate the mega rapidity of the digital world
5543452 i was going for faster faster faster but something in me was rejecting that
5543453 it wasnt clear that the world needed faster faster faster so i began thinking about the opposite working on the fastest machine in the world got me thinking about the slowest
5543454 the electorate i see as being in the following situation goals and programs have been pursued for some time by the party in power and the electorate comes to think thats far enough perhaps even too far its now time to right the balance to include other goals that have been recently at least been neglected or given too low a priority and its tie to cut back on some of the newly instituted programs to reform of curtain them
5543455 by turning away from innovations that increase the speed of production poets could rediscover valuable skills from older methods pace in this slow poetry sense becomes a greater concern value could be placed on the withholding of vital details and the slow release of vivid particulars within rhetorical situations driven by a desire to disclose new knowledge such disclosures of knowledge feeling and perceptions help expand capacities for living in contemporary cultures empowering potential agents for other forms of disruptive acts poetry if concentrated on plausible conjectures of reality can help transform other conjectural definitions of it poetry can prepare readers for disruptive shocks to systems black swan events that increase as global open source warfare increases in sophistication
5543456 systems analysts in other fields are engaged with accurate analyses of global events and their consequences im not sure why poets often turn away from such confrontations with reality certainly our special kind of irrelevance has a value of sorts in its necessary obscurity cultural definitions and expressions of value and so on as artists we need to ask more complicated questions and form practices with greater potential for ourselves if no one else to prepare for confrontations with global disruptions of communications distribution systems and political and social tyrannies
5543457 rather pathetic how about you try and get a life

5543461 on my projects i produce a weekly status report on fridays i stay as late as possible to get it done on friday but if it is not done i finish it on the weekend
5543462 my publish date is monday at 9 00 a m this hard date keeps me focused it also means my sponsor knows she can count on being prepared for her staff meeting at 10 00a m i hold my team responsible for having their reports to me by end of the day on thursday and i am very strict about this since im not pestering them 25 times a week on status questions they deliver their status updates on time and we all can spend the rest of our time on the items that are critical or that can become critical if not resolved this also gives me friday to chase down and solve any issues that need to be addressed prior to finalizing my report
5543463 a purposeful intent or act to do harm to others

5543467 last year when the market was hot everyone thought they could make a pot of gold but this year they see that isnt true
5543468 this shaking out is going to move the industry in the right direction
5543469 we were just trying to ride along there and not make mistakes and now a mistake is made
5543470 at this point we dont even deserve to be in the chase
5543471 every week its something we need to finish in the top spot next week
5543472 last year people were writing me off didnt think id last three games
5543473 to be where i am is quite an honor and im just thankful
5543474 i had to find the right school for me just because my dad played there didnt mean it was the right school for me
5543475 its night and day the difference this time last year to now
5543476 i always had confidence in myself i have lot more confidence than last year i always had confidence in my ability i just wanted to show clemson fans and rest of the country what i can do
5543477 i think cullen harper can be a better quarterback but not as productive statistically because of the offensive line
5543478 opening up with an opponent like alabama grabs your attention right away
5543479 its time for clemson to step up and solidify ourselves as a top team in the country time for acc to step up and play an sec team
5543480 its good exposure for clemson when i signed on the intent was to play in the acc championship game the time is now
5543481 i didnt pay attention to what people were saying good or bad when people said i wouldnt last be the starting qb and i didnt listen to them im not going to worry about this year and all the accolades my dad always reminds me to keep blinders on dont get distracted stay in the now dont look back dont look forward
5543482 how do i get my lover back he she doesnt respond to me at all i tried calling him her several times per day i tried text messaging i have tried everything but nothing seems to work
5543483 the board knows exactly the stance of the players the players have said what they had to say it is up to the board to make the decision i am sure everything is going to be looked at
5543484 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
5543485 very soon youre going to hear that jules used to write with george michael
5543486 and that katie was living on a pig farm when she was younger or that jules used to be in a christian rock band
5543487 none of that is true of course but there are so many things floating around
5543488 its really funny we love it we try to use our imagination to figure out where did this particular thing come from
5543489 people in the uk go in and write anything they want and the press picks up on it
5543490 by far the best pop band the uk has produced in years
5543491 if the song didnt happen within two hours we scrapped it if we didnt have that it factor we knew the song was weak
5543492 are the two main bands that me and katie both adore
5543493 when i was really young i used to steal my parents records because you cant go out and you dont have any money anyway
5543494 they were big fans of elvis that was my first recollection of idolizing someone i was imitating him all the time miming to his records i couldnt get enough
5543495 after that his favorite music was all song based my record collection is so vast everything from nirvana to funk and soul
5543496 when we got to the festival we thought with so many big names in the lineups well whos gonna come to see us and what were we doing on so early
5543497 we were worried that there were only a few people hanging around near the stage but then someone told us to look across the street there were 400 people outside the gate queuing up already that really shocked us to come to the states and have an audience is always a shocker
5543498 n o foram para uma cadeia mas para um centro de contraventores
5543499 a fool and his money should never have been together in the first place
5543500 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5543501 the best games ever that is from someone who has seen a few five ringed stinks and knows the glistening highs and glum lows
5543502 the unfolding asian drama as officially the best games ever
5543503 i have to say i could never imagine it happening under the previous government
5543504 the very expensive security systems of the facility are quite unnecessary for the population who may be detained there
5543505 and yet the plans for the christmas island facility were signed off in june july of that same year and the howard government kept building there was no change to the centre incorporating the palmer recommendations
5543506 as you drive through the first set of heavy electric gates into the vehicle air lock you know that you are in a high security prison with every permutation of steel grills bars and wire mesh
5543507 each of the 400 beds cost the australian taxpayers one million dollars
5543508 do you really think that no one would perceive there is a bridge over there
5543509 when you treat people like idiots theyll behave like idiots
5543510 in the end its always the women who save the world
5543511 well i wouldnt bring that but im not gonna tell you that you cant bring it
5543512 every discussion as an argument and every argument as a battle that must be won at all costs
5543513 a striking occurrence of two or more events at one time apparently by mere chance
5543514 to occupy the same place in space the same point or period in time or the same relative position
5543515 and we are led to those who help us most to grow if we let them and we help them in return
5543516 by bruce weinstein phd relates an incident that happened during the taping of an episode of an a amp e program
5543517 far too often social critics place the blame squarely on our shoulders maligning everything from our work ethic to our spending habits
5543518 my 85 year old mother mary came up with a solution 15 years ago she placed crunched aluminum foil in the sill shiny side up the birds dont like the texture or the shine no nests for the past 15 years cheap fix
5543519 birds around my window air conditionersdrove me crazy last summer and i found lots of poop when i took them out in the fall but i found a solution that sounds much easier than the steel mesh you suggested i got some bird spikes at my local hardware intended to keep pigeons from roosting on window sills it was fairly easy to rig them up and along the sides when i put in the air conditioners this may and theyve worked just fine i wanted metal but ended up with plastic that can easily be taped to the air conditioner or secured other ways probably just slotting one or two underneath would solve the problem
5543520 thats important because people who live in the area get nervous and they start thinking about whats happened in california
5543521 they have good reason theres no reason why it couldnt happen here
5543522 gather up items left downstairs and take them all up in one go
5543523 dual texture is one of the seasons biggest hair trends
5543524 the application of an intense thermal mask designed to enhance elasticity and maintain bust firmness
5543525 for you to call the glamour psychic hotline for a personal and confidential reading with a real psychic for a mere 1 50 a minute from a bt landline
5543526 stay where you are at work i can see double rings in your love life
5543527 the top half is the only part of your body seen in a crowd so make it main priority
5543528 i must get this done tomorrow so that no one else has t do catch up work for me while im gone
5543529 libertarians hate the government and love a good fight they are absolutely the best friends you can have
5543530 tell me a story 8 hubby tried to kill me
5543531 however residents must remember to only water on their two rostered watering days a week either before 9am or after 6pm
5543532 experts agree that watering two days a week is enough to keep lawns and gardens alive and healthy
5543533 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5543534 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5543535 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5543536 i did give documents a long time ago but these matters have been resolved for a long time now as far as im concerned
5543537 ill admit corn based ethanols not perfect but its been blamed for practically every problem under the sun
5543538 were going through a time of change big change and theres going to be some discontinuities theres going to be some upsets
5543539 my disagreement was most of the hearing was testimony supporting ethanol and i dont think theres enough attention being given to the effects that this ethanol production is having on the livestock industry
5543540 they confiscated all of the bibles 315 in total and were told that only one per person was allowed
5543541 according to chinese law each overseas visitor is allowed to bring in no more than three basic units books volumes or box of printed religious materials or visual and audio publications for their own use
5543542 undeclared religious publications would be confiscated ordered to be sent back or held under the supervision of customs
5543543 it came in through all three doors that i have
5543544 a half inch or an inch and were in trouble
5543545 europe will be divided again the lines are different pushed farther east but the division is the same and dangerous
5543546 you cannot conduct foreign policy based on fear of russia weve been through this before ukraine knows it the baltic republics know it
5543547 i dont think russia is an immediate threat to us in the military sense but they are a nasty neighbor
5543548 an alliance with the united states is a long term investment
5543549 poland by deploying the interceptors is exposing itself to a strike 100
5543550 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
5543551 i am not afraid of an invasion and i hate the russians
5543552 that empire is very aggressive but we count on the word of the united states we will be safe because the u s supports us
5543553 only the u s can protect us not europe and so there is no danger for poland
5543554 one battery of patriots will provide no security for warsaw there are lots of threats and not enough privileges
5543555 god created us but he did not will to save us without us
5543556 if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us if we confess our sins he is faithful and just and will forgive our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness
5543557 i hope i can avoid surgery but the way it is right now its pretty bad pretty sore and i cant play
5543558 if its surgery then im out eight weeks and im done for the season but until the doctor tells me im going to hope for the best
5543559 there are a lot of things i want to accomplish you prepare to play a full season and when its cut short thats disappointing
5543560 i pretty much knew that this was going to be the case when i left here thursday night
5543561 it didnt feel good and that was different from my rehab starts
5543562 i could try and get through the rest of the year if we were in a pennant race
5543563 then yeah maybe your approach is different based on conversations ive had with the doctors and how ive pitched the last two times with it clearly im not doing us any good
5543564 the hard part about what i was doing before was that i was just sitting around and getting treatment when theres no guarantee its going to work
5543565 he was everywhere he got the ads he wrote the stories
5543566 i was pretty impressed with his ability to handle deadline pressure
5543567 estamos aqu para trabajar en la reforma estatutaria de nuestro partido ste es un taller de trabajo que ha organizado el licenciado gonz les s nchez con miembros de la comisi n pol tica y la comisi n ejecutiva para presentarnos el anteproyecto con las modificaciones que ser n debidamente estudiadas

5543569 what a poorly cut trailer ill prob wait for the
5543570 the transition from mac to mobileme was rockier than we had hoped
5543571 while we are making a lot of improvements the mobileme service is still not up to our standards we are extending subscriptions 60 days free of charge to express appreciation for our members patience as we continue to improve the service
5543572 it is sad that frank was not able to comply with all of the building and safety and planning regulations that would have allowed him to continue doing business in the city of los angeles but he was given citations over and over again and it got to the point where the city attorney was involved doughboys on third did not have the code required parking the parking spaces they did have were taken up by an inoperable van and storage they used an adjacent duplex owners garage for illegal storage they did not apply for a change of use for the expanded portion of their business from retail to restaurant because that would have meant they needed more parking therefore more than half of their seats were illegal they did not have their own bathroom there are plenty of restaurants along third street el carmen little door etc who attempt to comply with regulations and they are on good terms with the adjacent neighbors businesses that expand or change use illegally make it more difficult for the other businesses to succeed
5543573 niat kalau ramadhan ini yang terakhir buat bapak biar ibadahnya bisa lebih baik
5543574 andai saja kita tahu ramadhan kali ini adalah yang terakhir bagi kita tentu kita tidak akan menyia nyiakannya kalau kita menyikapi ramadhan dengan sambutan yang biasa saja mungkin kita menganggap ramadhan berikutnya akan kita temui kembali padahal itu belum tentu terjadi
5543575 ya anggapan ramadhan terakhir adalah jawaban atas optimalisasi ibadah di dalam bulan mulia itu
5543576 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5543577 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5543578 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5543579 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5543580 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5543581 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5543582 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5543583 who are open to doing something on the production side
5543584 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5543585 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5543586 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5543587 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5543588 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5543589 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5543590 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5543591 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5543592 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5543593 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5543594 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5543595 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5543596 by all criteria of modern molecular biology life is present from the moment of conception
5543597 it is scientifically correct to say that an individual human life begins at conception
5543598 i have learned from my earliest medical education that human life begins at the time of conception
5543599 to accept the fact that after fertilization has taken place a new human has come into being is no longer a matter of taste or opinion it is plain experimental evidence
5543600 navigation 1 read episode 1 but let me tell you it was nostalgic a wonderful feeling and the time flew by just as fast as if i was watching a normal episode i could picture it all in my head and i still felt the chills of something amazing
5543601 i have no idea why people are saying this is an outstanding show but ill rate this as 7 10 at best sure theres a nice setting of venezuela to set the mood and there are some heart warming parts here and there with a slight kiddish touch to it to reinforce the slow paced show but in comparison to fruit basket this is just a mediocre show with a small budget for 13 episodes the plot isnt well developed to give the audience well at least for me the tear spewing experience i had from watching fruit basket nor did it gave an everlasting heart warming experience that makes me hesitate to even consider deleting this show to free a few gig of space on my hard drive i seriously recommend only watching this show so you can get the prelude for aria the natural season2 and hopefully season2 gives this show justice of what it could of been which i havent downloaded yet d similar show fruit basket all the heart warming tear spewing in short whatever aria offers you will get from this show insert a long wall of unnecessary text here lol congrats for reading this wall of txt hopefully its not done in vain
5543602 the united states will have to depend on foreign rockets and spacecraft to send americans to orbit
5543603 as president ill make our space program a priority again by devoting the attention and resources needed to not only inspire the world with feats of exploration but also improve life here on earth
5543604 sometimes it is difficult to know what a politician will actually do once in office because they say different things at different times to different people
5543605 this is a particular problem when a candidate has a short thin record on the issues as in the case of senator obama let me say just in case senator obama does decide to return to his original plan of cutting nasa funding i oppose such cuts
5543606 i will ensure that space exploration remains a top priority and that the u s continues to lead the world in this field
5543607 we can send you for free a list of every home you are looking for the day that home hits the market you will literally get the list of homes the day they hit the market you will never miss another good deal or your dream home best of all its free
5543608 who the hell are you people and why cant you leave me alone
5543609 hows come my little timmy caint read none too good
5543610 monadelphous has moved into the new financial year with a strong forward workload and positive growth prospects for all divisions of the company
5543611 however capacity constraints will continue to provide the most significant challenge for the company and the broader industry
5543612 the risk of project deferrals and delays due to those constraints will continue to provide uncertainty as to the timing of construction revenues
5543613 a case could be made for an early reduction in the cash rate
5543614 indeed less restrictive conditions could soon be called for otherwise the risk of a deeper and more persistent slowing in the economy would increase
5543615 some people are talking about a 50 basis point cut this would put a bit of a dampener on that which is a positive for the aussie dollar
5543616 it doesnt have the degree of urgency which would suggest that the reserve bank sees itself about to embark on a 50 basis point move or a huge reduction in interest rates by the end of the year
5543617 that in turn is pretty supportive for the australian dollar in the short term
5543618 these initiatives will increase 3s 3g network presence from covering 56 per cent of the population today to covering 96 per cent and are in addition to 3s existing infill site program
5543619 i dont expect the polls to turn around in the short term
5543620 they are sending a message at the end of the day youve got to get on and govern for the people of this state and do what is right for them
5543621 its a one way ticket to an ofarrell victory at the 2011 election
5543622 the only winner from alp unrest is mr ofarrell and his team
5543623 we will be trying to head that off at this point in time
5543624 our managers will stay online and police will come to the outer perimeter of the jails and deal with anything that it has to protect the community like escorts
5543625 weve come up with a process of letting them prisoners out and exercising every day showers and they will get all their medical care and be fed of course
5543626 well provide them with a kerb and guttering industrial plot six together in one precinct
5543627 by sharing services the savings are amazing one power station instead of six little ones
5543628 thisll be an example to the world for industrial parks for efficiencies and standards
5543629 we believe were the most sustainable place on earth to make steel
5543630 it just doesnt seem to be fair that this is how we react but that is what we seem to be doing
5543631 if we are serious about reducing global greenhouse emissions the nuclear option is one we cannot ignore
5543632 its a black and white answer or should i say a black green and yellow answer
5543633 clean coal renewables and yellowcake we must include nuclear in our future baseload clean energy mix
5543634 what were seeing yet again is opposition frontbenchers resurrecting the nuclear argument resurrecting their plan for 25 nuclear reactors in australia
5543635 something they didnt tell the australian people prior to the election something they flagged in government and then walked away from when they saw the australian people are opposed to nuclear power
5543636 are they really saying that they have a plan for 25 nuclear reactors in australia where are they going to put them
5543637 they should come clean with the australian people about their plans for nuclear power
5543638 australia has an abundance of renewable energy sources we have a lot of solar we have a lot of wind we have geothermal resources
5543639 we have a lot of work to do as a nation that will enable us to tap those
5543640 we dont believe its appropriate for australia to go down the nuclear path
5543641 whilst its not ideal that we go away with a limited preparation its a fantastic opportunity for this group to begin our super 14 2009 preparations
5543642 one of the beauties of this tour is we can take players out of their comfort zone in terms of the travel in terms of the short schedule between games so guys will really have to be vigilant with their preparation
5543643 you dont get any easy games in france so theyll provide us with a different style of opposition to the irish
5543644 were hopeful that well give a good account of ourselves in all four matches
5543645 the russian side is gravely violating the conditions provided for by the peace accord signed by the presidents of georgia france and the russian federation
5543646 we will do whatever is necessary and no one should have any illusion
5543647 it came in through all three doors that i have
5543648 we are pretty much finished with installation right now we have all kinds of offensive and defensive stuff that we probably wont use during the season i thought we got a lot of work this afternoon in team situations we are starting to develop a two deep and starting to work on our first opponent
5543649 i got into a hitters count 2 0 count and just guessed and got one to hit
5543650 it was pretty lucky he was working us pretty good tonight
5543651 probably the biggest struggle ive had all season with my stuff
5543652 my fastball command was not there i walked a lot of guys five might have been the toughest outing of the season for me as far as laboring
5543653 for 44 years i have safeguarded the country and will continue to do so
5543654 no charge sheet can stand against me not even a single charge can be proven against me as i have full trust in allah almighty and i did everything with the belief of pakistan first
5543655 all stake holders whether they were soldiers politicians bureaucrats members of civil society ulema were consulted in all decisions
5543656 impeachment is their governments right and to face it is my right
5543657 i believe that no charge sheet can stand against me because i never did things for my own self but for my country
5543658 i am not afraid of impeachment because not a single charge can be proved against me
5543659 i am leaving with this satisfaction that i did my best with honesty and responsibility
5543660 we held elections twice the senate national assembly and local government all completed their terms this is the essence of democracy
5543661 i am proud of all these achievements all done for pakistan and its people
5543662 unfortunately all my appeals towards reconciliation and to address the complicated issues fell on deaf ears
5543663 certain vested interests began an atmosphere of confrontation and of vendetta they blamed me of hatching conspiracies from aiwan e sadr
5543664 had it been a conspiracy we would not have done it
5543665 i publicly announced support to the government and offered to share all my experience with them to help address complicated issues it was confronting
5543666 the coalition considered me a problem and not a solution
5543667 are they afraid of me or my obligations under the constitution
5543668 i have fought two wars for pakistan and still have the same spirit for my country
5543669 i took power of the country when it was at the brink of being declared a failed state
5543670 whosoever says that our policies for last nine years were faulty and unsatisfactory should not damage pakistan
5543671 forget about the past and focus on future the government should find solutions for the problems and take the country forward
5543672 both the press and the electronic media should exercise caution in publishing any news regarding the case in question which may have the effect of prejudicing defence of the accused or damaging the reputation of any person connected with the case
5543673 nobody is trying to gag the media they must play a responsible role by investigation the media must not do anything which will prejudice either the prosecution or the accused sometimes the entire focus is lost a person is found guilty even before the trial takes place see what happened in this aarushi case till today what is the evidence against anyone
5543674 there are a lot of questions that remain unanswered about what happens with president musharraf leaving office which still were concerned would keep the authorities totally preoccupied with these political issues and their eye continuing to be off the ball with these pressing fiscal and economic policy issues
5543675 they have some very pressing economic policy issues to start dealing with
5543676 we dont have a sense that there is anything like a consensus within the government on how to get on top of this thats a precarious situation to be in
5543677 well see whether the government in the coming weeks or months puts together a credible package of economic policies and that will tell us whether the rating is ok where it is or not
5543678 i think the pressure on the currency comes from both domestic and international sources
5543679 they have a very large current account payments deficit which they are having a problem financing
5543680 they pakistan have not been borrowing as market conditions obviously in line with our rating have not been favorable
5543681 solves one dimension of the political crisis which has been underway now for many months
5543682 but it doesnt necessarily signal in our view a dramatic change for the better in terms of the broader risks that we think are weighing on the credit rating
5543683 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5543684 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5543685 in adults there has been evidence that less than six hours of sleep a night was associated with high blood pressure levels
5543686 that was one of the more unique findings that poor sleep quality is associated with high blood pressure
5543687 to see how their blood pressure is developing over time
5543688 it does point to the direction that the next studies need to go to understand what less sleep and less efficient sleep mean in terms of blood pressure
5543689 but the changes in the diurnal patterns for adolescents make it harder for them to get up in the morning and to get to sleep at night if we reorganize the day night schedule for adolescents that could make life easier for them and their parents
5543690 we do know that in adults poor sleep and a diminished amount of sleep are associated with obesity and hormone intolerance
5543691 changes occur in the sympathetic nervous system also fragmentary sleep activates inflammatory pathways
5543692 optimizing sleep hygiene following regular sleep habits turning the light off approximately the same time every night keeping the bedroom quieter and avoiding substances that may disturb sleep such as caffeine
5543693 kids as well as adults need to be allowed to sleep enough
5543694 we say eight hours of sleep a night but it takes an hour to wind down its very very hard to allow enough time to sleep
5543695 jon voight your evil spawn angelina jolie and her vacuous hubby brad pitt make about forty million dollars a year in violent psychopathic movies and give away three of it to starving children trying to look as if they give a c p about humanity as they spit out more dunces that will consume more than their fair share and wreck the earth even more
5543696 arent you supposed to be somewhat enlightened or do you not know that the african daughter you hold in every picture had parents who suffered and died because of the republican partys worldwide economic assault on africa over the last few decades since reagan
5543697 a six year old child lived at the premises and he is currently unaccounted for a police spokesman said
5543698 at this stage weve located two bodies inside the premises a 34 year old man and a 29 year old woman
5543699 commodore bainimarama at the pacific island leaders forum in tonga in october last year gave a faithful and unconditional undertaking to have an election in fiji before the end of march next year
5543700 he was compelled as a matter of honour to turn up to the forum and explain himself to the leaders
5543701 it is very disappointing that he wont turn up to effectively take his medicine
5543702 so its very disappointing and i think the leaders in niue including our own prime minister will understandably be very gravely disappointed at the refusal of commodore bainimarama to turn up
5543703 australia needs to argue strongly both regionally in the pacific and in the international community that fiji must return to democracy must return to respecting human rights and the rule of law and democratic processes in fiji
5543704 in my view that is not the best interest of the region especially for fiji and the solomon islands

5543709 australian special forces observed the airstrike which struck the taliban extremist group killing mullah akhtar mohammed
5543710 it occurred in broad daylight making concealment of the patrol difficult it was in an extremely remote area of the province and mullah akhtar mohammed was difficult to pinpoint as he travelled within a very small group
5543711 importantly the sotg special operations task group located him positively identified him and when it was confirmed that there were no non combatant afghans nearby accurately targeted him for the successful isaf international security assistance force airstrike
5543712 in the real world you may need more than one chance at certification this means that if you sign up for the second shot offer and you do not pass a certification exam on your first try you have a free second chance to pass it
5543713 as a coach i look at this roster we have landon donovan and david beckham as a starting point thats fabulous
5543714 i think we have a good group of players to join in and make this a good team
5543715 ive been impressed with the things hes done in this league given all the issues and the demands on his time
5543716 i think hes had a pretty healthy attitude toward the league
5543717 who wouldnt look forward to working with a great player thats one of the great parts of this job
5543718 i have a great opportunity in a great environment and i think we can make things much better than they are right now
5543719 we intend to win championships we know its going to take time and take some patience and hopefully a team that will qualify for international competitions and do well there also
5543720 i told them that the team is not about landon donovan and david beckham its about all of us
5543721 its we its us its not i and its not me
5543722 if we work together as a group we can achieve things
5543723 he has an understanding of our strengths as a team and more importantly our weaknesses
5543724 we stepped out on the training field today and unlike any training session weve had all year we immediately addressed those and we worked on them
5543725 our mentality cant be that we can outscore the other team 5 4 we need all 11 of us to think defense we have to give away nothing so that we can give our special players who are special opportunities to get their chances and win the game for us
5543726 after eight or nine months away from the game i was looking forward to getting back into it
5543727 the sun and the weather year round i dont really like i prefer the east coast where its 100 degrees and humid right now and in the winter i love the snow and the blizzards and all im crazy to be here
5543728 my wife reminded me that it is 24 years this week when i first started working with bruce back at uva university of virginia
5543729 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5543730 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5543731 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5543732 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5543733 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5543734 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

5543737 i thought i looked so good it really struck a nerve i started eating
5543738 it held me back from doing many things i missed out on going away to school partying traveling
5543739 i realize im worth more than what i was doing to myself
5543740 it became a burden a bad dirty habit that needed to be broken
5543741 partners are often beside themselves when their wife stops eating

5543749 as que pienso que sus historias de la l nea de fuego y las cosas que han visto y en las que han estado involucradas y su perspectiva sobre la guerra es muy importante es algo muy importante que conozcan los dem cratas porque el congreso dem crata fue elegido hace dos a os para que acabara con la guerra y fracas completamente

5543765 we have a lot of work to do as a nation that will enable us to tap those
5543766 we dont believe its appropriate for australia to go down the nuclear path
5543767 we will be trying to head that off at this point in time
5543768 our managers will stay online and police will come to the outer perimeter of the jails and deal with anything that it has to protect the community like escorts
5543769 do we stink should we take more showers is it our breath are we giving off bad karma
5543770 youll love the vanilla in the pump it saves you from having to cut and scrape the beans out of the vanilla beans
5543771 i heard you speaking english and am wondering if you know where the cereal is
5543772 youd better be careful you probably have 300 worth of groceries in that cart
5543773 your playing with the big boys now and i dont want you guys to embarrass yourselves being the smallest boat here
5543774 george i thought you were going to get a cake for sally
5543775 um you have to accept the culture for what it is
5543776 youll be living in a double wide tuff shed for the next 12 months so get used to sleeping in your sock drawer
5543777 teaching can be challenging at times but the kids are pretty good
5543778 youll learn to numb your mind to the absurdity and monotony of teaching and the kids well they can either be really sweet or instantly morph into drooling demoniacs just be careful which color of marker you write with because that will determine whether they love you or hate you
5543779 i was pleased with the fact that we were able to get everyone some quality minutes and gave a lot of players a chance to show what they can do
5543780 we still have three days of practice to prepare for our opener and continue to improve
5543781 your mother ran out on us because she thought we were losers you dont want to prove her right do you
5543782 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5543783 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5543784 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5543785 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5543786 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5543787 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5543788 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5543789 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5543790 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5543791 sticker put on the top of it efron was spotted carrying an autographed picutre with him
5543792 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5543793 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5543794 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5543795 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5543796 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5543797 only because she had failed to consider a backup venue option for one of the project challenges
5543798 in afghanistan whether it is forced or not forced it is a crime because the islamic rules say that it is
5543799 i think it is good there are many diseases that can be created in todays world such as hiv through illegal sexual relations
5543800 ive been a doctor for 35 years and this is the first time ive ever seen such a thing happen this is somewhat of a medical miracle
5543801 weve informed the health ministry and i guess theyll appoint a commission of inquiry the hospital will ask for an external investigation of the case
5543802 because of just how premature she is her chances are very slim then again she already saw divine intervention once so you never know were doing everything we can for her
5543803 i earned 67 000 in my first month of internet marketing
5543804 to celebrate the first of what im sure will be
5543805 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5543806 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5543807 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5543808 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5543809 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5543810 google has a clear business interest in expanding access to the web
5543811 see it as a long term investment part of real estate for them is owning a piece of new york
5543812 the flatiron is expensive but with the cheap dollar it made sense to increase our share
5543813 the stability of the new york real estate market is unique this current crisis will pass and the dollar will re establish itself we are confident
5543814 this isnt just about the dollar the strongest driver is that investors are looking for geographical diversification the same situation played out on wall street about 10 to 15 years ago
5543815 european companies are very much conscious of the potential windfall you buy cheap now with the belief that in 10 years the currency will have rebounded
5543816 in terms of infrastructure the u s is an emerging market
5543817 the difference between the u s and europe is that the u s has stellar science and a rapid rate of innovation and transferring that technology to the market for commercial purposes
5543818 they could save 8 000 a car by building in the u s
5543819 the market has changed it will be a much bigger market for the kind of small car with advanced technology that the europeans are so good at making
5543820 its not just that american assets are cheaper the untold story here is that foreign investors are no longer willing to finance american debt
5543821 if you were to look at america inc as a company its like owning a company and you own a smaller and smaller fraction of it so the fraction of america inc owned by americans is diminishing
5543822 because the focus right now is the weakness of the american economy and anything to keep our economy going is welcome
5543823 of course it was before i was born but i remember him talking about it

5543911 students these days are in general nice i choose the word carefully they are not particularly moral or noble neither war nor tyranny nor want has hardened them or made demands on them the wounds and rivalries caused by class distinction have disappeared along with any strong sense of class as it once existed in universities in america and as it still does poisonously in england students are free of most constraints and their families make sacrifices for them without asking much in the way of obedience or respect religion and national origin have almost no noticeable effect on their social life or their career prospects although few really believe in the system they do not have a burning sentiment that injustice is being done to them the drugs and sex once thought to be forbidden are available in quantities required for sensible use students these days are pleasant friendly and if not great souled at least not particularly mean spirited their primary preoccupation is themselves understood in the narrowest sense

5543919 but its pretty obvious to me after being here that hes one of the better pitchers in this league
5543920 thats part of my job driving in runs and youve got to have guys on base to do that
5543921 its a testament to those guys im just trying to be a complement to the puzzle
5543922 probably the biggest struggle ive had all season with my stuff
5543923 my fastball command was not there i walked a lot of guys it might have been the toughest outing of the season for me as far as laboring i had to work hard to get through five and get a couple more
5543924 weve been coming back all year long and so were expecting one of those games
5543925 youre not going to win them all but obviously thats one of the better teams in the american league east and the american league for that matter theyve got a great bullpen and lester gave them a great start tonight
5543926 it is difficult to still play a lot of matches
5543927 we had a tough series in houston and to come in here and win three of four was pretty good
5543928 we put them in some bad spots especially our first team and they were able to hold them
5543929 if the defense can keep doing that once we get our offense together well be fine
5543930 its really just that the defense wanted to prove a point and say hey you know that wasnt us that first week
5543931 i think sometimes its amazing that what you work on and emphasize and what you push is going to be what youre the best at
5543932 were all being evaluated right now from the 15 year vets down to the rookies
5543933 we have to get better each practice and each preseason game so we can reach our goal of being an elite team
5543934 we know what he can do we certainly want him here and im anxious to have him come in
5543935 but in the meantime i know quite a bit more about our backfield
5543936 i feel good about the quarterback rotation right now and i dont want to mix it up on the short week
5543937 we seem to be making progress with our entire offense so i want to keep that going its extremely important to me
5543938 he certainly has given me no reason to take him out right now
5543939 were staying consistent with our plan i do feel confident weve got three quarterbacks who can win games two of them i know can because ive played with them in the past and ill continue to take a look at j t too

5543941 were still making too many fundamental type mistakes that cant occur when were game planning weve put a lot on these guys during fall camp from an installation standpoint on both sides of the ball and once we get to narrow that down hopefully we can focus more on our fundamentals and technique
5543942 during the goal line situation we were able to put the ball in from the six on two plays each time and i was real pleased with that
5543943 obviously we need to strengthen our run defense there in goal line and we know that will get done weve got a lot of defensive linemen out right now

5543955 we remain suspended for the moment in afghanistan out of respect for the victims of this horrible crime
5543956 the change is that we suspended operations and we are looking at all of our processes
5543957 were looking at if and how we can continue working there to safeguard our international and national staff
5543958 we are surely committed to the afghan people as were jacqui nicole shirley and mohammad the four individuals that were killed
5543959 the young canadian women that were killed they were there to assist afghan kids go to school there are more young afghan kids in school including girls than ever before as result of this kind of humanitarian assistance
5543960 over the years weve worked there weve had various levels of insecurity to deal with and weve adjusted our operations accordingly
5543961 the area in which we work has been one of the safer areas although we have seen an increase in insecurity
5543962 in most environments where we work there are markings on our vehicles in afghanistan we dont use them anymore for obvious reasons
5543963 but what we do in situations like that or even as a result of what happened more recently we reassess our operations and security
5543964 but we are committed to stay on the ground and continue the work that we are doing but to ensure that we do it in as safe as possible means
5543965 were not going to respond to threats and certainly it will have no effect on canadian policy
5543966 but at the same time its a good kick in the behind for me its been about a month and a half since ive raced and over two months since ive raced internationally so its good to get out there again and feel that kind of pressure
5543967 we knew hed be fast maybe being next to cal threw him off a bit
5543968 i had dittmer in every heat ive had all summer thats the name of that game ive also had pretty much the hardest heat at every world cup so im all right with that
5543969 my name is rather small and relatively new in the game so i dont feel any pressure like that
5543970 the only pressure i feel is from myself i set very high standards for myself like everyone here does and if i dont race my best ill be disappointed if i race my best and do the same thing ill be ok
5543971 we live very much in a media society and i am talking about all media the way the media portrays mental illnesses is far from accurate and far from positive it tends to sensationalize all the bad things in a way that it doesnt with any other illness nelson said
5543972 so we need a strong public awareness and education campaign across canada to ensure people right from school age are educated about what mental illnesses are and what they are not
5543973 finally something seems to be happening because for those of us working in mental health it gets really disheartening year after year after year when nothing seems to be done you ask and you ask and you ask and nothing seems to be done hopfauf said
5543974 the funding commitment underscores the government of canadas belief in this important initiative to improve the quality of life of canadians and their families dealing with mental illness clement said in a news release
5543975 i thought of the songs that i would listen to growing up of the memories attached to some of the old stuff that my parents were playing and of the feelings attached to those memories

5543983 i think alberta is losing momentum faster than b c because it has been gaining momentum faster than b c
5543984 the higher you go up the faster you go down
5543985 theres no major cause for concern though because it will be just a cyclical story as opposed to a structural story
5543986 the housing market has been a very important source of strength but that market is starting to weaken which will be enough to weaken the consumer a little bit
5543987 if household credit were to continue to rise by 13 per cent a year at some point i would become concerned because you would have too much credit and not enough wealth to support it
5543988 you dont want a gap between the growth in credit and the growth in the economy with credit growing and the economy slowing
5543989 with the recent correction in the stock market and a slowing housing market canadians are seeing their net wealth position shrinking
5543990 its a completely unnecessary addition to the shopping basket to purchase bottled water
5543991 i think people ought to wake up consumers are pretty gullible
5543992 we do not believe the restrictions will effectively encourage increased consumption of tap water or decrease plastic beverage container litter on city owned property
5543993 years ago the water fountain was all over the place and we didnt have bottled water
5543994 i think our society gets caught up in convenience too much eventually youve got to begin to put on the brakes and ask people to think

5544021 id have to say that monckton won the debate he came across as more prepared and had answers at his fingertips whereas richard appeared to verbally stumble on occasion

5544063 americans need to get over the political bigotry that there are only two parties
5544064 must be astonishing to canadians who have a multiparty system
5544065 mainstream political parties can essentially cooperate in failing to even attempt to solve problems faced by a majority of citizens usually because they have been funded and supported in other ways by large corporations
5544066 naders presidential campaign as with other similar past campaigns by independents and third parties serve the purpose of educating people about the huge gaps in the mainstream parties platforms
5544067 not stupid theyve developed a highly proficient way of censoring themselves
5544068 until these loopholes are closed you will continue to see regular dishonest unethical secretive unrepresentative and wasteful actions by governments and corporations
5544069 hello americans cut the crap stop making excuses and take over
5544070 protest the corporate control over our political system and to call for opening the presidential debates
5544071 hmmm we realize that someone cannot mention everything in one column so that these are selected things that professor clayson has learned i am sorry that he has chosen to publish such negative stuff since there is a lot more to learn
5544072 i would just like to mention that calling those holding an opposing view stupid is nothing new
5544073 mccain is still considered the republican candidate for president while edwards is not
5544074 i have heard over and over again about mccains affair what channel are you watching i think it is one of the only things the democrats have that and showing pics over and over of mccain with bush as if because he took a pic with him he is just like him
5544075 jeroze doyou read anything other than left wing talking points
5544076 the polls are tied yet i cant find anything reporting that bit of info here or on the national sites why
5544077 what does it matter if mccain had an affair its common knowledge that obama had an affair as well
5544078 today prof clayson denounces the press for its religious reverence to obama he then tries to prove it by providing three examples
5544079 the bat thinkaboutit and mister t have apparently been living on the moon for a while and have been out of touch with events here on earth the fact that john mccain was fooling around with cindy while he was still married to carol is something that he admits
5544080 jeroze you are right on mccains affair i did not see the entire saddle back event i was watching the swimming
5544081 cross you kill me every week i cant help but think you read a different article than me each week because your generalizations of claysons intent and meaning behind is writing seams to be much different than what i read
5544082 i dont get it the title says it all now liberals everywhere are trying to say clayson did not learn these things
5544083 cire asks what does it matter if mccain had an affair
5544084 cross is your goal to be insulting to people because if it is you are surely reaching your goals
5544085 sorry cire i wont take you seriously anymore and please dont take what i just wrote seriously

5544090 the institutional culture of corruption embraced by the clinton leadership of the democratic party
5544091 unaccountable power for the clintons at the expense of the rule of law and respect for the constitutional processes of government
5544092 especially since it was days after she said she wouldnt take any more money from me
5544093 sen obama needs someone experienced in foreign policy and or running a state or corporation joe biden would be good
5544094 she has the perfect place for a republican platform the washingtonpost com
5544095 free us from our addiction to oil from 4 00 plus per gallon gas
5544096 there is no time to waste we want a better future we demand a better future we the american people are no longer asking
5544097 the free us ad takes a different tone than our previous efforts
5544098 this ad issues a direct and compelling challenge and juxtaposes the stark imagery of our addiction to fossil fuels with the earnest faces of the american people who are calling for answers and solutions now it takes the call for renewable energy from a request to a demand
5544099 the conventions are about coming together to choose the ideas and the people who will lead us forward
5544100 the next american president has the inescapable responsibility to move our country away from fossil fuels and toward clean sustainable energy sources our economic and environmental futures depend on it and the american people are demanding it

5544110 i do not see why man should not be just as cruel as nature
5544111 i totally dont see him that way but thats what actings for when we get on the stage
5544112 you want me to bring home what i got at the office today ill put you through that window
5544113 my father beat the hell out of me and all it did was make me fantasize about the day i could murder him
5544114 these last couple weeks i spent more time with you than i ever spent with him
5544115 must have been hard on you that doctor dying huh
5544116 i have to ask you if hes the reason why we fought so much while i was away
5544117 he wanted to tell you but he couldnt so im telling you for him if he had to die im happy he died in love
5544118 we got close too close but it was over before you got back
5544119 you and i both know that the worst thing in the field is a soldier worried about problems back home
5544120 over a million patients are injured in u s hospitals each year and approximately 280 000 die annually as a result of these injuries therefore the iatrogenic death rate dwarfs the annual automobile accident mortality rate of 45 000 and accounts for more deaths than all other accidents combined
5544121 300 000 americans die each year in hospitals as a result of medical negligence
5544122 i have been performing liver transplants for 22 years and this is only the second time i have heard of something like this
5544123 radio serves you meatloaf and you know theres steak back in the kitchen
5544124 no end in sight because some in washington are still saying no to drilling in america no to independence from foreign oil
5544125 who can you thank for rising prices at the pump
5544126 ive been telling people the truth whether i thought thats what they wanted or not
5544127 i went to the people of new hampshire to tell them the truth sometimes i told them what they wanted to know sometimes i told them what they didnt want to know
5544128 the best way to lower childrens fluoride intake as health canada suggests is to stop fluoridation
5544129 it makes no sense to prescribe fluoride drugs to children via the water supply at levels which are between 150 and 250 times higher than the level in mothers milk
5544130 these meetings will give the public information they dont get from our government or dental organizations
5544131 in the afternoon a panel will address the question of whether toronto should stop fluoridating its water in the evening experts will explain fluorides dangers to health
5544132 the best way that the oda can get communities and politicians to stand up for water fluoridation is to provide in person a cogent and scientifically referenced defense of fluoridation at the afternoon forum
5544133 the weight of evidence does not support a link between fluoride and intelligence quotient deficit
5544134 there is no question there is a lot more excitement in our state for sen obama than there is for sen mccain r ariz
5544135 sen obama is seen as a huge breath of fresh air
5544136 well be focusing on the continuation of the last eight years and more of the same
5544137 it may give more choice in the primary election but less choice in the general election and thats where we elect our leaders were not sure what the disease is but the cure is obviously worse than the disease
5544138 but i see that r james woolsey a former director of the c i a serves on the board of american congress for truth your educational foundation
5544139 if you are worried about death threats why would you put a glamorous photograph of yourself on the cover of your new book
5544140 he was obviously uncomfortable and we were uncomfortable you cant just develop policy on the spot so not knowing who this person was i had no idea what his standards were and i think we certainly had the discretion to ask him to leave
5544141 im an independent reporter who does original research and has a record of being credentialed
5544142 i dont think theres any question im a member of the media
5544143 sign whatever it is the favored members of the media have to sign swear to whatever they have to swear to
5544144 who would have thought last year that me and t boone pickens would be in the same boat pulling the same oar the same way
5544145 when you go to the gas pump you dont check whether you are a democrat or republican
5544146 now dependent on foreign nations for 70 percent of its oil the u s is exporting 700 billion annually more than four times the cost of the iraq war
5544147 there are people standing by with billions ready to invest in the future sun wind geothermal biomass
5544148 we cant drill our way of this situation but we will do everything we can to produce more domestic energy just two years ago i pushed for 8 3 million acres of drill sites in the gulf of mexico now that is done
5544149 any credible domestic energy policy must reduce our dependence on foreign oil by at least 30 percent in the next 10 years
5544150 he understands the issues and is interested and excited by the work we are doing to educate and involve the people
5544151 importing 70 percent of our oil now thats an issue of security its going to take us 10 years to reduce our dependency by 30 percent
5544152 were sorry but the head you are calling has been disconnected
5544153 obamas granny has selected the vp she will announce this afternoon at 5 00 pm eastern time
5544154 if they would only let her into the debates and stand on the same stage with all the leaders people would be able to compare and see that for themselves
5544155 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
5544156 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
5544157 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
5544158 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
5544159 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
5544160 efforts to build and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
5544161 to go from a small town like taunton and go to america and do all the research he does especially this as part of the nobel peace prize is a great achievement
5544162 to ensure our national security economic prosperity and clean environment by breaking our dependence on foreign oil
5544163 the hands that install roofs can also install solar panels the hands that build todays cars can also build the next generation of fuel efficient vehicles barack obama will create 5 million jobs developing homegrown energy technologies
5544164 one of the most important ways of positioning on global warming is to emphasize the jobs issue since it appeals to people who you might not otherwise reach with your message
5544165 the call to sacrifice for the nations greater good remains an imperative of citizenship sadly in recent years in the midst of a war on two fronts this call to service never came after 9 11 we were asked to shop
5544166 plenty of recent media polls demonstrate that drilling for more american oil particularly offshore drilling has the potential to be a very effective wedge issue for republicans as a way to reduce the price of gas
5544167 for the immediate short term right now forcing house democrats to vote on drilling offshore and in wilderness areas or exposing their refusal to hold this vote would be a potentially strong wedge issue that would split the democrats win among independents and excite the republicans
5544168 the republican echo chamber has done a great job on this
5544169 this intolerable dependence on foreign oil threatens our economic independence and the very future of our nation
5544170 the energy crisis is real it is worldwide it is a clear and present danger to our nation these are the facts and we must face them
5544171 thou shalt not talk honestly to the american people about sacrifice
5544172 the democrats talk of tolerance but in reality the only tolerance they ever exhibit is for their own intellectual arrogance and they dont have tolerance for my culture
5544173 they think were a bunch of hillbilly heathens who go out and burn crosses and do crazy bullshit
5544174 they dont give a f if were with them or not because it doesnt matter the f ing republicans have stolen the individual liberties thing and thats why the gun thing is such a big deal
5544175 i got a call from them right after johnny got out i never heard back
5544176 they have to be careful sometimes they remind me of another bunch from chicago the blues brothers they seem to think theyre on a mission from god
5544177 if thats how he runs his campaign he is going to lose id rather bet on those who voted before when he stands up and says that im gonna get 30 per cent more black voters im gonna get 30 per cent more of my people to turn out for me what is joe six pack thinking
5544178 he should say im a black guy im not gonna take the michael jackson treatment but the problems of south side chicago are the same problems of the appalachian mountains big sonsofabitches are kicking the little sonsofabitches in the ass now im one of the little sonsofabitches so im pissed off inside every rural republican is a rural democrat begging to get out but we always trip over our johnsons
5544179 think this election will be won on the internet but here at 5 30 in the afternoon they dont go on the goddamn internet they go watch the andy griffith show a 1960s sitcom
5544180 white people in the south and throughout the appalachians love black culture i mean southern style cooking is black food everything i eat is fried your swing vote in the appalachians comes down to common sense thinking people who have strong faith and what barack obama needs to do is embrace his culture because we like his culture but nobody knows anything about him over 10 per cent of the rednecks out here and im a redneck think hes a muslim cause nobodys ever told em any different
5544181 im pretty sure i aint a queer and ive never had queer thoughts
5544182 but god loves them queers every bit that he loves the republicans
5544183 its their mouth they can use it to haul coal if they want to
5544184 the gallant kids from around here who lost their lives
5544185 it is the same exact people its the same f ing bunch of fight sing drink pray people who are over there who are over here in these mountains
5544186 youre damn right theyre on hadrians side of the wall is where they are and they want the scots irish vote well its true its f ing genes its who we are as a people well say f you to bush longshanks or maggie thatcher f any of em
5544187 bitterly clinging to their religion guns and antithapy towards others
5544188 im here to advocate for sen obama that we get a democrat into the wh
5544189 thats an all time high for optical scan usage in this nation
5544190 electronic system usage will go down in 2008 for the first time since we started collecting data in 1980
5544191 we studied these systems and all the systems in use in ohio and the most vulnerable to risk are the touch screen voting machines
5544192 there have been no votes lost just votes that are missed and hours later or days later recovered
5544193 we are in fact in compliance with the terms of the contracts
5544194 if theres a machine failure or a power outage or some kind of misprogramming with the machines it will enable people to keep voting
5544195 what has happened since florida 2000 is weve taken a problem that was a disaster for that election and made it exponentially worse
5544196 these machines cannot be trusted for the counting and recording of our votes
5544197 computer scientists around the country have demonstrated that in less than 60 seconds one of these machines can be broken into and can infect the entire system on which people are voting
5544198 touch screen voting machines have proven to be accurate reliable and secure time and time again
5544199 it is important to note that successful elections necessitate people processes and the technology all working together
5544200 anytime there has been a change in voting equipment there have been some some doubts and concerns which lessen over time due to familiarity with the new equipment
5544201 if all you have is the electronic memory you can reprint that electronic memory as many times as you want its going to say exactly the same thing and you wont know whether its right
5544202 more than a third of the voters in this country will be voting in an unverifiable way
5544203 without an audit without the ability to audit it will be unreliable and without paper record you cant really audit
5544204 this is the central act of democracy it is the basis for the all the legitimacy of our government and its actions we believe or at least want to believe that people are put in office by the will of the voters thats what you need to be able to verify
5544205 making up your mind questions to consider before the next election
5544206 heres what i want you to do between now and election
5544207 dont just look at issues look at character issues are important but you also have to look at character
5544208 theyre saying im totally self sufficient in myself and nobodys self sufficient enough to be president its too big a job
5544209 rick warren is at the forefront of a kind of younger generation of evangelical protestant leaders who want to have a christian public presence in the culture but who are less tied to the republican politics of their predecessors
5544210 theyre values oriented guys but less convinced that either their own principles or the best politics lies in a total commitment to the republican party
5544211 we are one of those people that make over 250 000 a year and i dont agree that that makes us rich
5544212 even with that kind of income we struggle to pay everything we have gotten ourselves into
5544213 im pretty much a dyed in the wool republican and i was a marine what he went through for five years you gotta hand that to him
5544214 i mean come on whoever buys into that they gotta have a screw loose
5544215 just stay in the senate stay busy learn more foreign policy and come back in ten years obama and i betcha id vote for you
5544216 hes as genuine as can be its just hes a green apple hanging on the tree and mccain is a ripe red apple ready to be picked obama just needs to ripen some more
5544217 barack obama is going to get the same percentage of the religious vote that john kerry and al gore got
5544218 thats christian identity politics and im sure it has some influence but i dont think at the end of the day its the deciding factor
5544219 jimmy carter could have come in here and sounded much more comfortable with his faith but people having seen a jimmy carter presidency would not vote for him just because theyre likely to see him in heaven
5544220 study all the different candidates at every different level you need to register to vote and then you need to vote
5544221 when i hear people say i dont like either of the candidates im just not going to vote i want to say to them well then you need to move to another country because people died for that vote
5544222 if this helps anyone out there who is in their middle aged years and has put off what they wanted to do because they thought they were too old or because they have a child and that they cant balance what they want to do with being a parent then thats great what ive done is show them that they can do it
5544223 it was thought that if youre getting to 16 17 or 18 youre getting to the end of your career dara has done a fantastic job in proving that you can continue to improve and that women can have children and get back into the sport she has gotten rid of a mythology in swimming that has been there for so long
5544224 at least i didnt let my dogs eat them this time
5544225 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5544226 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5544227 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5544228 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5544229 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5544230 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5544231 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5544232 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5544233 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5544234 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5544235 if were allowed to join the army and defend our country at the age of 18 then we should have the right to drink
5544236 plaintiffs will lose out on a fair amount of exposure and the opportunity to express their views in a popular forum
5544237 forcing saddleback to include another candidate at the last moment could cause serious logistical problems and take away from the presentations of other candidate this might well disrupt the planned presentation
5544238 eight weeks ago obama probably felt like he didnt need her eight weeks later he probably needs her more than hes willing to admit and certainly more than she needs him
5544239 brandi you are presently under investigation for your part in the murder of two fbi agents
5544240 if you are connected to this crime in any way the fbi will find out about it if there is any physical evidence connecting you to this crime the fbi will find it and youll be prosecuted this is a federal murder case its a safe bet the u s attorney general will seek the death penalty for anyone involved now listen very carefully to what im about to say this is the one time i cannot help you should you feel the need to share the details of your involvement in this with me ill report anything i learn to the fbi do you understand what im saying
5544241 more than likely its a federal indictment and juries just love to hang cops
5544242 im on the hook for two dead fbi agents kidnapping a u s marshal shooting her sisters boyfriend in front of her no less
5544243 so exactly what kind of deal are you offering me i get to pick out which arm the needle goes in theres nothing youve got that i want
5544244 a difficult night was that what you think i had thats what you call getting drugged getting kidnapped getting this close to being raped a difficult night jesus remind me never to go clubbing with you
5544245 nothing either one of you does makes me feel superior
5544246 i dont have a substance abuse problem ive actually had the same job for more than a month not a single eviction repossession or restraining order to my name nor have i ever had gas electric water or phone service turned off for non payment and as far as i know ive never slept with someone elses husband can anyone else in this room make any one of those claims how bout a show of hands nobody what a surprise oh my god all your screwups have given me such a swelled head thank you for making me feel so superior but youve given enough so from now on im going to return the favor and let you clean up your own messes thats my gift to you maybe youd like me better if i helped you less
5544247 kom laten we hier achter liggen dan zien ze ons niet meer
5544248 joo die jongens van hiernaast hebben een duizendklapper in de gang haha
5544249 wooow het staat in de fik henrike het staat in de fik
5544250 waar is de brandblusser hoezo doen ze hier niet aan brandblussers
5544251 ooohh het brandalarm gaat leo wat denk jij zullen we eruit gaan het is vast weer zon stomme grap
5544252 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5544253 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5544254 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5544255 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5544256 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5544257 john mccain is going to own the george bush economy around his neck in this election he was central to its architecture he was one of its fiercest defenders in america florida has lost more jobs over the last year than any other state in the country
5544258 it doesnt take much if our supporters are turning out at a rate of 74 percent 75 percent 78 percent and mccains are turning out at 68 70 72 that doesnt seem like a big deal but it is the whole ball game
5544259 bush had an advantage over kerry because of their intensity we think mccain is going to have trouble replicating bush in 2004
5544260 we dont take florida for granted but we do have a good history here even though were outnumbered in this state our voter turnout effort has been extremely good in florida
5544261 florida once again is the epicenter of the political universe were very confident that florida continues to trend as republican going back to jeb bush mel martinez charlie crist of course the president bush elections weve got a good mature organization on the ground
5544262 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
5544263 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
5544264 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
5544265 if you wanted to attack the u s bring us to our knees you wouldnt even have to come here
5544266 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
5544267 we send it to a few friends and we send it to the people who dont like us very well
5544268 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war
5544269 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
5544270 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy

5544277 if it wasnt for erica i wouldnt know just how evil i am
5544278 meeting erica was a party by itself theres nothing like a meeting of the minds sometimes you feel more at home with someone youve never seen before than with people who have been in the background for years

5544345 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
5544346 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
5544347 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5544348 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5544349 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5544350 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5544351 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5544352 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5544353 many in the christian right tend to get their information
5544354 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
5544355 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
5544356 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
5544357 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous

5544361 when she expressed a desire to help people in rural maharashtra we decided to encourage her
5544362 she always had an inclination toward social service and we decided to cultivate it
5544363 the drive began in july and by the end of the month a total of 2600 was collected this money was sufficient to dig a bore well as well as fit an electric pump
5544364 i want to build rural maharashtra i want medical attention to be available to everyone and make physicians available in every village in rural maharashtra

5544371 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
5544372 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect

5544377 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
5544378 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
5544379 the problem of maximizing power from sunlight has been known for at least 30 years and is primarily one of physical limitations not engineering technology
5544380 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
5544381 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
5544382 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
5544383 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
5544384 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
5544385 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
5544386 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
5544387 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
5544388 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
5544389 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
5544390 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
5544391 karena itu salah satu buku yang menginspirasi saya untuk selalu optimis sama apapun
5544392 i will be supporting the removal of abortion from the crimes act i think thats the right thing its the right thing in terms of public policy mr brumby said
5544393 but i would stress that the proposal we are putting to the parliament is one that would be consistent and fully consistent with current clinical practice
5544394 for women i think its a crucial matter for them that a personal decision theyve made about themselves and their body is subject to action under the criminal code
5544395 removing this from the criminal code is important for women it is something that many women and many womens organisations have fought long and hard for so i think its important

5544424 the israelis have claimed for years that iranian uranium enrichment efforts are the first steps toward the development of a nuclear weapon a weapon they believe may be used on the jewish state
5544425 i wont accept it because i cant accept it because i dont what else ill do if this fails
5544426 i will fight tooth and nail against anyone who tries to make me accept it because i will be too lost if this doesnt happen
5544427 okay im not going to be president but how about vice president or something so i dont have to face having nothing
5544428 its all real its not a bad dream i am lost and dont feel like doing anything else everybody just leave me alone
5544429 okay i guess i dont have nothing i still have my family i still have people who believed in me i still have a job in the senate i can still make a difference
5544430 my core value and life has been to be of service my daddy did and so have i for most of my adult life i like being an educator on the problems of global warming but i may actually have more leverage to help that and other initiatives as president and besides i will agree if elected to only serve one term where one of my most important roles is to mentor barack obama to be the real president who makes change happen after i leave office in 2012

5544434 gender stereotypes trump race stereotypes in every social science test
5544435 the deal is that women generally fall into two alternatives they are seen as either nice but stupid or smart but mean
5544436 contact doesnt undermine these stereotypes and it might even strengthen them
5544437 many people dont believe seeing women as kind or soft is a stereotype theyre not going to question it because they believe its a good thing
5544438 the measure of a civilization is how it treats those who have hurt it
5544439 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
5544440 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
5544441 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values

5544447 as a comedian as a person as a citizen as a mammal
5544448 being conducted on the scale that bush conducted things or even the clintons i dont think it has the same true viciousness and contempt

5544458 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
5544459 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
5544460 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
5544461 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
5544462 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
5544463 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
5544464 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
5544465 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
5544466 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
5544467 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
5544468 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation

5544471 better black television has been a vision of mine for some years
5544472 ive done a lot to promote and change the way messages are relayed to our children and our families over the last few years promoting positive content and positive messages is so important to educate and preserve the next generation being exposed to positive content is what changed my life i believe that there is a market in our community for a new diverse network that provides a new brand of superior programming that caters to all aspects of television from reality to original programming in addition im excited to be able to expose the urban community to a vast array of jobs in the entertainment community that they might not otherwise be privy to i have a great relationship with bet and mtv and my son and i will continue to do work with them and support their networks with bbtv were spearheading the initiative to meet consumer demand for family friendly hip hop content

5544478 the sooner it starts the better for the hills and the state
5544479 we are taking all initiatives to ensure an early dialogue involving the centre the state government and the agitating gorkha jan mukti morcha the state chief secretary visited new delhi a couple of days ago to persuade the centre for an early talks
5544480 besides it has been systematically hounding out the political adversaries particularly the cpi m activists of the darjeeling hills these are not helping in creating a congenial atmosphere for the impending tripartite dialogue
5544481 this is perhaps the best means left at our disposal at the moment to evolve an enduring solution to the vexed tangle
5544482 the tripartite dialogue should start at the earliest and there is a palpable apprehension in the hills that further delay on the crucial matter may cause the volatile situation to spiral out of control

5544502 i only obeyed royal orders sire but it seems that every few years someone commands that i take just a bit more off that pillar but no one ever stopped and asked or gave a thought as to what that pillar might be holding up

5544510 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5544511 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5544512 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5544513 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5544514 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5544515 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5544516 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5544517 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5544518 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5544519 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5544520 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5544521 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5544522 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt

5544525 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5544526 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5544527 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5544528 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star

5544530 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5544531 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5544532 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5544533 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5544534 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5544535 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5544536 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5544537 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5544538 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5544539 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5544540 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5544541 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border

5544544 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution

5544547 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
5544548 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
5544549 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
5544550 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
5544551 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5544552 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5544553 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
5544554 you dont need to keep dumping on the people because you know the people can only go so far
5544555 being able to make ends meet i think thats whats on everybodys mind trying to make ends meet and its hard to make ends meet because everything keeps going up but the salaries
5544556 people that are in my neighborhood that are my age who continue to work we just sort of grit our teeth but the elderly that are in my neighborhood that dont have a resource its a real concern to them
5544557 theres a bunch of us here just mainly to show our support
5544558 you got an aging infrastructure its got to be improved its got to be maintained
5544559 its still a very inexpensive product that theyre delivering at the cost of less than one half of one cent they deliver safe drinking water to the homes even with the increase its still going to be less than one half of one cent

5544564 our teachers were taught and still are taught to lecture to cover the material
5544565 instead of mutual respect teachers dis the kids saying games contribute to a short attention span that theyre a waste of time thats not true
5544566 our members understand that if barack obama is elected president and he has support in the senate to confirm anti gun supreme court nominees the district of columbia v heller decision could be taken away from us in the future
5544567 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
5544568 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
5544569 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
5544570 she had been told to take this baby and leave him in a soiled utility closet
5544571 in leaving born babies to die without treatment christ hospital was doing nothing illegal under the laws of illinois doctors had no ethical obligation to treat them under the law they were non persons
5544572 there was no legal conflict between omalleys bill and the right to
5544573 there was some suggestion that we might be able to craft something that might meet constitional muster with respect to caring for fetuses or children who were delivered in this fashion unfortunately this bill goes a little bit further and so i just want to suggest not that i think itll make too much difference with respect to how we vote that this is probably not going to survive constitutional scrutiny number one whenever we define a previable fetus as a person that is protected by the equal protection clause or the other elements in the constitution what were really saying is in fact that they are persons that are entitled to the kinds of protections that would be provided to a a child a nine month old child that was delivered to term that determination then essentially if it is accepted by a court would forbid abortions to take place

5544580 they said they couldnt come right then they said theyd come at 10 30 p m we sat outside till 10 30 then they said its be another hour or so
5544581 obviously something went wrong and we are so sorry that one of our members had such a terrible experience
5544582 again we are working with them to make sure this situation doesnt come up again
5544583 a lot of folks are old and dont have any family to take care of them
5544584 ill go forth and choose ill look at the data and ill say yes to this and yes to this and yes to this and ill paint a picture of the things that i want and ill vibrate about them because thats what im giving my attention to and the universe will respond to my vibration and then ill stand in a new place where a whole new batch of yeses are available and ill say yes to this and yes to this and yes to this
5544585 arent you just thrilled that there are billions of beings of intelligence within you
5544586 think of this random universe where everything is possible the organizational skills belong to
5544587 imagination was given to man to compensate him for what he is not a sense of humor to console him for what he is
5544588 if the world were merely seductive that would be easy if it were merely challenging that would be no problem but i arise in the morning torn between a desire to improve the world and a desire to enjoy the world this makes it hard to plan the day
5544589 everyone thinks samantha is lindsays prototypal gay love but we were rattling aroused until her emotion of existence institute discover crowd us apart
5544590 at the instance she was terrified her occupation would be over if she revealed her sexed tendencies but then samantha came on to the environs and i was dropped
5544591 i hit never been happier in my life we are over the moon
5544592 i was not expecting to be meaningful on my ceremony day but then ive ever finished things a lowercase controversial
5544593 fat bitches like this shouldnt wear purple but lots of makeup
5544594 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5544595 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5544596 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5544597 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5544598 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5544599 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5544600 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5544601 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5544602 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5544603 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5544604 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5544605 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5544606 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5544607 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5544608 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5544609 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5544610 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5544611 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5544612 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5544613 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5544614 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5544615 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5544616 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5544617 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5544618 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5544619 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5544620 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5544621 meses e meses de sites elaborando players legais mas ningu m nunca tinha pensado numa fita cassete brilhante
5544622 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5544623 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5544624 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5544625 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5544626 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5544627 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5544628 there were folks being sentenced on a one to five to a maximum that exceeded five years
5544629 they were given one to 10 when the statute said one to five
5544630 this is a terribly vague number and is a dangerously recorded number that is not representing what is actually happening
5544631 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5544632 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5544633 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5544634 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5544635 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5544636 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5544637 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5544638 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5544639 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5544640 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5544641 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5544642 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5544643 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5544644 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice

5544648 traditionally people have tied their software to their hardware virtualization changes all that
5544649 you need that like you need a hole in your head
5544650 theres no doubt that when it comes to our treatment of native americans as well as other persons of color in this country weve got some very sad and difficult things to account for
5544651 i personally would want to see our tragic history or the tragic elements of our history acknowledged
5544652 i consistently believe that when it comes to whether its native americans or african american issues or reparations the most important thing for the u s government to do is not just offer words but offer deeds
5544653 the biggest problem that we have in terms of race relations i think is dealing with the legacy of past discrimination which has resulted in extreme disparities in terms of poverty in terms of wealth and in terms of income our inner cities are a legacy of what happened in the past and the question is less assigning blame or rooting out active racism because thats not the reason that those inner cities are in such bad shape but rather figuring out are we willing to make the investments to deal with that past history so we can move forward to a brighter future and that involves investing in early childhood education fixing the schools in those communities being willing to work in terms of job retraining and those are serious investments
5544654 is serious investments code for reparations and how expensive and devastating would obamas income redistribution policy be
5544655 fundamental injustice cruelty brutality and inhumanity of slavery and jim crow
5544656 does barack obama believe its time for america to apologize to al qaida
5544657 the push has begun among obamas fellow liberals for reparations to osama bin ladens al qaida warriors
5544658 in wonderfully liberal style that is beyond parody rutten uses a book review to endorse the idea of paying money to osamas fighters who in the eyes of liberals have been denied their right of habeas corpus at guantanamo
5544659 the liberals on the court with the mind boggling addition of reagan appointee anthony kennedy held that contrary to bush administration and congressional policy not to mention all of american history the prisoners of war or detainees picked up off the battlefields in this case afghanistan and iraq are in fact entitled to the same constitutional rights as american citizens
5544660 lobbying not simply for habeas corpus rights for al qaida but reparations as well
5544661 in other words if you have been captured on the field of battle fighting the u s military on behalf of the global jihad and as a result are now on an extended stay at gitmo liberals feel the appropriate policy of the united states government is to 1 apologize for capturing you and 2 pay you some cold american cash to ease your pain and humiliation
5544662 we still gave them a day in court and that taught the entire world about who we are but also the basic principles of rule of law
5544663 if americas only problem was with a sum total of about 1 800 german soldiers why all that disturbing fuss known as world war ii
5544664 stashed in 511 internment camps sprinkled all around the good old usa from north carolina to iowa to california
5544665 not a single one of these men were given their habeas corpus rights they were not tried not one they were held as prisoners forced to do whatever labor their american captors thought suitable until america had won the war
5544666 will obama have the courage to follow the arguments to their logical conclusions if the idea is to have american taxpayers fork over damages to osamas men why not hitlers where are the trial lawyers who have been flocking to guantanamo the size of the damage pot in a suit against the u s government for the treatment of nazis would one suspects be considerable

5544669 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
5544670 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
5544671 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
5544672 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
5544673 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
5544674 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
5544675 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
5544676 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
5544677 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
5544678 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
5544679 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
5544680 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
5544681 and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved

5544683 do you believe that jesus christ is the only way
5544684 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

5544758 it an alleged threat and it is not true the government of sudan is a serious government and it is totally committed to its obligations especially when it comes to agreement signed with other organizations and especially the united nations and the african union im not aware of any threat that has been towards to the united nations regarding their very existence in the sudan if the icc has and the judges have confirmed the indictment of the president
5544759 i would rather say that the government is totally committed to its obligations and we have never threatened the united nations peacekeeping force here in sudan whether in darfur or in the south
5544760 in fact they usually do that not only in sudan but everywhere just in case because it happens that when the icc announced its indictment of the president of sudan some of the un peacekeepers here have been relocated outside of the sudan in case anything might happen and this proves just a precautionary measure and because nothing happened and things are going normal in sudan and now those are taken away from sudan the peacekeepers have been flown back to sudan

5544781 president bush appreciates president musharrafs efforts in the democratic transition of pakistan as well as his commitment to fighting al qaida and extremist groups
5544782 president bush looks forward to working with the government of pakistan on the economic political and security challenges that they face
5544783 the decision by president musharraf will now open up the possibility for the new government to act more decisively on issues facing it and i think that will allow the united states to work in closer cooperation in the weeks ahead
5544784 the fight against these kinds of groups that are interested in attacking the united states or our allies or friends around the world is a fight that was much larger than musharraf as an individual and required institutional changes within the pakistani army intelligence and also at the civilian level among the civilian political leaders to address the rising tide of extremism throughout the country
5544785 with musharraf out of the way it actually provides an opportunity now for the united states to distance itself to some extent so that if the military and the civilian government can agree on a policy which i think inevitably is going to have to be a more aggressive approach to the extremists it will not be seen as american policy

5544794 it is premature to talk of the incorporation of the moa ad into the governments constitutional practice or municipal meaning domestic law
5544795 hence our chief negotiator mohagher iqbal is duty bound to accept the completed negotiation of the ad strands as a done deal
5544796 is about a new formula on political settlement of the bangsamoro problem not some legal battles about treaty making or judicial litigation
5544797 that tro temporary restraining order in the supreme court turns upside down the tor terms of reference of the agreed text on ancestral domain which are meant to allay fears and apprehensions
5544798 sovereignty territorial integrity and the constitution of the republic of the philippines
5544799 milf we are no better negotiators but truth is on our side
5544800 government negotiators are high caliber men who know how to negotiate but it just happened we in the milf are standing on solid historic moral grounds that are impossible to defeat in a fair and square deal
5544801 has no unkind words to government negotiators although he acknowledged that discussions sometimes got so passionate and emotional which he described as natural in negotiations
5544802 the whole debacle tro on the moa ad brings to the fore the issue that executive secretary ermita raised on several occasions when he asked whom shall the grp negotiate with in the face of the factionalism within the moro liberation movement but this time it is the milf that should ask the same question with whom shall the milf negotiate the arroyo regime congress supreme court the church the big business power blocs the afp or pi ol and the filipino colons colonials in mindanao
5544803 after more than three months of due diligence three months that it took the legal experts commissioned by the grp to study the constitutionality and legality of the draft moa ad now the grp negotiating panel chair is telling us that the same issue which took four years to settle on the negotiating table has to be renegotiated
5544804 if one has to listen to the griping against the moa ad and give validity to the claims of those filipino sectors that say that they are stakeholders in mindanao but were not consulted it is as if it is the bangsamoro people who have no right to assert their own claim to their ancestral domain the filipinos have forgotten that the moro homeland has been occupied and owned by the moros since time immemorial and for which they have sacrificed many lives down the centuries to preserve and defend from aliens including the filipino colons who covet it
5544805 having been forced to cancel the act of affixing its signature on a document that it had already initialed earlier the grp is cast in a situation whereby its capability to conclude peace agreements with the milf not to mention the mnlf and the national democratic front ndf is now open to doubt and this does not augur well for the peace process in mindanao because elements within the moro liberation movement who oppose negotiations with the grp seem to have been proven right indeed why negotiate with a weak and inutile government that cannot exercise authority over its own perople let alone deliver on its commitments in the agreements it signed with other parties
5544806 this can of worms has also regurgitated another unsavory reality that has been with us ever since our forefathers fought the spaniards and their indio factotums servants the anti moro attitude of the filipinos we are aghast at the way filipino politicians whether in and out of government and with the help of the media have whipped up an anti moro anti muslim hysteria that has swept the whole country it is simply nauseating to see and hear on radio and tv these politicians blatantly and publicly distort the moa ad and turn it into propaganda to demonize the milf the bangsamoro people and islam it is sickening to note that they are playing on the ignorance of the filipino public to drum up opposition to an agreement that would be the key to resolving a long drawn conflict that has confined both the bangsamoro and filipino peoples in the political economic and social quagmire
5544807 clearly the filipino politicians and their paid media hacks who peddle this lie either do not know the root cause of the mindanao conflict or they are simply driven by their greed and colonialist impulses not to allow any measure of justice to be accorded to the moros whatever it is the simple but ugly truth that now stares us in the face is the filipinos hate the moros so much that they would never allow the latter to be free or even be given a semblance of self rule
5544808 the filipinos have no right whatsoever to accuse us of failing to consult our public they should remember that the bangsamoro people were not consulted when they were incorporated into the philippine commonwealth in 1935 and subsequently into the philippine republic in 1946 it has always been the rule under the philippine colonial regime that when it comes to the partition of moro lands only the filipinos have the right to do that not the moros
5544809 now under the milf the moros want to recover whatever little is left of their ancestral domain and be given the chance to govern themselves as a sub state entity within the larger philippine nation state peace on the basis of justice is about to be achieved under this formula but even this does not sit well with the filipino elite the politicians the church and the filipino colons in mindanao they have sabotaged the efforts of their own government all including those who claimed to be sympathetic to the plight of the bangsamoro people like senator aquilino nene pimentel jr have ganged up against the bangsamoro people to prevent them from even reclaiming areas which they now actually occupy and where they are the majority the result back to square one mindanao again is on the edge of an all out war
5544810 what needs to stated here for the record is that we moros are not inclined to abandon our homeland to these vultures we will fight for it as our ancestors fought for it the mestizo leftovers of the spaniards such as the likes of teddy locsin and lobregat and filipino colons in mindanao like pi ol as well as their capitalist patrons ensconced in makati can go hang themselves from the nearest lam post for all we care the moros will fight milf base commander ustadz amirul ombra cato will not be alone a war in mindanao will drag down this pathetic artificial country and its government to perdition perhaps this time we will no longer settle for a sub state or a federative arrangement with the filipinos its useless anyway because they would never grant it they would always insist this is secession even if we do not have the intention to secede so lets give them a dose of their own medicine lets aim for independence this time for real like what the algerians did when their clamor for autonomous rule was repeatedly and violently denied by the french colons given the filipinos hostile attitude to anything moro and muslim there is no other option left this is now the reality facing us
5544811 they grp should do the final signing of the moa ad one word is enough for a wise man wheres justice it is they who did not keep their word
5544812 if we do not negotiate my friends there will be a return to bloodshed and more people will die
5544813 it wasnt to enable others to get a free fare or cause any sort of havoc
5544814 it was really to show how major the issues are in this system which also might resonate in many other systems around the world

5544846 the large number of children coming into contact with the legal system mostly as a result of abuse cases has motivated intense scientific effort to understand childrens true and false reports
5544847 the seriousness of abuse charges and the frequency with which childrens testimony provides central prosecutorial evidence makes childrens eyewitness memory abilities important considerations arguably even more important however are adults abilities to evaluate childrens reports
5544848 the findings suggest that adults are better at detecting false reports than they are at detecting false denials
5544849 while accurately detecting false reports protects innocent people from false allegations the failure to detect false denials could mean that adults fail to protect children who falsely deny actual victimization
5544850 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5544851 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5544852 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5544853 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5544854 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5544855 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5544856 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5544857 this is a very subtle difference but it is significant
5544858 persons with emerging als may also have similarly subtle symptoms
5544859 we can only guess why this pattern is less common in the mutants
5544860 such therapies could very well be effective against the non genetic version of the disease as well

5544863 i was always telling my friends that i wanted to do something daring posing for a magazine was what i had in mind but i didnt tell them that but i never got around to it

5544877 for one thing the kernel is quite complex and big and it inevitably simply takes time to learn all the rules not just for the code but for how the whole development environment works similarly for a new developer it will take time before people start recognizing the name and start trusting the developer to do the right things
5544878 we make it fairly easy for people to ease into kernel development
5544879 it seems to be working too we literally have thousands of people with patches attributed to them in each release
5544880 the worst thing anybody can do is to study the kernel alone and try to learn things in private and then however many months later present all the established kernel developers with a big patch that just comes out of the blue
5544881 it may not sound exciting but quite frankly i dont think anybody who starts out believing that they want to rewrite some big piece of the kernel should even bother reality isnt that simple
5544882 of course some people will be alienated and theres no doubt that the process could probably be improved
5544883 not a warm and fuzzy environment where people sing kumbaya around the fireplace
5544884 the kernel is about pretty harsh technical issues and mistakes are really frowned upon
5544885 in an os kernel there are simply more security and stability requirements and the bar is really higher in some respects that will inevitably also reflect in the response to patches
5544886 i think that one of the things weve been very good at is to scale up with a good network of maintainers so that most people involved actually dont work closely with more than a handful of people
5544887 normally the people you find at the core of open source projects are professional software engineers these guys know how to run software projects
5544888 a team has left the game the game was closed
5544889 but you might have some information thats vital and if you didnt speak up the case might be harmed then how would you feel
5544890 this is a very young calf its probably two to three weeks old it absolutely needs its mother or another whale to adopt it
5544891 its heart wrenching normally whales stay very very close to their mothers theyre inseparable and they suckle for 11 months before being weaned
5544892 we managed to coax it out to sea yesterday by towing a yacht
5544893 the sad news is this morning its returned the last sighting was mackerel beach in pittwater
5544894 weve got some folks out there at the moment trying to assess its condition but the fact that it went out to sea yesterday there were whales in the vicinity but its come back in again its pretty sad news
5544895 it would suggest that its not been able to make contact with those whales or they werent interested in it
5544896 its probably a question of days rather than weeks its a very grim prognosis
5544897 if a lactating female with a calf goes past and this calf approaches that animal it may accept it but its a very slim chance
5544898 this is a very young calf its probably two to three weeks old it absolutely needs its mother or another whale to adopt it
5544899 its heart wrenching normally whales stay very very close to their mothers theyre inseparable and they suckle for 11 months before being weaned
5544900 from very early on dr nelson has sided with the spirits industry in opposing this measure
5544901 but from the early evidence that we have from the tax office this measure is being successful
5544902 dr nelson needs to explain what impact his opposition to this measure will have on the health of young people and on the sorts of outcomes that we are trying to achieve for the community in making sure that young people have a healthier approach in the way they consume alcohol
5544903 dr nelson is taking i think a big risk by opposing a measure which could have a significant impact on the health of the next generation
5544904 i hope these examples prove the business benefits that flexible working can bring and that they help inspire other organisations to follow suit
5544905 if it rolled in after august 6 it needs to roll out
5544906 if anyone thinks they can kill our citizens and escape unpunished we will never allow this if anyone tries this again we will come out with a crushing response
5544907 this centurys threats are as least as dangerous as those we have confronted in the past

5544912 it is possible that some unknown environmental factor is the cause of current health problems and of gulf war syndrome
5544913 but it is also possible that these symptoms result from the stress of military deployment especially prolonged and multiple deployments
5544914 women now comprise approximately 15 percent of our nations armed forces
5544915 and since the persian gulf war combat roles for women have expanded substantially this study is an attempt to understand the impact of deployment and war related stressors on the health of military women
5544916 by identifying problems early i hope our findings will guide policy makers and health care professions to design interventions to support service members and their families
5544917 but i think once you get used to is its going to be fine you see crazy things over here in china fans are so energetic over here and they love every athlete so you kind of see that over here more often
5544918 im going to do the handover for the next olympics and hopefully begin to prepare myself for london like i did for bejing
5544919 the person i love the most is sitting in the front row my mom for everything shes done
5544920 that is the one question i have no clue how to answer
5544921 the last 24 hours ive received probably four to five thousand messages on my blackberry
5544922 every time i read a text message i cant stop smiling
5544923 he was saying everyone in america is proud of me and supporting and then he told me to give my mom a hug and tell her the president sent it
5544924 the amount of support from people following the olympics and swimming from back home its a pretty cool feeling
5544925 what he did in basketball is what i want to do in swimming he completely changed the sport i want to meet tiger too and weezy rapper lil wayne but i really really want to meet jordan
5544926 brick walls are there for a reason they let us prove how badly we want things

5544931 having endpoint data leak protection technology alone is not sufficient to provide the maximum coverage for data leaks and reconnex had a unique value proposition with unique architecture complementary to our portfolio
5544932 we are going to grow the reconnex business and work very hard at integrating it not only with our host data leak protection technology but also with our epolicy orchestrator epo
5544933 we have a very successful formula here which we believe is repeatable integrating technologies quickly with epo and providing the maximum value to customers
5544934 one of the core things you do in data leak protection is you define what sensitive data you want to protect
5544935 so you have to define your data twice in completely different ways
5544936 were reading a lot about the candidates and the media this election season but what are they reading
5544937 now you can track the news sites and blogs barack obama and john mccain read from drudge to the daily show and follow articles catching the eyes of leading political journalists
5544938 the companys business profile has been significantly undermined by the dramatic deterioration of the automotive industry in north america where aggregate demand has dropped sharply given the well documented economic concerns in the united states
5544939 on the contrary and true to unpredictable form rather than squandering the opportunity orange nubuck on orange suede with a slightly off colour midsole and laces a pleasantly black lining plus embroidered details on the heel and art on the insole makes for a good look provided orange is your thing and for us it is

5544942 i just spoke to alexander aland sommelier and director of restaurant for searings restaurant at the ritz carlton dallas and he is now confirmed
5544943 one of the sommeliers from the bellagio is going to be there
5544944 ive heard shes really good it would be cool to meet her
5544945 a girl came to me and said she wanted to be an exotic entertainer and she didnt know what to do and she asked me to teach her well i had never done any erotic dancing so i didnt really know what to teach her she offered me 500 for one hour i had some friends in lexington kentucky who had connections to an adult club there so i went there just to see what it was all about
5544946 assuage loneliness or in an attempt to reach out and form social connections with others
5544947 it is important for social scientists to continue to examine this phenomenon to fully understand its affects on psychological processes that differentiate it from other similar forms of self expression
5544948 it is appalling to me that people still want to invoke my fathers name five years after his death to ascribe beliefs ideals values and loyalties to him that cannot possibly be determined and to try to further their own agendas by doing so
5544949 i knew my father pretty well at least better than some of those who entitle themselves to his legacy and his supposed ideals and even i would not presume to say publicly what i know he thought or felt this is especially dangerous in the case of political affiliation it is unfair and presumptuous to use him to bolster any platform i would ask that my father not be co opted in this election for either side since he is clearly not here to defend or state his own allegiance
5544950 it might not be a great fit but its better than being closed for four days
5544951 in the first phase we will focus on the raw material side get the coal linkages to produce pellets and sell them in the market said jsw cfo seshagiri rao
5544952 with inflation at 13 per cent i expect interest rates to go up 1 1 5 percentage points more
5544953 it will hurt us marginally if we are exposed on the variable interest rates and cannot pass on the interest rates increases in non regulated part of the businesses said gvk cfo isaac george
5544954 given these rates it doesnt make sense to borrow and grow the business so we are selling 5 per cent equity to private investors said tuli
5544955 with interest rates at 14 75 per cent we are going slow on our expansion and trying to generate the funds from alternate sources like shareholders or private investors
5544956 told from a variety of perspectives each story builds on the last drawing the reader deeper into the passion and misery that wind their way through the estate beautiful and genuinely frightening
5544957 readers will be eager to know how next this house and its ghosts wreak havoc and even death on those unlucky enough to darken its doorstep
5544958 what we want to do is empower drivers so instead of them paying dead money by way of lease fees to government coffers theyll instead be able to build an asset for themselves equity in their own small business
5544959 what is absolutely critical is that we actually get more people into the industry that are acutally driving taxis
5544960 the less restrictive conditions could be soon be called for
5544961 a case could be made for an early reduction in the cash rate
5544962 new icaan proposal could hurt small business organizations trademarks will not be automatically reserved
5544963 my home state just doesnt seem to know how to party
5544964 ive been embarrassed by the lack of support for the sesquicentennial
5544965 and i want to celebrate the place i grew up in minnesotans have passion about their state you can see im a vikings fan by the number of super bowl rings im wearing
5544966 i wanted to celebrate minnesotas history its spirit its troubles and its promise
5544967 i think its all in there the spirit and the spit its been like pulling teeth to get this far but here we go
5544968 im just a minnesota boy who loves minnesota and wants to wave its flag
5544969 even at two hours you cant tell the whole story
5544970 but my songs come from a minnesota throat and i think we have captured the state pretty good

5544972 theres a large number of adults out there who seek out children as sexual objects
5544973 if i actually save one childs life then this is all worth it
5544974 see this guy starts the conversation off with asking for age gender and location
5544975 a lot of people think that with child pornography the child is not an actual victim
5544976 but every time that child is shown the child is victimized again
5544977 i can get in touch with other icac agencies and pass the information along to them
5544978 the arrest may be a guy from another state its still important because its protecting the child that he thinks hes talking to your child
5544979 when you do a computer exam it will take you to the websites this guy has been to that will give you a lot of information about the case
5544980 you can go into the computer and find out where they have went to those websites and youll even know what date and time
5544981 most of the crime that we see out there is going through the hard drive of a computer
5544982 we have drug dealers that are keeping up with the drug shipments and what theyre selling and who theyre selling to on a computer and when theyre not selling dope theyre stealing identities
5544983 put it in the family room monitor what they do monitor what sites they go to
5544984 let me ask you is there a term besides mexican that you prefer something less offensive

5544995 i can give you a definite no on that in one word no in two words hell no
5544996 it clearly promotes homosexuality and its message is shameful and disgusting
5544997 i think we might play songs from van halen one
5544998 i think it was touching for them to have an element of nasa and space at their celebration
5544999 it could have been puzzling for them being that we were there to celebrate 400 years of quebec city and we show up with
5545000 it was really great because i feel im an actress and all the stadium was just for me
5545001 liu would not have withdrawn unless the pain was intolerable

5545007 oh well i just ordered the board for 299 99 and when i get it i get to keep my old board it turns out the step up offer was an error and your step up will be cancelled so you can just place your order like i did
5545008 no fair i want to pay 309 99 and send my old board back in instead
5545009 apple apple hi girl you hungry yeah you want an apple there you go girl here you go
5545010 shes very sweet very loving but she has an identity crisis she thinks shes a dog
5545011 thought i was going to break up a cat fight went outside pushed some branches away and said hi to mr bear
5545012 the bear climbed up on the fence and then pretty soon apple and the bear were nose to nose having fun
5545013 we think she might have just been getting a little territorial and the bear hopped down and she chased him out of the pasture
5545014 it hasnt gone to her head yet that shes a star but who knows she could be demanding more apples you know more bushels
5545015 is it ethical for health care professionals to support the administration of drugs that are of unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed
5545016 we specifically take issue with the minister using that phrase
5545017 the minister was off base in calling into question the ethics of physicians involved in harm reduction
5545018 its clear that this was being used as a political issue
5545019 flying into a black hole with a bag over your head
5545020 ive never noticed the droplets off the top of the waves before
5545021 and to think that they actually pay us to do this
5545022 a truck to drive back and forth to puerto lempira
5545023 look you guys need that airplane i want you to have it it needs to be used doing the kind of work that you all are doing im going to give it to you now and you pay me when you can
5545024 i have 2 500 for you toward a vehicle can you use it
5545025 we are buying a vehicle but its an airplane instead of a truck can we use the money for that
5545026 mr jack there is smoke coming out of your motor
5545027 lord if i am not going to make this take off safely please let me know before i get to the end of the runway
5545028 you dont really need brakes to fly this airplane has been without brakes for the last two months
5545029 no problems well except for the time i ran into the fence at the end of the runway in cauquira i got a little bit of barbed wire wrapped around the propeller but it was no big deal
5545030 julio if i ever find myself with this problem again what should i use if i dont have any hydraulic fluid
5545031 but if you drink two cold beers and then get into the airplane you wont worry about the brakes
5545032 theyd go door to door theyd just pull on the door handle to see if it was locked then theyd go to another vehicle
5545033 anything that puts a negative slant on our community and our ability to sell is obviously something of concern
5545034 it clearly is a concern however having said that we have clearly clearly not had any affects
5545035 i think developers and investors recognize that there are some parts of all our american cities that have difficulties but were also getting some favorable publicity along with some not so favorable publicity
5545036 people that are in the business of choosing locations choosing what cities to invest in look at a wide range of parameters and make their decision based on an overall picture

5545040 it is difficult to see how banks will continue to repeat the heady profit growth of the past few years if they borrow at these levels
5545041 if banks keep borrowing at these levels you will get a repricing of credit for the whole economy
5545042 it is difficult to see how banks will continue to repeat the heady profit growth of the past few years if they borrow at these levels

5545048 he is on his way to ho chi minh city
5545049 he doesnt want to go back to the uk because hes had so many troubles there already

5545053 ill be honest i didnt know a lot about him before i got here
5545054 but its pretty obvious to me after being here that hes one of the better pitchers in this league
5545055 thats part of my job driving in runs and youve got to have guys on base to do that
5545056 its a testament to those guys im just trying to be a complement to the puzzle
5545057 probably the biggest struggle ive had all season with my stuff
5545058 my fastball command was not there i walked a lot of guys it might have been the toughest outing of the season for me as far as labouring i had to work hard to get through five and get a couple more
5545059 weve been coming back all year long and so were expecting one of those games
5545060 youre not going to win them all but obviously thats one of the better teams in the american league east and the american league for that matter theyve got a great bullpen and lester gave them a great start tonight

5545101 i spare you the twists and turns of my cogitations for no conclusion was found on the road to headingly and i ask you to suppose that i soon found out my mistake about the turning and retraced my steps to fernham

5545105 frenzy is a perfect fit with the conservation values and spirit of the south coast and is a fantastic acknowledgement of the regions wildlife
5545106 since we have a large budget for ppc its very important that we keep tight control of it otherwise we can very quickly lose large amounts of money what reports would you run daily to accomplish this why weekly monthly and so on
5545107 squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent senator obama
5545108 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5545109 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home

5545116 if we are serious about reducing global greenhouse emissions the nuclear option is one we cannot ignore
5545117 its a black and white answer or should i say a black green and yellow answer
5545118 clean coal renewables and yellowcake we must include nuclear in our future baseload clean energy mix
5545119 what were seeing yet again is opposition frontbenchers resurrecting the nuclear argument resurrecting their plan for 25 nuclear reactors in australia
5545120 something they didnt tell the australian people prior to the election something they flagged in government and then walked away from when they saw the australian people are opposed to nuclear power
5545121 are they really saying that they have a plan for 25 nuclear reactors in australia where are they going to put them
5545122 they should come clean with the australian people about their plans for nuclear power
5545123 australia has an abundance of renewable energy sources we have a lot of solar we have a lot of wind we have geothermal resources
5545124 we have a lot of work to do as a nation that will enable us to tap those
5545125 we dont believe its appropriate for australia to go down the nuclear path

5545167 as it runs out of body reserves it may beach itself or simply slip away from us in shallow water
5545168 as that happens it does become a little bit susceptible to predators
5545169 the evidence over the past 12 to 18 months suggests that we have underestimated how fast this aspect of the earths system can change
5545170 from our perspective this government is clearly pursuing some wrong priorities so weve taken the decision to oppose measures that we frankly dont believe are in the national interest
5545171 we are concerned it has the potential to compound the problem of alcohol abuse in young and not so young australians
5545172 dr nelson needs to explain what impact his opposition to this measure will have on the health of young people and the sorts of outcomes we are trying to achieve for the community in making sure that young people have a healthier approach to the way they consume alcohol
5545173 if the liberal party are about to put their hands up to maintain a tax exemption or a special tax treatment for this category of alcoholic drinks which is specifically targeted at young girls the question i want to know is what do they believe the binge drinking rate will become on young girls in the future once they take this action
5545174 to maintain a tax exemption or a special tax treatment for this category of alcoholic drinks which is specifically targeted at young girls
5545175 no you cant interfere with us militarily because we have nukes
5545176 now we control the worlds key oil producer and any muslim who wants to do their haj must come to us

5545183 these were sensitive reports and we unfortunately did not treat them with the higher degree of care that they deserved
5545184 this is particularly difficult for us because we have always tried to provide our special needs and family advocacy members with an enhanced level of support and consideration
5545185 it does not relieve us of our responsibility to do everything possible to protect our families and reduce any anxiety we have caused
5545186 its a function of several things the aging of the traditional population the birthrate of the newer population the immigrant population but also the growth of the hispanic culture not just in the desert southwest but across the united states
5545187 all of these social forces are coming to a head and were going to see by 2050 a dramatic shift in the rest of the country
5545188 but for those of us in southern california its happened look at the san fernando valley what theyre projecting for the rest of the country has already transpired in los angeles
5545189 if we think that politicians are starting to pay attention to latinos and latino communities now you aint seen nothing yet
5545190 virtually across the board were going to see increasing demands for more equitable distribution of power and power arrangements in and beyond california
5545191 on the one hand it has developed a kind of tolerance that is a majority way of thinking
5545192 if we want to make sure that we have a high quality work force that meets the needs of an increasingly globalized economy
5545193 we need to address the needs of our public schools so that the young people have the skills they need to replace the baby boomers
5545194 we need to begin planning to meet the needs of a growing population as well as in many cases begin to maintain the systems that we built many years ago that havent been properly maintained over time
5545195 is that the census and their projections is nothing more than recognizing the reality of whats happening across the country and that reality already exists here in los angeles

5545216 a vessel of 2 2 m draft was recently escorted into the lake although progress was halted when the vessel became stuck and required a tow the same vessel however left the lake unassisted
5545217 obviously its best for deeper draft yachts to come through at the top of the tide but we would not expect any yachts up to 2 m draft to have any problems especially once the work on the channel is completed
5545218 we are happy to accompany any yachts who think they may have a problem through the channel and if necessary use our boats wash to help them over any bumps or even provide a tow if absolutely necessary however we dont believe towing would be required
5545219 if boats log in with us and let us know they are coming up for the hcw race we will certainly look after them
5545220 as they approach the entrance to the channel we can advise on conditions and also take care of booking bridge openings for them
5545221 in addition any deeper draft boats can advise us of their drafts and we can accompany them through the channel if required
5545222 however if evolution were true if our brain and sensory organs are simply accidents of nature and if nature itself is merely an accident of a big bang then there would be no reason to trust that our senses and memory are reliable or that there should be any order in the universe to study

5545247 a color monitor to control the radio climate control and optional nav system
5545248 is a vast improvement over the first generation g35 and now features such novelties as aluminum trim modeled after japanese washi paper

5545250 body motions were better controlled than the sport pack bmw 335i
5545251 feels light and nimble with an eagerness to be flung through bends
5545252 power is up 24 horsepower at 330 and the torque output increases two pound feet to 270
5545253 the engine makes great music as it happily revs to the red line
5545254 g37 journey accelerated to 60 mph in 5 5 seconds while a sport 6mt coupe pulled a nearly identical 5 4 seconds to 60 mph
5545255 the base and journey trim levels come standard with a five speed automatic transmission with paddle shift automanual control while the sport 6mt features a six speed manual
5545256 both gearboxes work precisely and are well matched to the potent engine
5545257 infiniti estimates that the g37s engine actually delivers around 1 mpg better gas mileage than the 3 5 liter v 6 in the g35
5545258 performance focused drivers hoping for a more sophisticated premium badged infiniti g37
5545259 through all but the most aggressive curves the car stays as flat as the arizona desert
5545260 the chassis soaks up road bumps without the slightest chatter and the steering remains precise and communicative
5545261 fails to weight up properly in the corners and provides limited feedback
5545262 stellar exhibiting excellent response and pedal feel and no fade
5545263 adults sardined in the back are faced with the option of tilting their heads sideways or slouching past the point of reasonable comfort
5545264 improved materials including aluminum trim that resembles handmade japanese washi paper collectively raise the bars of luxury and sport
5545265 adults sardined in the back are faced with the option of tilting their heads sideways or slouching past the point of reasonable comfort
5545266 as in many coupes rear legroom is scant and rear headroom is particularly compromised by the g37s severely raked back window
5545267 as in any coupe the front seats are the place to be
5545268 the available sport seats with their adjustable bolsters are very comfortable and snugly hold you in place
5545269 the trunk is on the small side with only 7 4 cubic feet of space
5545270 the visually soft aluminum alloy trim inspired by japanese washi paper infiniti says as well as the optional african rosewood trim
5545271 quite as melodic as the bmw 335is twin turbo straight six
5545272 all g37s come standard with six airbags including side impact airbags for the front seats
5545273 all 2008 infiniti g37s come standard with stability control traction control front seat side airbags
5545274 a preview braking function is included with the optional laser guided intelligent cruise control that automatically pre pressurizes the brake lines in anticipation of a panic stop

5545282 if you squint your eyes the front end of this car looks like a baby jaguar xk aston martin
5545283 a more muscular looking hood and the front fenders and grille area
5545284 the hyundai tiburons exterior design is an amalgamation of design cues from various makes if you squint your eyes the front end of this car looks like a baby jaguar xk aston martin which is not a bad thing
5545285 body features a high belt line and a short greenhouse with a steeply raked windshield and back window
5545286 a more muscular looking hood and the front fenders and grille area having a slightly more aerodynamic and sleek appearance
5545287 the tiburon the name means shark in spanish has improved in both looks and performance
5545288 is quite nice although the materials arent great cool blue lighting on the gauges and controls dress up the interior
5545289 the seats in the hyundai tiburon 2008 gt feature red leather accents
5545290 seem out of place and clash with the blue lighting
5545291 the 2008 hyundai tiburon has a simple but handsome cockpit at first glance its evident that the interior designers wanted to impart a high quality look and feel to the cabin
5545292 enough midrange power to manage highway merging and passing without too much drama
5545293 makes a nice throaty sound when you rev it to its 6500 rpm redline
5545294 although smooth the v6 is considerably down on power for this segment
5545295 shapely lines dont quite translate to the sporty driving experience one might expect
5545296 low end grunt is minimal but there is enough midrange power to manage highway merging and passing without too much drama
5545297 the hyundai tiburon ses v6 engine makes 172 horsepower considered modest for this class nowadays but it makes a nice throaty sound when you rev it to its 6500 rpm redline
5545298 delivers sprightly acceleration from a standing start through much of the rev range
5545299 although the gearshifter is notchy the clutch take up is linear
5545300 shifting gears is something of a mixed bag the gearshifts throws are a bit long and those accustomed to snappy footwork will bemoan the lengthy clutch
5545301 ses six speed gearbox is good and the clutch is smooth but the shift lever has too long a throw to feel tight heel and toe downshifts are challenging because of the pedal locations
5545302 a 6 speed se clocked 0 60 mph in 7
5545303 the automatic saps midrange punch but using the manual shift gate helps
5545304 although the ride is a little brittle the tib at least is more fun to drive when you start pushing it which is one reason it remains popular with street tuners steering is uncommunicative but direct
5545305 the tiburons shapely lines dont quite translate to the sporty driving experience one might expect the ride is bouncy on rough pavement
5545306 even though the car stays properly on course it doesnt impart a full sense of security
5545307 is a bit light except on se it is quick and informative
5545308 is confident but not eager and its steering is a bit slow and numb however when driven in a relaxed manner this hyundai performs capably and delivers a smooth ride
5545309 legroom and elbow space are good but headroom is meager
5545310 the cabins good looking trim belies tiburons pricing and includes ample soft touch surfaces
5545311 up to four people can fit inside the hyundai tiburon seats are supportive and legroom and elbow space are good but headroom is meager
5545312 low slung seats tax entry and exit plus they combine with shallow side windows for a closed in feel rear seats are unsuitable for occupants over 5 ft 6 because of the low roof and rear window and entry and exit is very tight
5545313 you may not like this car if you need more rear seating since legroom back there is minimal
5545314 small item storage is okay but many rivals do better
5545315 good looking trim belies its pricing and includes ample soft touch surfaces
5545316 everything is laid out in a straightforward fashion free of gimmickry the large speedometer and tachometer are easy to read at a glance
5545317 the hatch adds to the excessive wind and road noise that filter into the cabin
5545318 the v6 engine intrudes under full power and coarse surface tire noise is marked and wind rush is acceptable in gentle cruising but excess buffeting discourages lowered windows even at modest speeds
5545319 includes front airbags front side impact airbags seatbelt pretensioners and force limiters anti lock brakes with electronic brake force distribution and a tire pressure monitor
5545320 electronic stability control esc with brake assist and traction control
5545321 visibility is substantial despite the rear spoiler that divides the view through the large hatchback window
5545322 the tiburon se the sportiest version has a lot of standard equipment that often costs extra on the competition
5545323 optional tilt and slide sunroof allows in fresh air and sunshine
5545324 beginning with the inexpensive gs which includes power windows doors and heated mirrors air conditioning keyless entry tilt steering a 220 watt kenwood mp3 sound system xm satellite radio fog lamps and 16 inch alloy wheels
5545325 black leather seat bolsters with cloth inserts leather wrapped steering wheel and shift knob adjustable lumbar support automatic climate control trip computer and metallic trim
5545326 a suspension set up for hard cornering and comes with the same the 2 7 liter v6 as the gt and gt limited
5545327 has a lot of standard equipment that often costs extra on the competition such as air conditioning cruise control keyless entry with alarm 17 inch alloy wheels and four airbags
5545328 convenient features that are standard on the entire line include a kenwood am fm cd mp3 stereo with six speakers a timed rear window defroster heated and powered outside mirrors tire pressure monitoring system fog lights and anti lock brakes
5545329 bluetooth hands free phone system 325 cargo net 45 carpeted floor mats 90 mud guards 85 sunroof wind deflector 85 and wheel locks 40
5545330 optional tilt and slide sunroof allows in fresh air and sunshine
5545331 aside from floor mats and a cargo net for the trunk few other options are available on the se but little else is necessary
5545332 they had details of explosives and poisons along with information about london landmarks and a computer folder on royal residences we would be foolish to rule out the fact that they may have been planning an attack
5545333 ive still got a rather lengthy amount of time before i decide anything
5545334 the pendulum is swinging very heavily in the direction of it just being over ive never sat around and not gotten ready to head to florida well not in 23 or so years anyway so to me that will likely be the last real test for me and whether or not i want to put the time and effort into getting after it one more time
5545335 next i started thinking about the original plan of pitching the 2nd half of next season thing is that urgency just is not there i miss some things i didnt think i would and dont miss many things
5545336 ive still got a rather lengthy amount of time before i decide anything

5545338 next i started thinking about the original plan of pitching the 2nd half of next season thing is that urgency just is not there i miss some things i didnt think i would and dont miss many things
5545339 the world has seen that even today there are political morons who are ready to kill innocent and defenseless people in order to satisfy their self serving interests while compensating for their own inability to resolve complicated issues by using the most terrible solution by exterminating an entire people
5545340 i think that there should be no mercy for that we will do our best not to let this crime go unpunished
5545341 you just dont move more than 1 200 tanks and 15 000 soldiers into a country within 12 hours without previous planning
5545342 were talking about pulling our troops away to the borders of south ossetia they will not be on georgia territory
5545343 russians have committed to withdrawing and they need to withdraw and so that is what we are looking for
5545344 we were all set and then the georgians came up with a bunch of new requirements with no time for us to act so the time to exchange prisoners was interrupted
5545345 russian forces continue to consolidate their enclaves in south ossetia and abkhazia
5545346 mounting evidence that russian and georgian military used armed force unlawfully during the south ossetian conflict
5545347 highlights the need for international fact finding missions in georgia
5545348 theres a great diversity of religious beliefs in california and theyre all protected but not to the point where laws are violated and other people are hurt
5545349 each of us is protected both in our religious beliefs and also from religiously based discrimination in the doctors office and other commercial settings
5545350 its not you its me sort of things in fact the look of the soft white theme was a good fit for those long heck of a guy posts cutline seems to me to be a bit distracting

5545356 answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
5545357 is it a threat a warning or a bluff all we really know about the photograph is that the government of iran wanted to get the attention of the world and it succeeded
5545358 dude no problem we could just fix it in photoshop
5545359 dont worry well be home soon be a good boy
5545360 has the look and feel of a true enthusiast vehicle inside and out
5545361 the sport trim level is distinguished by a different front face and side sills
5545362 crisp lines and sensual contours into a tasteful yet visually distinctive styling statement
5545363 runs from the front wheel arch and along the door handles and drapes over the rear wheel arch
5545364 eye catching grille treatment with four sculpted bars that twist from center to edge like traditional japanese sword blades
5545365 flush fit l shaped headlights and taillights that flow around the fenders front and rear
5545366 cockpit like ambiance may strike some as a bit busy
5545367 controls are logically arranged and the flashy electroluminescent main gauges are quite legible
5545368 steering wheel rim may block full view of gauges for some drivers
5545369 legibility tends to come or go based upon the amount of reflecting sunlight
5545370 the five speed transmission is smooth in auto mode and holds shifts on the redline
5545371 offers both rear wheel drive and all wheel drive configurations
5545372 to 60 mph in 5 4 seconds about the same as g35 sports
5545373 most models will have a five speed automatic transmission with manual shift control and downshift rev matching
5545374 a six speed manual transmission is exclusive to the sport 6mt
5545375 employs rev matching that automatically gooses the engine speed before the gears mesh providing exceptionally smooth downshifts and reduced wear
5545376 test awd sedan averaged 19 7 in mostly highway driving
5545377 the sport has the best road holding because of its firmer springs and standard summer performance tires
5545378 the all wheel drive keeps the g35x more planted and secure in bad weather
5545379 nearly everyone had kind words for the 16 way adjustable drivers seat
5545380 include manual thigh extenders just like the bmw 3 series
5545381 a fairly long wheelbase of 112 2 inches makes for a spacious cabin for passengers whether theyre up front or in back
5545382 rear passengers will find the g35 sedans rear bench seat belted for three but contoured for two average sized adults at best
5545383 the design of the cupholders and interior storage is lacking in terms of functionality
5545384 infiniti wisely gave up on the fake stuff and went with real textured aluminum trim
5545385 the leather covering the seats and steering wheel just isnt as rich as what bmw uses in the 3 series
5545386 evident on coarse surfaces especially with available 18 and 19 inch tires
5545387 safety features include dual stage front airbags side impact airbags for both front seats
5545388 measures taken from the dummy indicate a low risk of any significant injuries in a crash of this severity
5545389 anti whiplash front head restraints traction control and stability control are standard on all g35s
5545390 dual stage front airbags side impact airbags for both front seats and side curtain airbags that cover the front and rear side windows in a side impact
5545391 rearview monitor shows whats behind the vehicle on the dashboards optional navigation screen when the automatic transmission is in reverse
5545392 dual zone climate controls 8 way power passenger seat am fm radio w in dash 6 disc cd mp3 changer
5545393 the g35 offers multiple upgrade packages and several individual extras although only for the journey g35x or sport 6m models
5545394 includes deep bolstered front bucket seats 18 inch alloy wheels wearing dunlop sp sport maxx m s tires and magnesium paddle shifters
5545395 a premium package adds a sunroof power steering column driver position memory
5545396 the sportage looks and feels a lot classier than you think it would
5545397 distinctive design is modern clean and attractive a curvaceous almost organic look with a get up and go attitude
5545398 pleasantly impressed with kia sportage as far as looks are concerned
5545399 improved plastics and upholstery throughout the 2008 kia sportage lineup attractive cloth upholstery gives an impression of comfort and durability adding to the upscale appeal are aluminized accents on both the instrument and door panels
5545400 looks and feels a lot classier than you think it would
5545401 certainly isnt going to dazzle you with dual temperature controls power seating or a bose stereo the center console and dashboard are still modern and sleek in design with basic features
5545402 it will meet consumer expectations but we dont believe it will exceed them
5545403 2008 kia sportage four cylinder models are fine for light duty commuting but lack enough power for confident highway merging and passing
5545404 not overly impressed by the responsiveness of the kia 2008 v6 it will meet consumer expectations but we dont believe it will exceed them
5545405 four cylinder should be reserved for light duty only no full loads light towing and little exposure to work at high altitudes
5545406 a five speed manual gearbox is standard in the four cylinder kia sportage lx and a four speed automatic is available
5545407 all v 6 models come with the automatic automatic transmission responses are prompt but downshifting can be sluggish when passing
5545408 the automatic transmission is responsive enough with either engine though not even the v6 has abundant passing punch
5545409 v6s have a 17 2 gallon fuel tank vs 15 3 gallons for 4 cylinder models
5545410 on rougher pavement the ride is well cushioned suspension reactions are seldom excessive and recovery is prompt
5545411 maneuvering smartly and steering with a somewhat light touch the 2008 kia sportage feels satisfyingly secure on rain soaked pavement on expressways however it takes some concentration to stay centered in your lane
5545412 the trade off is an inability to tackle the harshest sorts of off road terrain
5545413 the fifth passengers area in the center of the rear seat is somewhat marginal
5545414 kia sportage seating position is appropriately upright and while the standard sunroof encroaches slightly on rear seat headroom most adults will find either front or rear seating to be generous
5545415 the fifth passengers area in the center of the rear seat is somewhat marginal
5545416 legroom is adequate and headroom is generous both the leather and the cloth seats are comfortable with good side bolster support
5545417 with the drop and fold rear seating system the seat cushion lowers and the backrest folds flat yielding 66 6 cubic feet of cargo space
5545418 groceries fit fine behind the rear seats but theres little room for large objects
5545419 the kia sportage rear seats fold easily in one motion to form a flat load floor
5545420 dashboard control dials have rubber grips literally a nice touch
5545421 for interior materials kia sportage is a cut above honda cr v and is slightly upscale of tucson
5545422 quality plastics with an almost quantum improvement in both appearance and texture
5545423 other than a little tire noise on some surfaces the sportage is quiet though the engine gets snarly at high rpm
5545424 4 cylinder engine is coarse and buzzy the v6 is quiet at cruise but it strains loudly at higher rpm
5545425 rear roof styling impedes vision to right rear and dead astern
5545426 all disc antilock brakes traction control and an electronic stability system are standard
5545427 kia 2008 rear roof styling impedes vision to right rear and dead astern
5545428 kia sportage ex adds heated mirrors remote keyless entry a cargo cover and a leather wrapped steering wheel v 6 models get standard cruise control
5545429 sunroof power windows heated outside mirrors trip computer roof rack and keyless entry do not come as an extra cost or better known as an upgrade package which is nice
5545430 with all that is standard the customer is left with little to add the less expensive 2008 kia sportage lx gives the customer more variables although many of those would be dealer installed
5545431 on the ex a luxury package includes body colored bumpers leather seats and trim heated front seats automatic headlamps and a six disc cd changer amplifier and subwoofer
5545432 theres a lot of incidents where that would have saved a number of lives
5545433 commitment to producing the works of william shakespeare and his contemporaries along with other classical theatre repertoire and the work of living playwrights
5545434 we havent simply come up with a list of plays and slotted people in we have encouraged artists to come forward with their own dream projects
5545435 he is certainly our greatest playwright but to truly know his work it is vital to explore the plays of his contemporaries which is why we present ben jonsons rollicking city comedy bartholomew fair
5545436 overall it is an enjoyable and luxurious vehicle to look at
5545437 vehicle appears as if it is moving quickly even when at rest
5545438 trimmed with simulated metal pieces but real wood trim is also available
5545439 features an upright grille thats flanked by standard high intensity discharge headlights other design features include a downward sloping roofline side vents in the front fenders rocker panel moldings and standard 19 inch alloy wheels with low profile tires
5545440 manages to combine range rovers familiar cubist styling with a raked windscreen and a tapered roofline that makes the vehicle appear as if it is moving quickly even when at rest
5545441 overall it is an enjoyable and luxurious vehicle to drive as well as look at
5545442 is trimmed with simulated metal pieces but real wood trim is also available
5545443 the gauge lettering is small and difficult to read and the black lettered lcd readouts practically disappear when viewed through polarized lenses
5545444 a larger typeface would enhance the legibility of the gauges
5545445 climate dials are big and obvious but effort is required to sort out the multitude of other buttons and knobs
5545446 setting terrain response hill descent control and other off road gear puzzles the uninitiated
5545447 can carry just about anything short of a chevy suburban load but power isnt what it needs to be to carry the vehicle with a load of adults and gear down the highway
5545448 the land rover 2008 hses acceleration can only be described as adequate and the engine works hard to propel this portly suv
5545449 the supercharger is most appreciated when passing at high speeds and scooting across bustling intersections
5545450 both engines drive a six speed automatic transmission with a clutchless manual mode that sends power to each wheel through a permanent four wheel drive system
5545451 it kicks down way too much to maintain highway speed but maybe that was the fuel saving sixth gear talking
5545452 on the upside this vehicle glides down the highway and is barely rattled by anything the back roads can dish out the truck stays on center so steadily that you actually can take your hands off the wheel and not stray from a straight line course very impressive for a 5600 pounder with these kinds of off road underpinnings
5545453 a stable confident highway ride the four wheel independent air suspension delivers ride quality thats on the firm side bumps and holes are felt and heard
5545454 both models react firmly to bumps in the manner of a european sport sedan
5545455 land rover says the optional dynamic response anti roll system works to control body roll and it did so handily when driving the range rover sport on twisty roads especially when you consider its near 6 foot height and 5 500 pound curb weight
5545456 the shocking thing about the range rover sport is how amazingly well it stops our 5629 pound hse test vehicle did the 70 to 0 mph deed in just 165 feet which far outclasses everything in its suv category
5545457 head clearance is adequate but larger passengers lack wiggle room
5545458 electronics also are a bit nervous interface doesnt do anything easily
5545459 head clearance is adequate but larger passengers lack wiggle room in the footwell which is pinched by a wide center console and the low dashboard housing
5545460 snug but comfortable seating offers good thigh support in the front bucket seats and roomy rear seat
5545461 interior cargo room measures 33 8 cubic feet but grows to 71 cubic feet when the 65 35 split rear bench seat is folded
5545462 the two step rear seat folding process creates a relatively long and flat load floor
5545463 double tier glovebox and multiple console bins contribute to good small item storage space
5545464 electronics also are a bit nervous the touch screen combined with the hard button interface doesnt do anything quite completely or easily
5545465 richly padded cabin surfaces are abundant but some materials disappoint for the price and the metal look trim should be aluminum not painted plastic
5545466 suffered from myriad squeaks and a small leak from the sunroof after a heavy rainfall
5545467 doesnt suppress wind and road noise at highway speeds as well as its premium midsize rivals around town though it fares better
5545468 the supercharger whines in fast acceleration but it never annoys
5545469 include antilock brakes side impact airbags for the front seats side curtain airbags an electronic stability system with rollover mitigation technology and front and rear parking sensors
5545470 can be equipped with adaptive cruise control that maintains a preset distance between the range rover sport and a vehicle in front of it
5545471 large windows and high seating position give the driver a commanding view of the road
5545472 fog lamps eight way power drivers seat dual zone automatic climate control
5545473 equipped with a naturally aspirated 4 4 liter v8 six speed zf automatic transmission with commandshift manual shift mode electronic air suspension 19 inch alloy wheels dynamic stability control dsc hill descent control hdc terrain response four wheel drive system traction control front side impact airbags side curtain airbags bi xenon headlamps fog lamps eight way power drivers seat dual zone automatic climate control park distance control bluetooth phone integration harman kardon logic 7 stereo with six disc mp3 cd audio and 14 speakers and dvd gps navigation with voice recognition and seven inch lcd view screen
5545474 theres no backup camera no power liftgate and theres no auxiliary jack for an mp3 player
5545475 i did give documents a long time ago but these matters have been resolved for a long time now as far as im concerned
5545476 why would i that would be like weeping because i won the lottery mom is in a much better place now then she was here her and dad fought for everything they ever had she fought for nearly 20 years after dad was gone she fought to hang on because she didnt want any of us kids to hurt shes done fighting now and im happy for her
5545477 when i was on the bike i was sick and every time i took on fluids i was sick again
5545478 its not great when youve got sick down your arms and your new white shoes are ruined
5545479 i have always told myself i would never not finish a race and its hard to describe how i feel having to pull out
5545480 tomorrows game will be a huge game definitely we came here to get to the medal round so tomorrow is huge
5545481 i guess its a little different here tempers were high but i dont know what the implications are here
5545482 when you come in and have a collision at home you never hit someone in the chest
5545483 it was an illegal slide the umpire should have ejected him at that point
5545484 i would rather have slid but the catcher was in the way
5545485 you cant blame me im just a stupid programmable machine not a thinking human

5545496 mejor dicho nos dejan el hueso porque los hospitales deben atender las urgencias y pagarle a sus empleados recargos nocturnos dominicales festivos y todas las prestaciones de ley mientras los contratistas part culares se llevar n la carne del negocio atendiendo de lunes a viernes en horas de oficina

5545499 taiwanese consumer foundation claims microsoft is effectively using its monopoly to force sales of vista
5545500 i caught him with a couple of big right hands and im not really sure what happened to his leg
5545501 its a great feeling but a bit of an anti climax the way it happened im not going to complain though a win is a win and i think i was going to do him anyway
5545502 that was one of the low points of my career
5545503 but we always knew wed meet him somewhere down the line
5545504 he knows i could have made it very hard for him at the worlds im a completely different fighter to what i was four years ago
5545505 i know ive got the tools to beat him and ive got everything to gain
5545506 it was great to have them here but it also made nervous i wanted to give them an excuse to go out for a bevvy
5545507 four years ago he was a boy in a mans body
5545508 hes come along tremendously since then hes got size hes got reach and he uses that to his advantage
5545509 these interrogations and checkpoints are comparable to police practices in authoritarian regimes and especially apartheid era south africa which is even more ominous given the fact the residents of these new red zones are mostly african american and poor
5545510 such measures also recall the repression by police and private security firms in post katrina new orleans which accompanied the obstruction and expulsion of mostly poor and black residents from their homes
5545511 these policies have only empowered criminal gangs involved in the drug trade just as prohibition fed the growth of organized crime the aclu is right two of our most important freedoms the right of mobility and protection against warrantless search and seizure are being nullified for the sake of the disastrous war on drugs in violation of local law and the us constitution
5545512 a city that hands its police force a license to trash the constitutional rights of its citizens is not a city that is upholding law and order and protecting its citizens on the contrary unlimited police power is a complete breakdown of the law
5545513 democratic and republican politicians are equally responsible for the transformation of civilian police into militias
5545514 the drug war has very little to do with drugs its about control coercion and power its about money america wont get sane drug laws and law enforcement until enough greens get elected to public office to overturn these self defeating unconstitutional policies
5545515 see that you do not do that i am your fellow servant and of your brethren who have the testimony of jesus worship god for the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy
5545516 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
5545517 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
5545518 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5545519 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5545520 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5545521 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5545522 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5545523 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks
5545524 it came in through all three doors that i have
5545525 if a whole bunch of them had two or three
5545526 i did give documents a long time ago but these matters have been resolved for a long time now as far as im concerned

5545535 the town is desperately short of women we just havent got women here hes highlighted the problem and the way hes said it hes got national publicity hes just letting people know its good fun to be a woman in mount isa if hes got to take a few brickbats on the head that wont bother molony

5545538 since this is a beta release applications developed with it may not quite be compatible with devices running the final android 1 0
5545539 will give developers a chance to build polished applications once hardware is available
5545540 due to significant api changes in the upstream open source project and due to the timeline of getting certain bluetooth profile implementations certified a comprehensive bluetooth api will not be possible or present in android 1 0
5545541 due to the security risks inherent in accepting arbitrary data from outside the device the data messaging facility of the gtalkservice will not be present in android 1 0
5545542 we know that these changes will affect many developers who have worked with the prior early looks at the sdk and we are very sorry for the resulting inconvenience
5545543 we look forward to the possibility of restoring some or all of this functionality in a later version of the android platform
5545544 were the only industry of this size and scope that doesnt have a real voice in this process at best were humored at worst were ignored
5545545 is it making our community stronger or are we trapped in that model
5545546 the philanthropic dollars provide us the money to experiment and try new things
5545547 philanthropy can fail in a way that government cant but we can catalyze government investment in growing what works
5545548 there are a lot of people in this sector who will get nervous about the federal government becoming too engaged in philanthropy
5545549 but theres also this other argument that we dont want an agency that is going to over regulate us
5545550 their disappointment when they learnt the system was only on trial and might be removed said it all

5545556 in the exchange landscape of the future there will be three to four big companies global with different types of products

5545559 por el pretexto de la autonom a sindical hay quien se enriqueci de los sindicatos

5545563 la ciudadan a en general estamos en espera de las propuestas del estado para saber qu es lo que se va hacer y lo que a cada uno nos corresponde hacer
5545564 todos juguemos un papel y contribuyamos a combatir todo tipo de delincuencia
5545565 s quieren que se resuelvan los problemas pero hay quienes quieren seguir aprovechando esta situaci n de confusi n y de deterioro que vivimos
5545566 s lo falta que quieran imponer instrumentos como el cintur n de castidad que obligaban portar a las mujeres
5545567 jesucristo nuestro se or y salvador dice que el problema est en el coraz n del hombre o de la mujer no en el atav o a nosotros nos parece hip crita y fariseo por decir lo menos que se pretenda culpar a la mujer de los abusos en su contra por su forma de vestir
5545568 ser responsabilidad de cada persona pero para nosotros este es un problema que debe resolverse en el coraz n de cada ser humano
5545569 es un asunto de todos y acci n nacional no evade ni escurre la responsabilidad que le toca
5545570 el pa s las v ctimas las familias de las v ctimas de la inseguridad no merecen que la inseguridad sea motivo de conflicto entre partidos
5545571 ya basta de culparnos entre nosotros le decimos que la seguridad es un asunto de todos y no evadimos la responsabilidad que le toca a los gobernantes que emergieron de acci n nacional
5545572 que el homicidio y el secuestro son asuntos locales que se persiguen por los gobernadores y que ellos en ese mbito de competencia tienen la mitad del pa s est n gobernando la mitad del pa s para perseguir los homicidios y los secuestros
5545573 culpas entre todas las autoridades mientras nosotros nos repartimos culpas la delincuencia avanza en las calles y eso no se lo merece m xico
5545574 hay una falta de voluntad muy fuerte por parte de las autoridades mexicanas para solucionar este tema
5545575 los periodistas y sus familiares prefieren no denunciar porque saben que no va a pasar nada
5545576 hay una creciente cultura de la impunidad que empeora cada d a

5545582 every time i go to a school calf club day there are grandmothers and grandfathers who went to calf club as kids
5545583 i know in matamata there are four generations of families that have been part of calf club
5545584 owning caring and training young animals requires motivation commitment responsibility and compassion and calf club provides a wonderful opportunity for children to learn these skills
5545585 in my opinion people who have been through calf club often turn out to be a better stockperson
5545586 to get a lamb or a calf to come to your call requires a real bonding you dont get that by being aggressive you have to bond with the animal

5545590 heres one certainty in the hubbub that has resulted in the wake of the departure of high profile exec ben ling from facebook last week coo sheryl sandberg is definitely not responsible for the melting of the polar ice caps
5545591 she demands total loyalty and brooks no dissent even the healthy boisterous debate thats common to startups

5545593 ben wanted a bigger job and he was using the prospect of going to google as a hammer
5545594 but he was not doing a good enough job with what he had been running to make such demands
5545595 i have huge respect for elliot and work well with him
5545596 facebook is a tremendous organization and i would not leave it if it were not for a great opportunity
5545597 facebook confirms that ben ling will be leaving the company in the coming weeks to pursue other interests we wish him well and appreciate his great contributions to the early success of facebook platform
5545598 how could he guarantee that someone was not going to find out and then he would have had to tell a lie about his plans
5545599 especially given facebook is the leakiest place in the valley
5545600 he insinuated he was going to talk badly about all of us and we did not want to deal with him acting like that
5545601 why they didnt give him some credit for his work and align his interests with theirs by being more generous is a mystery to all of us
5545602 his fall from grace makes you think anyone could go from valued employee to bum pretty quickly
5545603 ben is a really smart guy and google is probably a better place for him
5545604 he will probably do well but he did not do well here
5545605 oxxford just wasnt selling so we are dropping the line in this store
5545606 optimum health is not just the absence of disease but the presence of wellness in mental emotional physical spiritual and social areas some would also include financial health
5545607 the world has enough for everyones needs but not enough for even a single persons greed
5545608 boy i have two tigers caged within me one is love and compassion the other is fear and anger
5545609 everybody in this room could be donating to some other cause or to their own well being but i want to thank you
5545610 faced with the embarrassing prospect of holding a fundraiser with one of s closest associates the mccain campaign scrambled today to scratch ralph reed from tonights program but voters deserve to know the answers to the real questions raised by reeds involvement
5545611 if the mccain campaign wont return the money reed has raised for them then voters should rightly ask why it matters that reed didnt show up at tonights event the real question isnt why reed isnt showing up but why a so called reformer would invite him at all
5545612 before the obama campaign launches attacks they should stop and think about the amount of money that has been raised through convicted criminal and longtime fundraiser tony rezko
5545613 it takes a lot of audacity for obama and his spokespeople to criticize when obama was involved in a questionable home purchase with rezkos wife and years of friendship and dealings with a man convicted of wire and mail fraud money laundering and aiding and abetting bribery
5545614 if you cant do it awesome then why the fuck do it at all
5545615 chill for at least three hours in the fridge run it through the machine until its like soft serve then harden off in the freezer for a few hours or until you cannot possibly stand it any more
5545616 ignorance and obscurantism have never produced anything other than flocks of slaves for tyranny
5545617 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
5545618 ignorance and obscurantism have never produced anything other than flocks of slaves for tyranny
5545619 ignorance and obscurantism have never produced anything other than flocks of slaves for tyranny
5545620 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
5545621 the people who cast the votes decide nothing the people who count the votes decide everything
5545622 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
5545623 the people who cast the votes decide nothing the people who count the votes decide everything
5545624 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
5545625 the people who cast the votes decide nothing the people who count the votes decide everything
5545626 every day theres the possibility there could be some type of disaster in the financials
5545627 major lenders for the housing market in the united states so bad news there usually affects the homebuilders and all of the financials
5545628 there is some hard thinking that needs to be done
5545629 the fed has a terrific reputation as a credible institution we have to be cautious not to undertake things that put that credibility at risk
5545630 neither one of us could probably answer why we were getting one in the first place
5545631 things have been going so great that someone actually had to remind us that hey you do remember those papers are still there literally it was days ago
5545632 so weve agreed that before we leave florida in a few days well make sure that thats gone away
5545633 the kids and i kind of learned about the divorce at the same time
5545634 so that was hard that was probably the worst part of the whole thing was being able to deal with how hurt the whole kids were
5545635 leaders like katti padma rao will be a big asset for us
5545636 i am not quitting the congress party for any position or power i am doing it because there is no social justice in the party i will not contest the next elections but only campaign for chiranjeevi as an ordinary worker
5545637 there is no place for hard working people in the tdp
5545638 there are good people in every party and i dont see anything wrong in taking them in my party if they come forward they are senior people and we need the experience of senior people as well as the young blood
5545639 im not considered for vice president by anybody its not even a passing thought
5545640 im not the ideal mix for a guy like obama for a huge variety of reasons hes a midwesterner im a midwesterner hes a senator im a senator
5545641 obamas looking for someone who would presumably balance the ticket and i dont think most people would see me as balancing an obama ticket
5545642 but thats not necessarily what obama and his aides are thinking i think we would all have to agree that hasnt been their direction since the nomination was cinched
5545643 it is always hard to see a candidate even though i like him very much move on certain issues in a direction im uncomfortable with
5545644 i still think that his choosing somebody who has a credibility on foreign policy and military issues to make sure with people are comfortable with the democrats on that in light of the instability in the world is probably the best approach
5545645 i dont think obama does well by trying to pick somebody who is going to win a state for him i can understand mccain doing that with a former massachusetts governor mitt romney a minnesota governor tim pawlenty or a former pennsylvania governor tom ridge i think obama has a different way of running and that is a national wave of excitement based on his candidacy and a strong ticket i wouldnt cherry pick a running mate just to try and carry a state thats not what he needs
5545646 be conscious of how things are made and processed and by that awareness things will naturally shift
5545647 im not advocating giving up meat or becoming a vegetarian or vegan what i talk about is being conscious just being aware having your eyes open your heart open
5545648 i think we all want a fresh start from time to time and you want to reboot the system and sometimes you want to start down a new and healthier road but you need to clear out the old stuff first
5545649 after three weeks your tastes have changed youre not craving the same things you did before and it is sort of like a good fresh start
5545650 take things as they come and listen let it move you and be willing to make a shift
5545651 just close your eyes get centered and count to 10 and that mini meditation will change your chemistry
5545652 it will relax your central nervous system and you will also feel very grounded inspired and creative
5545653 informed consent documenting the intersection of bureaucratic regulation and ethnographic practice
5545654 wary of inserting documents between my interlocutors and myself because of the sense of formality it introduced
5545655 it inserted the institution of cornell between community members and myself and that once institutions come into the mix indians are very and rightly skeptical
5545656 when preparing for the irb requirements i produced the consent form in a routine way according to guidelines for recorded interviews
5545657 235 this kind of irb caused harm is impossible to track but i suspect it is rather common when you flood the web with bad advice about research ethics it is bound to cause unknown harms
5545658 was more flexible and community members could discuss their own stipulations for consent and use of the material
5545659 do not sign this form without reading and understanding its contents
5545660 oh i feel much more protected now that i signed this
5545661 images tapes and transcripts of interviews will be placed in the archives of the nmai
5545662 if this continues its going to put us out of the baby business
5545663 if they can buy commodities more intelligently than their competitors that can be a competitive advantage
5545664 whenever you think youre close to an agreement you find youre further away and when you think all is lost you find out an hour later that its still possible so were where we usually are in budget times in april where we are working hard everyones cooperating and we dont agree thats why we are in a democracy

5545669 how can we make this fight harder for hard and dmd modes
5545670 it may give more choice in the primary election but less choice in the general election and thats where we elect our leaders were not sure what the disease is but the cure is obviously worse than the disease
5545671 we dont have anybody else to turn to but god
5545672 we have to turn these problems over to god and not to man

5545677 i ended a relationship because there was no lying i ended a relationship to be alone because i dont want to waste somebodys time if somethings not right i dont waste peoples time i dont do the taper

5545682 the children are working hard and learning much more than whats expected of them in a years time
5545683 tennessee is about 10 years ahead of the rest of the country in terms of the amount and quality of data that can inform the public about which schools are actually doing the most for students
5545684 despite all of the concerns about the metro schools that have been voiced in recent months and years we want parents to know that the metro schools also include some of the top performers in tennessee
5545685 metro has a lot of hurdles to overcome and i feel like our schools system is doing a great job we still have a long way to go
5545686 was it different because the songs were actually by and performed by someone with autism

5545696 the industry is now taking responsibility for correcting a problem they helped create and well continue working to make all investors whole
5545697 at the heart of this investigation is the simple goal of returning billions of dollars back into the hands of investors which in turn injects confidence into the entire market
5545698 every time i close my eyes i see them there on the floor i see their bodies
5545699 i dont have any pictures of them in my house anymore i dont watch any spanish shows on television anymore i dont want to remember
5545700 your love comes out your hands it all comes out of your hands make me remember who i am
5545701 you should know and you will see the air you breathe across the shining sea youll always be a part of me no matter where you go you will always be a part of me
5545702 im unprofessional and i am not taking this job opportunity seriously
5545703 i will be supporting the removal of abortion from the crimes act i think thats the right thing its the right thing in terms of public policy mr brumby said
5545704 but i would stress that the proposal we are putting to the parliament is one that would be consistent and fully consistent with current clinical practice
5545705 for women i think its a crucial matter for them that a personal decision theyve made about themselves and their body is subject to action under the criminal code
5545706 removing this from the criminal code is important for women it is something that many women and many womens organisations have fought long and hard for so i think its important

5545741 the advantage of ercs is that they can be used in an off the shelf manner meaning they can be delivered to the point of care do not require matching and are easily injectable without the need for complex equipment
5545742 we are proud of assembling such a strong clinically experienced team to contribute to these studies
5545743 dr ewa carrier and suman kambhampati are hematologists who use stem cells on a regular basis dr angle is a vascular surgeon who like dr murphy sees cli on a daily basis and dr amit patel has performed numerous cardiac stem cell clinical trials with such a team that understands not only the science but also the practical implementation we feel we are well positioned to translate this discovery into a practical therapy in the near future
5545744 if you understand shape you can understand the function of those molecules
5545745 i instructed my student to party with wine students that weekend to see what she could find out
5545746 so i went to safeway and bought red wine vinegar and red wine

5545752 once you get inside we are a very high performance software development company we run it on computing systems that we built ourselves weve automated most of the manual labor out of the process most of the protomold side the tool making side in our industry by other companies has gone to china we use our software and parallel processing to automate a lot of that design and manual programming to cut out those molds we do it here in maple plain 20 miles west of downtown minneapolis and in telford england
5545753 assuming he designed the product right that xerox engineer will get the molds and parts for each of the plastic products he ordered within five or six days
5545754 nobody else can do 50 or more molds and deliver all those parts within a week or two
5545755 we are proven profitable for years and very accepted in north america and europe we will get japan running next year and were working with thousands of customers none of whom represents more than 2 or 3 percent of revenue

5545778 recently magnetic nanoparticles were used for this purpose as these materials with the adsorbed heavy metals can be easily recovered by utilizing magnetic separation
5545779 however bare magnetite nanoparticles in aqueous systems are very much susceptible to air oxidation and are easily aggregated which resulted in reduced saturation magnetization and adsorption capacity for metals in our recent paper we describe the development of a novel material humic acid coated fe 3 o 4 magnetic nanoparticles to resolve theses problems
5545780 coating fe 3 o 4 magnetic nanoparticles with humic acid for high efficient removal of heavy metals in water
5545781 we were aware of recent research which indicated that humic acid has high affinity to fe 3 o 4 nanoparticles and that sorption of ha on the fe 3 o 4 nanoparticles enhanced the stability of nanodispersions by preventing their aggregation
5545782 it is also well known that ha which is abundant in natural aqueous systems has a skeleton of alkyl and aromatic units that attach with carboxylic acid phenolic hydroxyl and quinone functional groups these functional groups have high complex capacity with heavy metal ions and ha has therefore been applied to remove heavy metal ions from water
5545783 furthermore the proposed procedure was very efficient as the sorption equilibrium was reached in less than 20 min and the fe 3 o 4 ha with adsorbed heavy metals can be simply recovered from water with magnetic separations at very low magnetic field gradients within a few minutes

5545791 he was compelled as a matter of honor to turn up to the forum and explain himself to the leaders it is very disappointing that he wont turn up to effectively take his medicine
5545792 i think it speaks volumes that theyre not prepared to come and be accountable to forum leaders i think leaders are very keen to see the commitments that were made last time adhered to
5545793 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5545794 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5545795 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5545796 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5545797 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5545798 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5545799 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5545805 what really impressed me with this property and the rme team was the amount of information that was available to me before i actually clicked on a property i had all my due diligence done for me right there on the website
5545806 we know what its like to follow a real estate agent around with our children in the back seat of the car making multiple offers and being refused multiple times we dont have the time to do that so its wonderful to leverage other peoples time and expertise
5545807 we always knew we should be doing something in real estate for the long term but didnt have a clue as to how to get started after being involved in nouveau riche and attending the training seminars we decided to take the plunge and buy that first property it was kind of scary to click on the button but we knew we had to start somewhere it went very well rme made the whole process go very smoothly
5545808 when you can take advantage of someone else going out and providing the deals the way they do its awesome

5545822 the blog feels false to me very superficial like zipping up a socially correct costume with pretty pictures and benign writings my insides are on fire i have real life going on and dont see the blog as a forum for that kind of truth i gotta get back to deep writing in my journal and not the superficial duck amp dodge shite its become cuz im scared to write whats really going on what i really feel truth aint always pretty journal backgrounds i also find my art voice changes when i know im going to post it art for the audience not art the way i feel it i need to step back for a while and get my spine back i guess
5545823 and for those working abroad their voting rights rights enshrined in the federal constitution would be denied if we actually abolish the postal voting system so we are sticking to the system
5545824 i dont think so to me the fact that petitioners are able to file their complaints reflects the fertility of our countrys democracy but the law is supreme and only the law can decide whether or not the petitions filed are valid or otherwise
5545825 that one i hope you can give recommendations on how to improve the postal voting system
5545826 said although some councillors may deem the parade to be offensive she did not agree even if it was tacky
5545827 females walking down the street bare breasted was not unlawful but she added her decision was made by considering the law not morals
5545828 i dont think it would be productive for our football team you have to be a productive part to be an nfl player and theres responsibilities to being an nfl player its a privilege its not a right theres a lot that comes with being an nfl football player
5545829 ill agree the drink isnt cheap ill agree everyone should eat more fruits and berries you will agree that most north americans dont even come close to the recommended daily allowance
5545830 we save our crying for really important things like when the detroit tigers lose or stuff like that

5545832 hes not what he was when he was winning cy young awards but hell still keep you in the game
5545833 hes one of the smartest players ive ever been around hell figure out a way
5545834 the resources boom is providing employment and increased wealth for western australians but its also driving up carbon pollution and putting immense pressure on our fragile environment
5545835 the state election provides an opportunity for politcal parties to respond to public concern on the environment by committing to urgent and decisive action to prevent dangerous climate change and build a sustainable economy for the future
5545836 nothing more than another unnecessary and costly tax on businesses and consumers
5545837 in theory working with an unruly fractious coalition government is more difficult than working with someone who has most of the power in his own hands
5545838 but the problem with the theory in this case is that it never worked very well with musharraf
5545839 musharraf worked with us when it suited his interest and to the extent it suited his interest but i think most of us feel that our partnership with musharraf did not produce the fruits that we had hoped for
5545840 focus their collective minds on the major problems challenging both countries
5545841 what it will do is to remove the automatic link in the pakistani mind that any actions which are taken in the fata and in the frontier generally are american dictated
5545842 weakening that link means that decisions that pakistan is going to take are in its own interest
5545843 so if it moves more aggressively it wouldnt be automatically seen as simply carrying out american command
5545844 it wouldnt have taken einstein to work out they were holding something like that
5545845 the problem weve got is that we dont know what theyve got because it is such a secretive investigation we dont know what they are holding
5545846 im sure they have got all sorts of things that they are keeping
5545847 why did they criticise that instead of using it as a vehicle to help them
5545848 if they couldnt enhance it why didnt they release it anyway at the time when it was really fresh in peoples minds
5545849 the other thing is that very often someone is keeping a secret and that person may be a wife or a mother but putting that sort of pressure on 12 years ago could well have tipped somebody
5545850 twelve years on that person could be dead they could be divorced it really does beggar belief
5545851 it wouldnt have taken einstein to work out they were holding something like that
5545852 quarterback battle has got to clarify itself fairly soon so we can start to get some rhythm and consistency out there
5545853 i think perhaps she was shocked and didnt know what to say
5545854 shes representative of what happens to the patients we see
5545855 a lot of the patients we see think theyre going crazy
5545856 its appropriate for doctors to ask about stress the mistake is to assume thats what it is
5545857 their reactions made me feel like a whiner like i was making up all of these bizarre symptoms
5545858 she said i do believe theres something wrong with you but we dont know what it is
5545859 he said i didnt marry your ovaries i married you he has been there for me and all the doctors at nih have been great
5545860 i was in pain i had bad depression i was irritable i lost my mom when i was 3 and i worried that history was repeating itself
5545861 over half the women weve seen had seen over three different doctors before an fsh test was ordered
5545862 it takes some out of the box thinking in that 15 minute window
5545863 the health care community needs to be more aware of this
5545864 i need someone to help me with housing and food for the children we cant cope with this by ourselves
5545865 we already have three girls she wanted a boy i told her because of our standard of life three are enough we were barely coping with three children
5545866 she might be able to suckle twins but not this many
5545867 there were offers from people as far away as kuwait and from the health ministry but nothing yet
5545868 i dont think that they mean to treat you differently its just something that happens
5545869 we need to do a major education effort aimed at the public because the stigma with mental illness is clearly clearly out there
5545870 in some ways mental illness is the final frontier of socially acceptable discrimination
5545871 these figures show clearly the insidious stigma still associated with mental health and mental illness
5545872 these are the attitudes that have kept mental health on the outside for far too long
5545873 meanwhile less than half of canadians think people struggling with drug and alcohol addictions have a mental illness says the report
5545874 can make it difficult to walk up and down stairs or run hop jump or kick a ball
5545875 he clearly suffers from a mild form but the fact he shows no sign of it at all is a great tribute to his acting skills and makes him a role model for other people with this condition

5545877 learn three chords on the guitar and write a tune instead of ruining everyone elses

5545879 an entire generation of developing world youth would be removed from the cockpit of religious fundamentalism presuming they dont make the hideous mistake of moving to the american bible belt and would be exposed to the irresistible distractions of sex drugs and rocknroll they would be won over forever to the light side of the force the enlightenment liberalism atheism sexual permissiveness punk rock disco dancing ice cream real ale books puppy dogs and all that good stuff
5545880 in this market unless i have a reason to think a movie like this is going to be a slam dunk im not going to take a flyer on it even with heath ledger
5545881 when i am playing belle i have to play a sexually liberated empowered young prostitute but unfortunately i felt like a sweating sea cow
5545882 we wont rule it out but we are working on a christmas special now
5545883 everybody in this room could be donating to some other cause or to their own well being but i want to thank you
5545884 faced with the embarrassing prospect of holding a fundraiser with one of jack abramoffs closest associates the mccain campaign scrambled today to scratch ralph reed from tonights program but voters deserve to know the answers to the real questions raised by reeds involvement
5545885 if the mccain campaign wont return the money reed has raised for them then voters should rightly ask why it matters that reed didnt show up at tonights event the real question isnt why reed isnt showing up but why a so called reformer would invite him at all
5545886 before the obama campaign launches attacks they should stop and think about the amount of money that has been raised through convicted criminal and longtime fundraiser tony rezko
5545887 it takes a lot of audacity for obama and his spokespeople to criticize john mccain when obama was involved in a questionable home purchase with rezkos wife and years of friendship and dealings with a man convicted of wire and mail fraud money laundering and aiding and abetting bribery

5545889 this is a very young calf its probably two to three weeks old it absolutely needs its mother or another whale to adopt it
5545890 its heart wrenching normally whales stay very very close to their mothers theyre inseparable and they suckle for 11 months before being weaned
5545891 we managed to coax it out to sea yesterday by towing a yacht
5545892 the sad news is this morning its returned the last sighting was mackerel beach in pittwater
5545893 weve got some folks out there at the moment trying to assess its condition but the fact that it went out to sea yesterday there were whales in the vicinity but its come back in again its pretty sad news
5545894 it would suggest that its not been able to make contact with those whales or they werent interested in it
5545895 its probably a question of days rather than weeks its a very grim prognosis
5545896 from very early on dr nelson has sided with the spirits industry in opposing this measure
5545897 but from the early evidence that we have from the tax office this measure is being successful
5545898 dr nelson needs to explain what impact his opposition to this measure will have on the health of young people and on the sorts of outcomes that we are trying to achieve for the community in making sure that young people have a healthier approach in the way they consume alcohol
5545899 now mom they dont like americans here dont wear anything that gives you away as an american

5545904 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5545905 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5545906 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5545995 our focus continues to be talking to airlines either existing ones or those who do not serve oakland about opportunities here to expand or begin service
5545996 on top of that there is an overall sense that passengers who have some discretion whether they travel are becoming more price sensitive because of the economy
5545997 undermining all of this is the fact that the u s economy is simply not good right now and when people do not feel confident or economically secure they cut back on discretionary purchases travel dining out shopping or entertainment

5546046 ten years after college graduation i can clearly see two things that
5546047 i dont think it was that raging but its all a matter of perspective i guess
5546048 we very much regret the need to continue with this action but we must protect our patients from illness and not expose others to illness along with the impact on staffing levels in some areas
5546049 i think its really important as we look at tools to think about how we can support fact checking how can we guard against misinformation how is there going to be established an element of authority and trustworthiness i grew up with the newspaper and the encyclopedia which you could trust and now you have blogs which are held often as news and often arent factual or you have wikipedia which usually gets most things right but there are a lot times there is vandalism or corrections that need to be made
5546050 when you look at the elements of anonymity and the lack of accountability that happens on the web it really does start to create doubt in the fibers of who can you trust
5546051 well i think there are two ways to look at it on the institutional level and on the individual level so i think that what youre seeing is that there are institutions that are rising up online that basically have an element of brand and credibility and standards that they apply when you look at the huffington post the drudge report inherently the people who run those organizations are saying that here are stories i believe i believe theyre verified enough that im willing to attach my brand and my name to it so you can see that thats starting to happen on an institution level online
5546052 and i also think there are individual systems where people are verified or credentialed or you have a profile that tells all about you and shows the other contributions youve made to the system
5546053 well i think anonymity has its place so theres certainly times when you know you should have commentary or some type of act giving should be anonymous but by and large most systems should have accountability the same way they do in the physical world
5546054 like every other businesses that rely heavily on fuel we have no choice to increase our charges
5546055 the increasing fuel price is also having an impact on our services so we have to increase the fares to meet the fuel price and keep the business running
5546056 for us individual operators our fares range between 7 and 10 a kilometer in the past taxi fare from honiara international airport to town is 50 now its 70 he said
5546057 because of the high cost of fuel we could not afford to driver around the streets the whole day searching for passengers we just parked at a spot and wait for calls to come

5546088 lafaz sumpah itu betul mengikut ajaran islam tetapi tindakan memegang al quran dan berada dalam masjid tidak perlu dilakukan
5546089 sekiranya dia benar dia akan selamat tetapi jika dia berbohong lambat laun kelaknatan allah akan turun kepadanya dalam berbagai perkara yang tidak tergambar oleh dirinya sendiri
5546090 keberanian saiful melafazkan lafaz yang seperti itu menunjukkan samada dia meyakini apa yang dia dakwa ataupun dia tidak faham akan kesan terhadap lafaz berkenaan pada masa hadapan
5546091 bukan mudah seseorang melafazkan sumpah mubahalah itu melainkan dia dalam keadaan tidak siuman ataupun dia sedar apa yang diyakini itu benar
5546092 oleh kerana akan timbul kesangsian pihak yang di cabar dan untuk menghilangkan keraguan masyarakat maka pihak yang didakwa iaitu datuk seri anwar ibrahim hendaklah melafazkan sumpah bermubahalah dengan bentuk yang sama maka jadilah mubahalah yang mana kita akan lihat hukuman tuhan nanti

5546241 generally age based participation requirements should no longer apply mature age jobseekers should have standard job search requirements as long as they are receiving an activity test payment
5546242 its fine to say there is a pool of people available aged over 55 but you have to look at ways to transition them
5546243 many dont know where to go to get jobs and some have been knocked back and have lost confidence there has to be more thought around how it will work
5546244 often they are intimidated by the it capabilities of younger workers so you have to work out the best way to train them this could be in teams rather than leaving them alone in front of a pc
5546245 people running small and medium businesses havent got hr people or experts to provide them with insights into workforce issues they are traditionally so preoccupied with day to day tasks they dont get involved in strategy
5546246 you have got to get past the gate keepers many managers will give lip service to the idea of hiring over 55s but then think not on my shift for a start they wont be flexible with working arrangements many mature male managers are used to face to face cultures they think if i cant see them i cant trust them so employing over 55s is something that has to be taken up by the leaders of the company
5546247 there are a lot of employers in denial but it is going to get a lot worse one ceo said to me it was like the y2k bug a lot of bosses think it doesnt apply to them until an incident when someone is going to retire and needs to be replaced or a key staff member is poached and they have trouble replacing them even when they are aware of the issue they dont know what to do
5546248 by 2012 15 of the avaliable workforce will be aged under 45 years and 85 will be aged over 45 in australia if you dont have a strategy and understanding of the mature worker then your business will be compromised
5546249 we are seeing more women go back into the workforce once the children leave home and their husbands retire whats the saying women get half the money and double the husband
5546250 i dont think i can be expected to take seriously any game which takes less than three days to reach its conclusion
5546251 the occasional dullness and boredom is what makes it true to experience
5546252 full of theorists who can ruin your game in no time

5546274 gays shouldnt be kicked out of the military because they are nicer folks than criminals weve recruited lately but its fine to treat them worse than straight people in every other respect simply because of their sexual orientation
5546275 instead the military is firing badly needed capable troops simply because theyre gay and replacing them with a hodge podge that includes ex cons drug abusers and high school dropouts

5546277 the walls between the countries with the most and those with the least cannot stand these now are the walls we must tear down
5546278 greatest danger of all is to allow new walls to divide us one from the other
5546279 there is another wall that exists on the u s mexican border this wall is still under construction this wall is here must we ignore it

5546301 woodson was supposed to go in with about four minutes left
5546302 but we got the ball taken away from us when the fumble call was overturned we didnt want to put him in a two minute situation because he had not had a two minute situation in practice
5546303 i dont think that would have been fair to him or the other players tom coughlin made that decision and i agreed with him
5546304 i really dont get nervous for games i was getting really excited obviously just getting on the field being out there with the giants wearing a uniform it was dream come true to walk on the field and know you finally made it to the nfl
5546305 i was ready to go out there and show what i have but unfortunately things happened and i have to wait until this week
5546306 he is like a lot of young quarterbacks he has it all upstairs as far as what the plays are but he is still working on being able to pull it out
5546307 im very happy with his delivery he came into camp with a little hitch which has improved
5546308 no one ever told me about the hitch until i got to the scouting combine
5546309 were just trying to quicken up the motion a little where i hold the ball it is difficult because you have to think of so much stuff and then they want you to think of that too it takes a little time but eventually you get the swing of it
5546310 thats important for a young quarterback and you try to explain things so he understands them
5546311 i think i have a little bit more of a sense of the offense
5546312 obviously its different terminology a lot more difficult than college and right now im just trying to pick up the speed and the offense
5546313 im just focusing on what i need to be doing off the field so i can keep doing what i do on the field
5546314 i just have to be smart and handle myself like a professional at all times off the field if ill handle situations like im supposed to everything else will take care of itself
5546315 how do we get it done it has to be a people movement
5546316 in 78 days we will have different leadership we have been at a terrible impasse and we have lost our moral authority not just in the u s but in the world
5546317 i have travelled before but now i can take my time to look at all the nooks and crannies
5546318 its very sad because its the end of an era but things are also exciting
5546319 will soon so out number us that all the advantages we have will not in my opinion be able to preserve our language and even our government will become precarious
5546320 in the minds of many americans of influence and position at the time the post 1890 immigrants jews italians various slavic groups greeks were probably as foreign as hispanics are today and considered as hispanics are today as in some degree nonwhite
5546321 the process of assimilation is such that our views of the degree of difference of newer non white groups changes rapidly
5546322 so the jews and italians considered very foreign at the time of immigration by henry adams and others were much less foreign by the 30s hardly foreign at all by the 60s they were then as white as other whites for a time called white ethnics
5546323 even the notion of hispanics ranges in people of european origin in chile to those of native america origin in the lowlands of mexico
5546324 the original peoples of europe north africa or the middle east
5546325 who trace their origin or descent to mexico puerto rico cuba spanish speaking central and south america countries and other spanish cultures

5546337 no permitiremos que rusia dibuje una nueva l nea de separaci n en los estados que a n no est n integrados en la estructura transatl ntica como georgia y ucrania
5546338 tenemos que rechazar los objetivos estrat gicos de rusia que estaban claramente encaminados a socavar la democracia de georgia a usar su capacidad militar para da ar y en algunos casos destruir las infraestructuras y a debilitar el estado georgiano
5546339 rusia no puede tener las dos cosas no puede actuar como lo hizo en la guerra fr a y esperar que se le trate como un socio responsable al mismo tiempo
5546340 es un estado que desafortunadamente usa el instrumento que siempre ha utilizado que es la fuerza militar
5546341 si rusia quiere hacer una elecci n estrat gica diferente eso es un mal comienzo
5546342 esto es un juego muy peligroso y quiz los rusos quieren reconsiderarlo

5546352 singapore prime minister lee hsien loongs national day rally speech 2006
5546353 the lot is cast into the lap but the whole disposing thereof is of the lord
5546354 some trust in chariots and some in horses military might but we will remember the name of the lord our god
5546355 we will not force someone who has a family to give a statement we do not want to break up families for one mistake some guy made
5546356 the first thing thats striking is that we are concentrating less on whats going on in society i e the high demand for sexual services and more on what impact this case is going to have on cypriot families
5546357 if you look at the media coverage no ones talked about the possible sexual exploitation of these women we know there is a serious problem of sexual exploitation in cyprus yet its never been a question in the press they are more concerned about the exposure of the clients
5546358 in sweden demand for the sexual services of trafficked women is criminalised
5546359 there is tacit acceptance of it here if you open a newspaper youll see many adverts for massage parlours or new arrivals as if theyve just brought in the latest winter collection
5546360 in this case they criminalise the provider which is not a bad thing but the client is completely exonerated
5546361 its something natural a way of life like any job a builder knows how to build a good wall just like a prostitute knows how to satisfy her client sexually and like any job employees need employers to ensure customer satisfaction and protection
5546362 its a centuries old profession we shouldnt be making this a problem there are more important issues to worry about
5546363 but as workers these women should have better rights and more protection they are people too
5546364 otherwise it goes underground with pimps fighting each other over whos got the prettiest girls and more guns all for nothing if it was legal things would be different
5546365 neither men nor women take family seriously nowadays the only difference is women dont go with prostitutes they go with others
5546366 our times do not allow for these serious condemnations we have changed a lot very few people are stuck on old morals and principles
5546367 i preferred the first type i used to tell those who did it for a passport that they had better options than this i also disagreed with employers who forced girls to do things you cant achieve anything with a bad act and it always creates more problems than its worth
5546368 the authorities need to ensure better treatment of those girls
5546369 one can say the commercialisation of love and exploitation of women is something human society should not accept but at the same time i would have a hard time fighting the decision of any person prostitute to engage in this act
5546370 you need to strike a balance a person can have the individual right to offer sexual services but you dont have to make it an institutionalised right
5546371 the pimp you mentioned supposedly has liberal views on women but ask him to put his sister or mother on the market
5546372 it doesnt help if we put our heads in the sand this is hypocrisy its not easy to discuss these things but children are not traditional and conservative any more we have to face the fact
5546373 i cant even listen to that song the first time i heard it i was in total shock
5546374 it promotes homosexuality and its message is shameful and disgusting when it comes on the radio i bow my head and pray
5546375 she is our daughter and we love her and cant cut her out of our lives but we strongly disagree with how she is conducting herself and she knows how disappointed we are
5546376 the message she is promoting is about homosexuality which the bible clearly states is a sin
5546377 some of her outfits are too revealing and her father has had words with her about it she changed when she went to la and is going through a period of rebellion katy is not a homosexual and has just been led astray by hollywood
5546378 shes told me oh mom im not going to turn into amy winehouse but i pray all the time god will help her find salvation
5546379 oh the children for the love of the poor cute little children protect the children
5546380 with bisphenol a we already know so much about it its not likely that anyones going to do an experiment tomorrow that will render everything that we know today wrong

5546408 van grootaandeelhouders genieten we meer vertrouwen als we daar uitleggen we gaan het als volgt doen dan begrijpen we elkaar kleine aandeelhouders begrijpen het jargon niet altijd en denken vooral ai ik krijg dit jaar geen dividend en de koers is omlaag dus moeten we het extra uitleggen
5546409 ik ben zeer tevreden over deze premiere avond waarvan er nog meer zullen volgen ik denk dat hiermee een eerste stap is gezet naar het herwinnen van het vertrouwen dat ongetwijfeld hier en daar geschaad is
5546410 de avond verliep vrij goed beter dan we hadden verwacht maar veel hadden we al gehoord
5546411 het is een goede eerste stap maar het moet leiden tot een moment van verantwoording 2009 is daarvoor te laat we hebben nog andere vragen
5546412 het blijft ons doel om een buitengewone aandeelhoudersvergadering te organiseren uiteindelijk moeten aandeelhouders oordelen over zaken als vertrouwen we streven nog naar het halen van de 10 grens die zich moet aanmelden om een bava bijeen te roepen

5546415 please sire i would like to speak to the king
5546416 yes your majesty i want so much to attend the banquet but i have no royal robes to wear please sir if i may be so bold may i have one of your old garments so that i too may come to the banquet
5546417 take this man to your room and array him in some of your clothes
5546418 you are now eligible to attend the kings banquet tomorrow night
5546419 but even more important you will never need any other clothes these garments will last forever
5546420 i would not live forever because we should not live forever because if we were supposed to live forever then we would live forever but we cannot live forever which is why i would not live forever
5546421 whenever i watch tv and see those poor starving kids all over the world i cant help but cry i mean id love to be skinny like that but not with all those flies and death and stuff

5546425 that lowdown scoundrel deserves to be kicked to death by a jackass and im just the one to do it
5546426 it isnt pollution thats harming the environment its the impurities in our air and water that are doing it
5546427 weve got to pause and ask ourselves how much clean air do we need
5546428 we dont necessarily discriminate we simply exclude certain types of people

5546431 ive been hearing that im overworked but i havent felt that way
5546432 to say i was overworked that would be an excuse thats not at all legitimate
5546433 i had a rough stretch last year not as long as this one maybe but i got through it and im confident ill get through this were looking at a road trip thats going to be a big challenge and i want to get back to being a good pitcher for this team again

5546442 from very early on dr nelson has sided with the spirits industry in opposing this measure
5546443 but from the early evidence that we have from the tax office this measure is being successful
5546444 dr nelson needs to explain what impact his opposition to this measure will have on the health of young people and on the sorts of outcomes that we are trying to achieve for the community in making sure that young people have a healthier approach in the way they consume alcohol
5546445 dr nelson is taking i think a big risk by opposing a measure which could have a significant impact on the health of the next generation

5546450 president musharraf has been a friend to the united states and one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism president musharraf made the critical choice to join the fight against al qaida the taliban and other extremist groups that threaten the peace and security of pakistan its neighbors and partners throughout the world for this he has our deep gratitude we will continue to work with the pakistani government and political leaders and urge them to redouble their focus on pakistans future and its most urgent needs including stemming the growth of extremism addressing food and energy shortages and improving economic stability the united states will help with these efforts to see pakistan reach its goal of becoming a stable prosperous democratic modern muslim nation
5546451 musharrafs role was by the end of the day very ambivalent he was seen as the ally of the united states and a symbol of stability in the region but was he really such a symbol was he part of the problem or was he part of the solution
5546452 more and more observers came to the conclusion that musharraf himself was part of the problem therefore his resignation today signifies more confusion but it will not necessarily lead this part of the world into immediate chaos he was part of the problem and part of the problem is resigning today
5546453 unfortunately the vision one has of pakistan right now is an extremely negative one the future is very bleak the economic situation is confused the political situation is even more confused and the security situation is deteriorating so unfortunately it looks like a dark spot on the planet
5546454 these classical projections and something from the fire suddenly suggested poussins scene in which the seasons hand in hand and facing outward tread in rhythm to the notes of the lyre that the winged and naked greybeard plays the image of time brought thoughts of mortality of human beings facing outward like the seasons moving hand in hand in intricate measure stepping slowly methodically sometimes a trifle awkwardly in evolutions that take recognizable shape or breaking into seemingly meaningless gyrations while partners disappear only to reappear again once more giving pattern to the spectacle unable to control the melody unable perhaps to control the steps of the dance
5546455 sooner or later the administration would have fallen anyway for the same reasons that destroy all pakistani governments they cannot satisfy the demands of the masses for higher living standards if only because these are always devoured by population growth and they cannot satisfy the demand of the political elites for patronage because there is not enough to go round the state and the military cannot govern without the elites because there is no basis in ideology or society for the creation of a new mass political movement in the end elite and mass discontent unite in unstoppable protest

5546464 i am deeply honored and very excited by this opportunity to work with undergraduates and faculty from other parts of the university
5546465 asu faculty members from across the university are delighted to be tapped by barrett to do lectures and seminars and to mentor these students
5546466 the american law school historically has been far too cut off from the rest of the liberal arts university
5546467 accordingly as we create a new gold standard for public legal education at the sandra day oconnor college of law we seek to integrate undergraduate ph d and education about law and policy with the traditional law degree the colleges increasingly close relationship with barrett is a reflection of that commitment and i see myles as the perfect person to continue building these important bridges
5546468 professor lynk has been an invaluable supporter of barrett and we are delighted to have his intellectual focus with barrett this year

5546473 as we strive to get more students studying abroad in china and other parts of asia support such as that provided by the freeman foundation will be instrumental in making more opportunities available to all students

5546519 the work is rather too light and bright and sparkling it wants shade it wants to be stretched out here and there with a long chapter of sense if it could be had if not of solemn specious nonsense about something unconnected with the story an essay on writing a critique on walter scott or the history of buonapart or anything that would form a contrast and bring the reader with increased delight to the playfulness and general epigrammatism of the general style

5546538 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5546539 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5546540 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5546541 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5546542 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5546543 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5546544 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5546545 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5546546 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5546547 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5546548 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5546549 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5546550 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5546551 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5546552 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5546553 since the september 16 2007 incident we have said that based on statements of company personnel who were directly involved we believe those involved acted appropriately
5546554 if it is determined that an individual acted improperly blackwater would support holding that person accountable but at this stage without being able to review evidence collected in an ongoing investigation we will not prejudge the actions of any individual
5546555 if he made a decision to go or fight against it we didnt advise him either way
5546556 we really did keep our fingers out of this one
5546557 president musharraf has been a friend to the united states and one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism
5546558 we will continue to work with the pakistani government and political leaders and urge them to redouble their focus on pakistans future and its most urgent needs including stemming the growth of extremism addressing food and energy shortages and improving economic stability
5546559 the united states will help with these efforts to see pakistan reach its goal of becoming a stable prosperous democratic modern muslim nation
5546560 there is a great deal of frustration on the part of the u s government with pakistans inability to follow through on what the u s sees as its clear commitments
5546561 it remains very much to be seen whether this new democratically elected leadership will really be able to follow through in a sustained and coherent way
5546562 it could actually be setting the torch to the kindling inside the country
5546563 i dont want the people of pakistan to slide deeper and deeper into uncertainty
5546564 it puts a lot more responsibility squarely on the government there is no more excuse any more they have to stand up and do things they cant blame musharraf
5546565 i really dont think he has been a factor for six months
5546566 he hasnt been able to do that while he was in the presidency and he wont be as well positioned out of the presidency to interfere
5546567 strong pakistan that continues its efforts to strengthen democracy and fight terror
5546568 president bush looks forward to working with the government of pakistan on the economic political and security challenges they face
5546569 there are staff that are extraordinarily kind there are staff that are singling her out for special attention
5546570 theres nowhere she can go to be alone theres nowhere she can go to get peace
5546571 we feel shes well managed we havent heard about any outward threats by other prisoners we train our staff to treat all our prisoners equally
5546572 his skills really get magnified when surrounded by great players like this
5546573 the idea is that just as a snail lives inside its shell so our world is inside our house

5546575 there were nearly 30 000 naturalization cases submitted to the fbi before may of 2006 that were most likely recently resolved
5546576 this is one of the reasons we see a similar name to someone on a terrorist watch list
5546577 i think what happened to ahmed is simply that he applied for citizenship at a time when there were a lot of security concerns
5546578 i thought oh my god i bet they think my client is this guy
5546579 it means good news like if your wife is pregnant and has a baby you say warsame good news

5546582 i dont need the big old stuffy chairs the big reception counter at the front and id much rather meet him at starbucks than anything else
5546583 its good to see my money go to actual legal work versus big legal offices
5546584 the billable hours system isnt satisfying because you do what you can count
5546585 its demoralizing and can misalign you with your client and really makes you more inefficient its about how you can make the practice scalable but you have to be willing to take risks

5546624 sadly there is no har in immanion who would believe any of this
5546625 over the years there have been a lot of things i have asked you to do a lot of promises i asked you to make
5546626 there is one promise i should never have asked you to make and i am going to ask you to break it unmake it if you will when i met you i asked you to exchange your life for your familys lives and offered protection in exchange for the promise that you would not seek them out i am asking you to unmake that promise
5546627 things are changing in megalithica i can no longer protect them without their knowledge and cooperation your brother is a well respected man in the human communities in the barren lands he however is not trusting of wraeththu he believes you to have been slaughtered with the mob in the stadium we are hoping that your making contact will facilitate the negotiations
5546628 ketio hes my brother a homecoming would be awkward with an armed hara along for the ride ill be alright promise
5546629 easy for you to say its us tharmifex has threatened with dire consequences if so much as a hair on your head is harmed
5546630 youre alive youre alive youre alive youre alive youre alive
5546631 they slaughtered trumble and all those people in the stadium they took you youre asking us to trust them
5546632 im asking you to trust those i have trusted and who have kept their word to me all these years by protecting you
5546633 but you had to exchange your life for ours to gain that protection
5546634 in recent years their numbers have swelled with those fleeing the varr and the uigenna among others they understand what might happen if those tribes become interested in their northern refuge
5546635 but either way your initial contacts with the nomadic hara have been encouraging
5546636 we have had only limited contact with wraeththu since coming to these lands
5546637 understand that not all of us have pleasant memories of your kind
5546638 you do know how much i love you dont you

5546766 i was told tuesday night they suspected something i got the news saturday morning todd told me he kept me out of the loop for my protection
5546767 three years ago he did the exact same thing he grew out of his relationship to his wife and transferred his affection to another thats the biggest frustration with us the bottom line is that he was traveling too much and not taking care of his wife and family like he should

5546773 certainly now what we want to see in pakistan is a period of political stability to enable the government and the parliament of pakistan to address the serious issues that pakistan faces including security issues mr smith told abc radio today
5546774 they have very direct consequences for the nearly thousand troops that we have in afghanistan abutting the afghanistan pakistan border
5546775 up its dialogue with pakistan to provide any further assistance to help achieve regional control over terrorist groups
5546776 were obviously not talking about the use of military forces or combat troops but we stand ready willing and able to render the pakistani government whatever assistance we can to help it he said
5546777 will be a powerful tool that leverages the eyes and ears of many toward the apprehension of criminals who threaten our protectors

5546786 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
5546787 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
5546788 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
5546789 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
5546790 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5546791 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5546792 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5546793 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5546794 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5546795 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5546796 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5546797 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5546798 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5546799 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5546800 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5546801 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5546802 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5546803 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5546804 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5546805 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5546806 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5546807 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5546808 invocando la protecci n de dios fuente de toda raz n y justicia
5546809 y as pa no morir de hambre buscaban los animales de los men ndez por eso los mataba men ndez
5546810 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer
5546811 despu s de veinti n a os de explotarla trajeron unos pocos indios ac pero onas no vinieron m s que tres mujeres la paula la raquel y la petronila fueron las nicas que vinieron ac hombres no vino ninguno
5546812 detritus de la sociedad seres sin escr pulos y sin entra as que en pos del dinero y de la fortuna ca an en punta arenas atra dos por la f cil impunidad
5546813 sangre del gaucho y del indio s lo sirve para abonar la tierra
5546814 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
5546815 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
5546816 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
5546817 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
5546818 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5546819 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
5546820 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
5546821 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
5546822 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
5546823 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
5546824 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
5546825 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
5546826 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5546827 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5546828 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5546829 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5546830 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5546831 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5546832 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5546833 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5546834 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5546835 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
5546836 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
5546837 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5546838 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5546839 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5546840 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5546841 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5546842 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5546843 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5546844 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5546845 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5546846 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
5546847 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as
5546848 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto
5546849 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5546850 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
5546851 are you ready to make thousands of dollars every week working less than one hour per day

5546856 she was phoned up and informed this is a massive blow for her
5546857 the juror who stays out has a different opinion to the majority is often doing it for fairly rational reasons
5546858 its not the sort of irrational stupid juror which maybe the stereotype presents
5546859 theres a greater risk of a wrongful conviction if you have a chance of someone being convicted by an 11 to one vote than there is on a 12 nil vote
5546860 we say how can a verdict possibly be beyond reasonable doubt if one juror simply doesnt agree
5546861 we say that majority verdicts arent healthy and they just encourage compromise
5546862 thats not a proper way to run a jury system
5546863 it does in fact bring us in line with the rest of australia
5546864 these amendments were considered by cabinet in the context of recent debate about jury trials
5546865 thereve been a couple of cases where this issue has been the subject of public debate cabinet is part of that debate but these amendments have not been designed with any particular trial in mind
5546866 in controversial trials the only way to deal with recent problems is to allow questioning of jurors
5546867 we support judge only trials subject to seeing the fine print
5546868 but if the judge only trial is being brought in to deal with recent incidents of controversial figures and media excessive publicity we reject it for that reason
5546869 as long as the proposed legislation is confined to exceptional cases so that theres as little erosion of the role of juries as possible it could achieve a worthwhile goal to avoid having to make a choice between running the risk of a person not receiving a fair trial and losing the important opportunity of having serious criminal charges determined
5546870 we need to make sure that the detail is correct and that there wont be any surprises in there
5546871 we had the chief justice last year calling for a review of the justice system and we certainly think its timely

5546878 obama was caught red handed in his attempt to deceive the american people when nrlc released these official documents
5546879 i have said repeatedly that i would have been completely in fully in support of the federal bill that everybody supported which was to say that you should provide assistance to any infant that was born even if it was as a consequence of an induced abortion that was not the bill that was presented at the state level what that bill also was doing was trying to undermine roe v wade
5546880 so for people to suggest that i somehow in favor of withholding life saving support from an infant born alive is ridiculous it defies commonsense and it defies imagination and for people to keep on pushing this is offensive and its an example of the kind of politics we have to get beyond its one thing for people to disagree with me about the issue of choice its another thing for people to out and out misrepresent my positions repeatedly even after they know that theyre wrong
5546881 we now challenge obama to either declare the two 2003 documents to be forgeries and call for an official investigation or else apologize for his four years of misrepresentation on the issue of babies who are born alive during abortions and forcalling us liars
5546882 if you counted all the tennis courts in china there are probably fewer than in new york state alone

5546888 the willingness to put young people and their families in jeopardy thats what brought us to the conclusion to release the picture
5546889 its amazing how helpful field interviews are in solving serious crimes
5546890 sometimes officers say let me see your tattoos theyre kind of proud to show them to you which ultimately in some cases works against them in the end

5546895 it may be typical of the pro obama dungeons amp dragons crowd to disparage a fellow countrymans memory of war from the comfort of moms basement but most americans have the humility and gratitude to respect and learn from the memories of men who suffered on behalf of others

5546912 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
5546913 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
5546914 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender

5546926 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5546927 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5546928 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5546929 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5546930 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5546931 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5546932 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5546933 we have to deny russian strategic objectives which are clearly to undermine georgias democracy to use its military capability to damage and to weaken the georgian state
5546934 you can dance you can jive having the time of your life
5546935 as this series progresses i find myself less and less interested
5546936 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
5546937 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
5546938 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
5546939 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
5546940 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5546941 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5546942 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5546943 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5546944 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5546945 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5546946 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5546947 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5546948 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5546949 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5546950 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5546951 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5546952 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5546953 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5546954 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5546955 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5546956 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5546957 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5546958 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5546959 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5546960 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5546961 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5546962 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5546963 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5546964 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5546965 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5546966 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5546967 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5546968 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5546969 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5546970 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5546971 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5546972 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
5546973 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
5546974 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
5546975 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
5546976 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
5546977 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5546978 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5546979 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5546980 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
5546981 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
5546982 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5546983 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5546984 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5546985 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5546986 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5546987 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5546988 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5546989 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5546990 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5546991 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5546992 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5546993 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5546994 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5546995 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5546996 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5546997 this is a planning took where all things are going
5546998 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5546999 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5547000 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5547001 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5547002 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5547003 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5547004 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5547005 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5547006 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5547007 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5547008 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5547009 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5547010 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5547011 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5547012 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5547013 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5547014 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5547015 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5547016 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5547017 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5547018 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5547019 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5547020 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5547021 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5547022 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5547023 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5547024 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5547025 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5547026 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5547027 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5547028 we have less time to get mentally ready for the game with xs and os and adjustments
5547029 weve just got to make the best of our practice time be very organized and structured and have a mission about getting this done thats my focus as our staff and our team this week were going to pick up the intensity and it has to be important to everybody that we are getting after it in practice
5547030 a lot of it was we practiced against a 4 3 and they walked up in a 50 and there was a couple of missed assignments here and there
5547031 just like i said its never as bad as you think it is and its never as good as you think it is we just have a couple of personnel changes that were going to look at were just going to shore up some of our stuff and get ready for buchtel
5547032 every week coaches come in and game plan for a team and theres adjustments
5547033 were pretty inexperienced at a lot of spots that doesnt mean not talented but were inexperienced with experience you start grasping that change thats always occurring on the field during the game
5547034 so from a defensive standpoint you dont really get a good look at whats their true strength or weakness what is their go to stuff

5547036 the biggest event of the summer was the summer league for me
5547037 touted himself as a member of mccains victory 2008 team in an e mail that solicited donations on mccains behalf
5547038 so who are using these services a high ranking amazon executive told me there are 60 000 different customers across the various amazon web services and most of them are not the startups that are normally associated with on demand computing rather the biggest customers in both number and amount of computing resources consumed are divisions of banks pharmaceuticals companies and other large corporations who try aws once for a temporary project and then get hooked
5547039 im proud of the growth weve seen in our first year with a remarkable number of visitors registering as users early tests of this new site design show a double digit growth in that conversion rate helping us meet our goal of getting 1 million americans on track to meet their financial goals by 2010

5547069 both of the guys have a lot of strengths theyre both hard working young men and put a lot of time into it i want to make sure they understand the reasoning why the other thing is theyre going to be a big part of our offensive scheme no matter who the quarterback is
5547070 if you look at it both quarterbacks threw the ball pretty well they didnt make a lot of bad throws even the picked ball was a tipped ball that should have been caught i thought both quarterbacks did a good job of reading their keys they didnt throw the stupid ball they ran and tried to get yards scrambling instead of forcing a turnover or a bad ball

5547082 most working families today do not have homes that have anywhere near ten rooms john mccain has ten houses many working people in america have to work two and three jobs to provide for their families and pay their car loans john mccain hops on a private jet is it any wonder why mccain champions a george bush agenda of cutting taxes for corporations and the wealthy helping oil companies turn record profits and leaving working families to fend for themselves mccains velvet world leaves him utterly unprepared to make the tough choices we need to restore the middle class and ensure that everyone in america has quality affordable health insurance
5547083 the public doesnt know who on earth john mccain is

5547291 the worst thing the world could do would be to compromise and show weakness

5547296 clear expectations that the fed will cut once again next week and keep cutting until some further signs of progress emerge continue to fuel the precious metals
5547297 an important resistance area at and around 900 was being probed this morning and was successfully accomplished
5547298 given the turmoil across the financial markets its not surprising to see the precious metals remain extremely volatile as some investors cash in their positions to generate cash while others will look favorably upon gold as a safe haven asset
5547299 despite an onslaught of bearish forecasts and attempts to cap the market gold continues to demonstrate it remains in a secular bull market 1 000 is not a question of if but when
5547300 to provoke the further effusion of blood and i have arranged to meet with general grant with a view to surrender
5547301 probability is very high that the bull market top arrived in october 2007 and that we are now in a bear market that will continue for another year or more possibly until mid 2010 until we have evidence to the contrary remember that bear market rules apply the next thing to expect is a reaction rally back toward the recently violated neckline support which is now overhead resistance

5547336 were not finding enough oxygen to support life aquatic life
5547337 this green line is the oxygen right here and at the bottom its reading less than 2 milligrams per liter
5547338 theres no oxygen in the water for shrimp crabs fish to live
5547339 can sense that and they start to move out of the area otherwise they would die the animals that still remain in the sediments have to keep breathing there is not enough oxygen and eventually they will die off
5547340 thats the primary source of the nutrients that go to the gulf of mexico
5547341 and so the size of the low oxygen zone has increased in proportion to these nutrients reaching the gulf
5547342 so these things will fall to the bottom and as they decompose they consume oxygen

5547353 these forums illustrate how sophisticated intellectual practices to improve game play mimic actual scientific reasoning
5547354 gamers are openly discussing their strategies and thinking creating an environment in which informal scientific reasoning practices are being learned by playing these online video games
5547355 the big picture is that there are several dimensions on which games have effects
5547356 dimensions include the amount they are played the content of each game what you have to pay attention to on the screen and how you control the motions
5547357 this means that games are not good or bad but are powerful educational tools and have many effects we might not have expected they could
5547358 animators and game designers have a good idea of natural motion but for ux designers this is a real challenge
5547359 we have to learn how to use that motion effectively motion is a really powerful tool we can use as designers but the real art is using it judiciously by finding the appropriate amount of real world physics and applying them on the screen
5547360 silverlight expression studio and the windows presentation foundation really throw this challenge out to designers
5547361 silverlight 1 was all about play pause stop video experiences whereas silverlight 2 is about representing and surfacing complex data
5547362 silverlight 2 provides opportunities to display rich data in deep and meaningful ways it really comes into its own by providing a way to collapse and coalesce the amount of data collected by rfid quickly and in different ways
5547363 we have to see what we can pull off in the next few weeks

5547384 since my pictures are large colorful and unframed and since museum walls are usually immense and formidable there is the danger that the pictures relate themselves as decorative areas to the walls this would be a distortion of their meaning since the pictures are intimate and intense and are the opposite of what is decorative

5547390 we officially passed final cert on our first try friday august 15th
5547391 a great deal still depends on the decisions and good judgment of the next president the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5547392 we won a massive victory in a few weeks and we did so with very limited loss of american and allied lives we were able to end aggression with minimum overall loss of life and we were even able to greatly reduce the civilian casualties of afghani and iraqi citizens
5547393 well then why was there a banner that said mission accomplished on the aircraft carrier look i have said a long time that reconstruction of iraq would be a long long difficult process but the conflict the major conflict is over the regime change has been accomplished and its very appropriate
5547394 senator obama commits the greater error of insisting that even in hindsight he would oppose the surge even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5547395 i suppose from my opponents vantage point veterans concerns are just one more issue to be spun or worked to advantage
5547396 what i have found in the last five to ten years is that students are writing characters of other ethnicities without even thinking twice about it a white student will write an asian character or a black character they dont even think its challenging its just part of their world this is a big change bigger than even the theater world i think and very interesting

5547399 obama was caught red handed in his attempt to deceive the american people when nrlc released these official documents
5547400 i have said repeatedly that i would have been completely in fully in support of the federal bill that everybody supported which was to say that you should provide assistance to any infant that was born even if it was as a consequence of an induced abortion that was not the bill that was presented at the state level what that bill also was doing was trying to undermine roe v wade
5547401 so for people to suggest that i somehow in favor of withholding life saving support from an infant born alive is ridiculous it defies commonsense and it defies imagination and for people to keep on pushing this is offensive and its an example of the kind of politics we have to get beyond its one thing for people to disagree with me about the issue of choice its another thing for people to out and out misrepresent my positions repeatedly even after they know that theyre wrong
5547402 we now challenge obama to either declare the two 2003 documents to be forgeries and call for an official investigation or else apologize for his four years of misrepresentation on the issue of babies who are born alive during abortions and forcalling us liars

5547431 there is one thing we do on earth that we will continue to do in heaven that is to praise and worship god that is why we view life on earth for those who live jesus as choir practise for heaven to say that praise and worship is the most important category of music is an understatement in light of that fact there is no more important activity of the human heart that to praise and worship god

5547468 too many people want to look like celebrities who are perfectly tanned but their skin is good because they spend thousands on holidays and treatments not a pound a time in the salons
5547469 we want to provide young people with a shocking visual representation of how sunbeds and over exposure to the sun can dramatically affect the way you look further down the line

5547475 have been posed and resolved so clearly and one could almost say so logically that in comparison other mysticisms appear incomplete fragmentary and inconclusive and that as opposed to any obtrusive emotional and sentimental element a style of intellectual clarity rigour and objectivity predominates which reminds one of the modern scientific mentality
5547476 just as a practised turner or turners apprentice when turning quickly knows i am turning quickly and when turning slowly knows i am turning slowly
5547477 as a practised butcher or butchers apprentice who butchers a cow takes it to the market place and dissects it piece by piece he knows these parts he looks at them and examines them well and then sits down
5547478 this path through consciousness and awakening is as clearly described as a road on an accurate map along which every tree every bridge and every house is marked
5547479 and he reaches the admirable path discovered by the intensity the constancy and the concentration of the will the admirable path discovered by the intensity the constancy and the concentration of the energy the admirable path discovered by the intensity the constancy and the concentration of the soul the admirable path discovered by the intensity the constancy and the concentration of the investigation with a heroic spirit as the fifth
5547480 and thus attaining these fifteen heroic qualities he is able o disciples to achieve liberation to achieve awakening to attain the incomparable sureness
5547481 developed and often practised leads to two fold health health in the present and health in the future
5547482 for the wise man the expert not for the ignorant the inexpert
5547483 as kusa grass when wrongly grasped cuts the hand so the ascetic life wrongly practised leads to infernal torments
5547484 as a man who wants serpents goes out for serpents looks for serpents and finding a powerful serpent grasps it by the body or by the tail and the serpent striking at him bites his hand or arm or other part so that he suffers death or mortal anguish and why is this because he wrongly grasped the serpent so there are men who are harmed by the doctrines and why is this because they wrongly grasped the doctrines
5547485 perhaps you may wish disciples thus knowing thus understanding to return for your salvation to the rites and the fantasies of the ordinary penitent or priest
5547486 is it thus then disciples that you speak only of that on which you yourselves have meditated which you yourselves have known which you yourselves have understood
5547487 this is well disciples remain then endowed with this doctrine which is visible in this life timeless inviting leading onward intelligible to all intelligent men if this has been said for this reason has it been said
5547488 there are penitents and priests who exalt liberation they speak in various manners glorifying liberation but as for that which concerns the most noble the highest liberation i know that none equals me let alone that i may be surpassed
5547489 of the many books published in italy and germany by j
5547490 the real significance of the book however lies not in its value as a weapon in a dusty battle between scholars but in its encouragement of a practical application of the doctrine it discusses
5547491 i have just received a letter from london it is from a man who has read my translation of evolas book the doctrine of awakening which however i cannot now recommend to you without considerable reservations since he seems to have a certain liking for samatha bh van i encouraged him to go on with it i think it will do him more good than harm and it is an excellent way of occupying the later years of his life he is now past sixty i think how many people promise themselves that they will spend their retirements profitably and then find that it is too late to start something new

5547498 as the officers were in the lower apartment one of the detectives reviewed the search warrant application and realized it was for the upper apartment
5547499 it appears to be an honest mistake and we certainly apologize to all involved
5547500 we can say comfortably that over 1 100 search warrants were executed last year and 580 to date this year and that with such a high volume and such a fast paced environment it is understandable that mistakes could happen
5547501 the way they make it seem is we can do whatever we want

5547511 this is a very young calf its probably two to three weeks old it absolutely needs its mother or another whale to adopt it
5547512 its heart wrenching normally whales stay very very close to their mothers theyre inseparable and they suckle for 11 months before being weaned
5547513 we managed to coax it out to sea yesterday by towing a yacht
5547514 the sad news is this morning its returned the last sighting was mackerel beach in pittwater
5547515 weve got some folks out there at the moment trying to assess its condition but the fact that it went out to sea yesterday there were whales in the vicinity but its come back in again its pretty sad news
5547516 it would suggest that its not been able to make contact with those whales or they werent interested in it
5547517 its probably a question of days rather than weeks its a very grim prognosis
5547518 if a lactating female with a calf goes past and this calf approaches that animal it may accept it but its a very slim chance
5547519 this is a very young calf its probably two to three weeks old it absolutely needs its mother or another whale to adopt it
5547520 its heart wrenching normally whales stay very very close to their mothers theyre inseparable and they suckle for 11 months before being weaned
5547521 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5547522 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5547523 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5547524 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5547525 i am sorry for that disruption we cannot proceed with the meeting without matsuuras party we will continue with this meeting as soon as it is most convinient to all again i am deeply sorry
5547526 we will i just had a link set up in my office before the meeting we will meet up with ken there
5547527 im asking you what the hell is wrong with you old goat you think you own this place
5547528 dont think you can just barge into meetings like that old man this isnt a yoshizawa office
5547529 tell him go ahead see if i care if you want ill call him myself
5547530 oi yeah its me dont get all mushy with me i have no plans of speaking to you really your friends here i think he wants to tell on me
5547531 fujimoto yes its me im at matsuuras your daughter here threw her phone at me what do i plan to do about it i had her call you so you can do something about it what hitomi didnt tell me what damn
5547532 shall award the cost of suit including a reasonable attorneys fee
5547533 against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the federal antitrust laws
5547534 would deter private enforcement of the federal antitrust laws by encouraging entities such as wbwwa to vigorously defend anti competitive state laws with little fear of fee liability and leading potential plaintiffs to feel less confident of success because of the increased likelihood of intervention from sometimes powerful third parties
5547535 if you were to remove all of the federal prisoners youre essentially creating an operating funding hole and every federal prisoner you kick out youre not going to replace with a city of little rock prisoner
5547536 i think we clearly need to go and advocate to the state the reimbursement rate needs to be raised to give the county some extra money
5547537 the state has quite a bit of reserve set aside additional money there that would help the counties quite a bit
5547538 we believe that what that statute means is that what the sheriff as the custodian administrator of the county jail has a certain amount of discretion
5547539 probably the state if every county and every jail brought every prisoner that was sick to uams it would bankrupt uams it would flood the hospitals and its just not a practical solution

5547555 on top of being the world champ at 155 pounds hes also been my hero

5547560 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5547561 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5547562 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5547563 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5547564 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5547565 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5547566 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5547567 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5547568 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5547569 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5547570 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5547571 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5547572 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5547573 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5547574 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5547575 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5547576 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5547577 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5547578 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5547579 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5547580 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5547581 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
5547582 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5547583 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

5547585 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5547586 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5547587 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5547588 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5547589 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5547590 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5547591 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5547592 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5547593 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5547594 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5547595 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5547596 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5547597 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5547598 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5547599 its been over a month now since you tried out awayfind just curious if i can help at all with ideas like how i use it in my email signature or tips i want to make an impact with this maybe even help you personally so if you have any insight to share about your experience im guessing youre not using it now from the stats

5547605 eurasia on the move the regional implications of mass labor migration from central asia to russia
5547606 cheap labor is filling a void inside russia itself the whole of the lower paying sectors in the russian economy are increasingly being filled by migrants from elsewhere in the cis
5547607 russias biggest contribution to the security of this very vulnerable region over the past decade has not been through its military presence or security pacts but has been specifically through absorbing the surplus labor from the caucasus and central asian states providing markets for their goods and transferring funds in the form of remittances
5547608 when it comes to attracting labour migrants it is always better to give the priority to those countries with which russia has good relations including trading and economic relations where there is a positive attitude
5547609 a disastrous political miscalculation even in an era that is increasingly defined by spectacularly poor judgement

5547625 we were the underdog in every game we played through the playoffs last year no one thought we were going to win those games and we went out and won them
5547626 were still the underdog that doesnt upset us we dont mind going under the radar a little bit were still the super bowl champions
5547627 i think we do have a chip on our shoulder you read the papers we had no chance in the nfc
5547628 if you need motivation at this level you dont need to be here
5547629 if you cant hype yourself up when you walk out into a stadium and see 85 000 screaming fans theres something wrong with you
5547630 its good to write about and players love to talk about us against the world and we played that role well it worked for us if it helps players get a little chip on their shoulder im ok with it it the super bowl is in the books for me whether it was a fluke or what its in the books
5547631 at the end of 06 it was the same basic formula fire the coach get rid of the quarterback fire all the players we go 0 2 and its fire the coach fire the quarterback get rid of the players you just hang in there

5547641 i dont feel differently maybe someone from the outside could say something different but i dont feel ive changed
5547642 im still a humble person i still look forward to practice i still get upset when we have bad plays i still prepare the same way from a football standpoint im doing the same things and preparing to get better

5547647 one who waits for something good never waits too long
5547648 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5547649 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5547650 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5547651 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

5547677 last year people were writing me off didnt think id last three games
5547678 to be where i am is quite an honor and im just thankful
5547679 i had to find the right school for me just because my dad played there didnt mean it was the right school for me
5547680 its night and day the difference this time last year to now
5547681 i always had confidence in myself i have lot more confidence than last year i always had confidence in my ability i just wanted to show clemson fans and rest of the country what i can do
5547682 i think cullen harper can be a better quarterback but not as productive statistically because of the offensive line
5547683 opening up with an opponent like alabama grabs your attention right away
5547684 its time for clemson to step up and solidify ourselves as a top team in the country time for acc to step up and play an sec team
5547685 its good exposure for clemson when i signed on the intent was to play in the acc championship game the time is now
5547686 i didnt pay attention to what people were saying good or bad when people said i wouldnt last be the starting qb and i didnt listen to them im not going to worry about this year and all the accolades my dad always reminds me to keep blinders on dont get distracted stay in the now dont look back dont look forward

5547693 its unbelievable that the chinese communist party is still in power after all the autrocites against their own people during the great leap forward the cultural revolution and the tian amen massacre
5547694 the chinese government is using the olympics for their own politics in order to strengthen their popular support
5547695 the board is please with the earnings growth achieved by the company this year and particularly in light of the price increases associated with steel and fuel which has given the company an opportunity to address its contractual terms going forward by including relevant rise and fall conditions
5547696 during the last 12 months the company has also expended a considerable amount of time and effort in finalising the companys strategic plan for its next phase of growth
5547697 this plan will see nomad further diversify and continue to expand its revenue and market base
5547698 the company currently has around 75 per cent of this forecast fy2009 revenue underpinned by existing contracts
5547699 the pipeline for future works and projects remains at all time high levels
5547700 it just doesnt seem to be fair that this is how we react but that is what we seem to be doing
5547701 mr holstein you may want to read the news release for the july board meeting you can do this as follows
5547702 people often use the excuse that their lives are uneventful
5547703 its also used to treat other conditions that are mediated by high adrenaline levels such as tremor and performance anxiety beta blockers dont lower the anxiety level but they lower manifestations of the anxiety such as fast heart rate sweating and tremor
5547704 this beta blocking agent is banned only in certain sports such as shooting and archery which require great control therefore i can only describe it the drug taking as deliberate
5547705 olympic pistol shooter used anti trembling drug to steady his hands
5547706 its the point in the season where youre going bad and youre falling out of it
5547707 youve really got to bear down and take some pride we had a couple games this homestand that were pretty embarrassing
5547708 we just feel very confident when he takes the mound
5547709 hes throwing strikes velocity is good hes mixing his pitches hes just having a tremendous second half
5547710 i like jo jo but dang there comes a time when youve got to be in charge on the mound
5547711 believed that freedom to think as you will and to speak as you think are means indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth that without free speech discussion would be futile
5547712 the premise that money matters to ladies is correct but the theory fails to consider that many females arent looking for chump change theyre looking for a chump to gold dig in order to find that guy with a large bank account or upward mobility ladies need to go to where the boys are especially in new york city were the ratio of guys to females is 9 to 10 ladies figure that more guys will go to a club where the admission price for guys is less and follow the boys there
5547713 the ladies who party at nightclubs however are a different story they belong to a group that controls over 50 of the nations wealth and makes 80 of the purchases
5547714 the only matter unworthy of serious attention in this lawsuit is the defense attorneys advocating that guys should financially subsidize females to party
5547715 if aer reverses the price for guys and ladies charges ladies what it does guys and guys what it charges ladies the plaintiff class will settle sounds fair after all if the price now charged men is not so burdensome then by charging it to females instead it shouldnt be burdensome either
5547716 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5547717 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5547718 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5547719 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5547720 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5547721 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5547722 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5547723 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5547724 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5547725 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5547726 its a classic case of rage of hate for someone its very personal
5547727 around november or december 2007 a man came into the office he was crying and his arms were bruised seeking assistance
5547728 took him into her office then to my amazement i heard her tell him that another way doesnt provide services or assistance for men my heart went out to this man because it was evident that he was truly a victim of domestic violence
5547729 this is discrimination and violating mens rights there are men with children that are being victimized it takes courage for men to come forward and admit they are victims then when they do we revictimize them all over again
5547730 we have limited resources and its all we can do to try and keep up with the demand for services for women and children
5547731 in all of that time there was one woman admitted who i was sure had been severely physically abused the rest of the women and kids who came and went were playing the system to the hilt

5547751 if you commute to work using one of the new synchronized routes which will be parishwide the average driver will save 14 52 per month just on the drive to and from work

5547755 we are delighted that we are involved with utimaco as a reseller but we are limited in what we can say because it is a pre offer
5547756 we cant make any comment at this stage other than what we have gone public with we cant make any predictions about the future because that could affect the share pricing and utimaco is a publically listed company on the german stock exchange
5547757 information security should be as commonplace as anti virus protection no longer a nice to have but a must have companies of all sizes are looking to protect against both external and internal threats with one manageable solution

5547763 the russians have to keep their promises this is a never ending story and there is not a single sign that they will begin the withdrawal as they said they would
5547764 we are here to keep peace between the two sides
5547765 meanwhile they are being well treated and well fed and given medical care
5547766 were just going to ride it out go home and drink some beer and enjoy ourselves
5547767 ive seen as many people die in blob shaped storms
5547768 this system is dangerous because people dont do common sense things
5547769 the impact is very low we have minimal damage as of now
5547770 ive still got a rather lengthy amount of time before i decide anything
5547771 the pendulum is swinging very heavily in the direction of it just being over ive never sat around and not gotten ready to head to florida well not in 23 or so years anyway so to me that will likely be the last real test for me and whether or not i want to put the time and effort into getting after it one more time
5547772 next i started thinking about the original plan of pitching the 2nd half of next season thing is that urgency just is not there i miss some things i didnt think i would and dont miss many things
5547773 its an up and coming school and program i feel real comfortable there and i think i fit in well

5547779 both camps lsu and georgia were great they were both very competitive i also liked the cities coaches and atmosphere of uga and lsu this is going to be a hard decision
5547780 its a regime started about six weeks ago its like 6 or 7 different products my skin has never looked or felt so good in all my adult life
5547781 jesus you wouldnt believe how much im spending on this shit its crazy but the results speak for themselves
5547782 ive got a girl that i go to see once a week she checks my progress and advises me on what products i should add or stop using she cant believe how far my skin has come in just six weeks
5547783 im tellin you the shit is worth its weight in gold which is good since thats what im paying for it

5547788 i vaguely recall that story being told among other stories
5547789 its being treated like every other proposed project in the city
5547790 thats going to be really detrimental to los angeles because we pump in hundreds of millions of dollars here
5547791 i mean were talking about planting trees and donating t shirts for kids
5547792 at this point there is no way any diesel truck industrial warehouse is going to do any good in that community

5547799 we tried a half dozen times to open up the taxi industry while i was in office
5547800 this outmoded law is a holdover from the great depression that serves solely to shut competitors out of the market theres absolutely no compelling reason to have this system in place
5547801 the legislature has provided the puc with a golden opportunity to implement much needed reforms in the denver taxi market which will benefit numerous aspiring entrepreneurs as well as countless taxi customers
5547802 the current system of letting existing taxi companies determine whether new taxi companies can open makes no more sense than asking burger king whether a town needs a new mcdonalds

5547810 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5547811 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5547812 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5547813 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5547814 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5547815 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5547816 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5547817 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5547818 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5547819 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5547820 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5547821 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5547822 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5547823 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

5547835 the real truth about the lisbon treaty ireland fought for its independence for long enough against one empire and now we are being asked if not intimidated to give this up to the control of a european empire its called a treaty because by calling it a constitution this would mean consulting with all the peoples of europe which the e u in its indifference to the opinions and feelings of all europeans dont want is ireland really a better place now as a result of e u intervention

5547860 this may help explain why children in numerate cultures with developmental dyscalculia find it so difficult to learn arithmetic

5547878 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5547879 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5547880 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5547881 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5547882 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5547883 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5547884 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

5547917 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5547918 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies

5547920 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5547921 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5547922 key drivers for the rest of our business namely capacity demand and the cost of fuel remain highly volatile

5547925 with fuel costs at never before seen record highs for much of the year and airlines around the world struggling to cope this result is a testament to our team and business model
5547926 we have implemented a range of measures in recent months to mitigate the impact of increased fuel costs
5547927 we will continue to closely monitor the operating environment and take whatever actions are necessary to see our way through what is expected to be a challenging period

5547944 to be the motivating factor of this controversy because of the result in the last election wherein his son niel tupas jr jun jun got many zeros in the many precincts in the municipality of sara
5547945 in order to weaken the political influence of the salcedos in sara in preparation for the coming national elections this case is obviously the initial step toward it
5547946 wherefore premises considered it is most respectfully prayed of the honorable office that before hearing the preventive suspension issued the respondent be lifted after hearing the complaint be dismissed for lack of legal basis and for being purely concocted and fabricated
5547947 entirely written in english i did not understand the full imports of the same
5547948 as to identities of persons who are threatening our employees i have yet no personal knowledge of this fact as it was only relayed to me by a word of mouth from some of our personnel nevertheless we are still investigating this matter
5547949 that rather what i am aware of is the customary business practice in our terminal at sara municipal terminal of giving bookers commission for booking and scheduling passengers for our roro buses this giving of commission to bookers is an accepted customary business practice in our operations and is not being forced or extorted from vallacar transit incorporated
5547950 that moreover i was able to talk to other personnel from other bus companies and they were able to confirm that they too have their own bookers of whom they are giving commission to book and schedule their roro passengers as well
5547951 it is not easy to apprehend the suspects as drug transactions happen so fast the suspects change money and drugs by using their cars they just open their windows and speed away from the place
5547952 bisan kamo bal an ninyo kon sin o nga mga drug suspects pirmi gakadto didto for sure you are also aware that drug suspects frequent the place
5547953 drafted prepared and without my complete knowledge under fear for my life i was only made to sign and without knowing and understanding what are the contents
5547954 it was the last time i saw that affidavit until i heard over the radio the interview of governor niel tupas that my affidavit was already with him which was read in the air sic
5547955 that until now i cannot understand why governor tupas was interested of my affidavit when he is not a police or a fiscal nor a prosecuting arm of the government
5547956 that in view thereof whatever that kind of affidavit that governor tupas is holding and mentioning me as affiant i am repudiating and retracting the voluntariness of the execution of that affidavit through this voluntary free from any duress fear or intimidation and of my free will and volition affidavit of retraction
5547957 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5547958 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5547959 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5547960 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5547961 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5547962 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5547963 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5547964 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5547965 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5547966 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5547967 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5547968 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5547969 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5547970 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5547971 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5547972 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5547973 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5547974 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5547975 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5547976 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5547977 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5547978 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5547979 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5547980 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5547981 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5547982 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5547983 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5547984 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5547985 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5547986 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5547987 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5547988 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5547989 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5547990 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5547991 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5547992 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5547993 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5547994 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5547995 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5547996 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5547997 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5547998 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5547999 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5548000 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5548001 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5548002 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5548003 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5548004 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5548005 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5548006 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5548007 who are open to doing something on the production side
5548008 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5548009 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5548010 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5548011 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5548012 there is no greater richness than to enjoy friendship with christ
5548013 the most important service we can offer our brothers is the clear and humble proclamation of jesus christ
5548014 so that the lord will be better known loved followed and praised every day in those blessed lands
5548015 the present time is a providential occasion as with simplicity purity of heart and fidelity we again hear how christ reminds us that we are not servants but friends
5548016 he has conquered sin and death grants us his forgiveness daily teaches us to forgive and calls us to live a life free from egoism that enslaves us and brimming with love that stretches and dignifies us
5548017 he instructs us so that we will remain in his love without being conformed to the dictates of this world
5548018 thus with our whole life with the joy of knowing that we are loved by jesus whom we can call brother we will be valid instruments for him to continue to attract all with the mercy that flows from his cross
5548019 drink the vivifying water that flows from the side of the savior and satiates with its crystalline freshness all those who thirst for justice peace and truth those who are submerged in the thick fog of sin or the darkness of violence feel the consolation of christ and offer the balm of his love to the afflicted those who are weighed down by sorrow or who have remained wounded by the coldness of indifference or the scourge of corruption
5548020 these challenges call for overcoming individualism and isolation and for a strengthening of the sense of ecclesial belonging and loyal collaboration with pastors in order to form prayerful harmonious fraternal and missionary christian communities
5548021 persevering prayer fervent meditation on the word of god obedience to the magisterium of the church the dignified celebration of the sacraments and the testimony of fraternal charity
5548022 powerful force of the holy spirit has come who with his gifts and charisms continues to stimulate the church in proclaiming the good news of salvation to every person especially those who do not know christ or perhaps have forgotten him to the ends of the earth
5548023 to share this treasure with others as there is no greater richness than to enjoy friendship with christ and to walk beside him it is worthwhile to consecrate our best energies to this beautiful endeavor knowing that divine grace precedes sustains and accompanies us in its fulfillment
5548024 goes before us on the path of life and helps us to aspire to holiness so that the missionary that each one bears within himself will awaken and overcome the hesitation and mediocrity that often assails us
5548025 in face of the difficulties of an often hostile environment of the lack of immediate and spectacular results or of the insufficiency of human means i urge you not to be overcome by fear defeated by discouragement or pulled down by inertia
5548026 remember the words of jesus the good shepherd in the world you will meet with persecution
5548027 i am following with close attention and concern the situation in georgia and feel particularly close to the victims of the conflict
5548028 while i offer a special prayer for the repose of the souls of the deceased and express my sincere sympathy for all those in mourning i appeal for generous relief of the serious harm that the refugees are suffering especially women and children who even lack what is necessary to survive
5548029 i appeal for a prompt opening of humanitarian corridors between the region of south ossetia and the rest of georgia so that the dead who are still abandoned can receive a worthy burial and the wounded may be adequately attended and that those who long to be reunited with their loved ones may be permitted to do so
5548030 ethnic minorities involved in the conflict must be guaranteed safety and the inviolability of their fundamental rights
5548031 i hope finally that the present ceasefire agreed to thanks to the contribution of the european union might be consolidated and be transformed into a stable peace
5548032 at the same time i call upon the international community to continue offering its support to achieve a lasting solution through dialogue and the good will of all
5548033 respect the traditions viewpoints and hopes of the peoples of georgia and ossetia
5548034 to collaborate with the georgian orthodox church in favoring peace
5548035 expressing our alarm and distress at the violent events of recent days in the caucasus
5548036 we support the call for military forces to return to positions held before the current violence
5548037 we recognize that good relations between neighbors are a gift of god and an obligation of all people we ask that our member churches pray for the people of georgia and its neighbors and for all who in these days work for peace and reconciliation
5548038 human life is too precious and it is too unworthy of man to meet death or become an invalid due to causes that could mostly be avoided
5548039 there is certainly a need for a greater sense of responsibility above all by drivers as accidents are often caused by excessive speed and imprudent conduct
5548040 driving on public roads calls for moral and civic sense
5548041 christians must above all make a personal examination of conscience on their own conduct as drivers
5548042 moreover communities should educate everyone to consider traffic as a field in which life must be protected and love of neighbor concretely exercised
5548043 the word of god thus offers us the opportunity to reflect on the universality of the mission of the church made up of peoples of all races and cultures
5548044 indeed herein lies the great responsibility of the ecclesial community called to be a hospitable house for all sign and instrument of communion for the whole human family
5548045 how important it is especially in our time that every christian community be ever more conscious of this in order to help civil society to overcome every possible temptation to racism intolerance and exclusion and to organize itself with options that are respectful of the dignity of every human being
5548046 one of humanitys great victories is precisely the overcoming of racism unfortunately however there are new worrying manifestations of the latter often linked to social and economic problems which however can never justify contempt and racial discrimination
5548047 let us pray that respect for every person will grow everywhere together with the responsible awareness that only by the reciprocal acceptance of all is it possible to build a world marked by real justice and true peace
5548048 holy father how can we live the gifts of the holy spirit in practice here in our country and in our daily lives in such a way that our relatives friends and acquaintances feel and experience his power and how can we exercise our mission as christs witnesses
5548049 that faith today is a force that is present a force that can give people the right orientation this is why there was a moment in which we truly felt the breath of the holy spirit who sweeps away prejudices who makes people understand that yes here we find what closely affects us this is the direction in which we must go and in this way we can live in this way the future unfolds
5548050 it is far more difficult in practice to perceive the action of the holy spirit
5548051 in the end it is the lord who helps us but we must be available as instruments
5548052 i would say simply no one can give what he does not personally possess in other words we cannot pass on the holy spirit effectively or make him perceptible to others unless we ourselves are close to him
5548053 within the radius of the holy spirits breath in contact with him only if we are continually touched within by the holy spirit if he dwells in us will it be possible for us to pass him on to others
5548054 we in a certain sense must ask christ to breathe on us always so that his breath will become alive and strong and work upon the world this means that we must keep close to christ
5548055 as if we were to find ourselves strolling in the garden of the holy spirit we talk to him and he talks to us
5548056 and then naturally this listening walking in the environment of the word must be transformed into a response a response in prayer in contact with christ
5548057 god has access to us all the time we are in continuous contact with christ and we are continuously receiving the breath of the holy spirit
5548058 if we do this if we are not too lazy undisciplined or sluggish then something happens to us the day acquires a form and in it our life itself acquires a form and this light will shine from us without us having to give it much thought
5548059 human virtues show that faith is truly present that we are truly with christ and i believe that we should pay great attention to this also regarding ourselves to develop an authentic humanity in ourselves because faith involves the complete fulfillment of the human being of humanity
5548060 we should pay attention to carrying out human tasks well and correctly also in our profession in respect for our neighbor in being concerned about our neighbor which is the best way to be concerned about ourselves
5548061 in fact existing for our neighbor is the best way of existing for ourselves
5548062 those who write me expressed their joys to me but also their worries their life plans but also their family and work problems their heartfelt expectations and hopes as well as the anxieties connected with the uncertainty that humanity is experiencing at this time
5548063 i can assure each and all of you of my remembrance especially in the daily celebration of holy mass and in the recitation of the holy rosary
5548064 i know well that the first service i can render the church and humanity is in fact prayer because by praying i confidently place in the lords hands the ministry that he himself has entrusted to me together with the destiny of the whole ecclesial and civil community
5548065 those who pray never lose hope even when they find themselves in difficult and even humanly desperate situations
5548066 how many examples in fact we can recall of situations in which it was precisely prayer that sustained the journey of saints of the christian people
5548067 among the testimonies of our age i would like to mention that of two saints whose memory we recall these days teresa benedicta of the cross edith stein whose feast we celebrated on aug
5548068 both ended their earthly life with martyrdom in the auschwitz concentration camp it would seem that their existence could be regarded as a defeat but it is precisely in their martyrdom that the brilliance of love shines which conquers the darkness of egoism and hatred
5548069 heroic proof of love was his generous offer of himself instead of a prison companion an offer that culminated in death in a starvation bunker on aug 14 1941
5548070 witnesses who succeeded in fleeing from the terrible massacre recounted that teresa benedicta of the cross while dressed in the carmelite habit and moving consciously toward death was outstanding for her peaceful conduct and her serene attitude and her calm behavior and attention to the needs of all
5548071 prayer was the secret of this saint co patroness of europe
5548072 it is moving to see how humble and trusting recourse to our lady is always the source of courage and serenity
5548073 l et us renew our trust in her who from heaven watches over us with maternal love at every moment
5548074 in addition to providing two meals a day they have also started to distribute articles such as blankets towels washbasins and hygiene products for babies and women
5548075 fortunately it has a warehouse of goods for urgent needs
5548076 to ensure psychological support for all those who have lost their homes
5548077 russia and georgia must step back from all out war already the conflict has caused too much suffering to thousands of innocent civilians it will take a huge regional effort to rebuild shattered communities
5548078 appeals to both sides to do everything in their power to respect the lives of civilians caritas supports the need for humanitarian corridors into south ossetia as a short term solution but peace talks must take place now
5548079 father thomas is a martyr he sacrificed his life for the poor and marginalized
5548080 but he did not die in vain because his body and his blood enrich the church in india particularly the church in andhra pradesh the southeastern state where he died
5548081 the church in india is shocked and deeply saddened by this barbarous killing the result of a growing climate of intolerance and violence against christians in this country
5548082 have for decades been at the service of the least fortunate in india and this makes them targets of forces of evil who do not want the marginalized and impoverished to become empowered
5548083 even after being led to the truth in the peace of the contemplative life had to live to the fullest the mystery of the cross
5548084 and the foreigners who join themselves to the lord to minister to him i will bring to my holy mountain and make them joyful in my house of prayer for my house shall be called a house of prayer
5548085 if we live with christ we will also succeed in human things
5548086 you will receive power when the holy spirit has come upon you and you will be my witnesses
5548087 if you desire the spirit of god you must be in the body of christ
5548088 this is more powerful than the discoth que it is really beautiful here because i can do something for others
5548089 were not worried about it weve seen this movie before
5548090 there are bad storms and there are nice ones and this is a nice one
5548091 it cleans out all the trees it gives people a little work to do and it gets the tourists out of here for a few days
5548092 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5548093 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5548094 ive got a generator and ive got a concrete home that i built myself so i know it can withstand this
5548095 every hurricane that we have we have additional lessons learned and experience
5548096 this is a broad really diffuse storm all the florida keys and all the florida peninsula are going to feel the effects of this storm no matter where the center makes landfall
5548097 i decree to todd bentley your power will increase your authority will increase your favor will increase your influence will increase your revelation will increase i also decree that a new supernatural strength will flow through this ministry a new life force will penetrate this move of god
5548098 god will pour out a higher level of discernment to distinguish truth from error new relationships will surface to open the gates to the future
5548099 kingly intercession is released through decrees with them we legislate gods will on earth in much the same way an earthly king would dictate his
5548100 a type of govern mental intercession or legislating from the heavens
5548101 a decree is an official order edict or decision a decree is something that seems to be foreordained this is what makes a decree prophetic decree can also mean to order decide or offi cially appoint a group or person to accomplish something a decree is linked with setting apart or ordaining something or someone
5548102 a ccording to what we have heard from several sources this is much more than just an emotional relationship according to staff and former staff members they claim that todd is a pathological liar the board privately has said that todd has been lying to them all along we are praying for those around todd to demand for him to get the help he needs before thrusting him back into ministry like they did 2 5 years ago when he had an affair with a different staff member
5548103 w henever a prophet speaks in my name and the prediction is not fulfilled then i have not spoken it the prophet has presumed to speak it so you need not fear him
5548104 it serves to distract the public councils and enfeeble the public administration agitates the community with ill founded jealousies and false alarms kindles the animosity of one against another it opens the door to foreign influence and corruption thus the policy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and will of another
5548105 perfect finishing touch for a card a hair clip gift wrap and all kinds of other stuff
5548106 the storms not a concern it just doesnt look like its going to do a lot of damage
5548107 im an only child my father was a cowboy and he really loved me very much but i think he wanted a son occasionally
5548108 the fact that weve never been recognized and then cindy has to put such a fine point on it by saying something thats not true recently again and again its just very very hurtful
5548109 we are going to send the message that we are not going to allow russia to draw a new line at those states that are not yet integrated into the transatlantic structures like georgia and ukraine
5548110 youll see a nato more united than you might expect
5548111 we hope that tomorrows decisions by nato will be balanced and that responsible forces in the west will give up the total cynicism that has been so evident which is pushing us back to the cold war era dmitry rogozin told reporters on monday
5548112 we dont want to hear that mikheil saakashvili is a saint
5548113 f or those of us who remember the super finned cadillacs of old just mentioning a cadillac in the same breath as a corvette is mind boggling but there it is and it is goodness gracious great balls of fire fun to drive
5548114 the dramatic wedge shape is enhanced by sharp edges and angles that reflect the new cadillac brand look derived directly from the evoq concept car introduced about five years ago at the detroit auto show
5548115 opinions were mixed on how well the look and feel of the interior reflects the cars 75 000 price tag
5548116 the rich color of the wood trim looks as good as anything you might find in a lexus but the aluminum accents arent quite as convincing as some of the metallic panels look more like snapped on covers than integrated pieces of a cohesive design
5548117 a six year old child lived at the premises and he is currently unaccounted for insp schafferius said
5548118 at this stage weve located two bodies inside the premises a 34 year old man and a 29 year old woman
5548119 four of our crews were able to contain the blaze to the northeastern end of the building but they discovered that that part of the building actually housed people the spokeswoman said

5548123 we have been sort of like john mccain but not co summer flip flops
5548124 i would not have nominated clarence thomas i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation of a lot of the constitution
5548125 though he assured the audience that at least they were smart enough for the job
5548126 so lets see by the time he was nominated clarence thomas had worked in the missouri attorney generals office served as an assistant secretary of education run the equal employment opportunity commission and sat for a year on the d c circuit court of appeals the nations second most prominent court
5548127 isnt yet four years out of the illinois state senate has never held a hearing of note with his u s senate subcommittee and had an unremarkable record as both a community organizer and law school lecturer
5548128 omg you talked about me so let me kick your ass
5548129 when are you going to be playing at ruby skye
5548130 it could backfire and show that her influence is waning
5548131 dyn politico com 8 17 08 obama plans to speed through the vote and not take to much tv time again hoping also to avoid a scenario where hillary is leading at any point in time
5548132 i think they had some good moments and not so good moments
5548133 when i used to play against him you just couldnt throw the ball in the middle of the field because
5548134 lowes bucked the trend of its linkage to housing turnover as same store sales recovered nicely at a moment when historical trends suggested they should have been troughing
5548135 the further you get into the economic downturn the more pressure that puts on less well capitalized competitors
5548136 guys dont always feel chipper in the first part of the week when they get dinged up but they find a way to push to saturday

5548145 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5548146 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5548147 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5548148 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5548149 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5548150 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5548151 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5548152 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5548153 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5548154 there is still a need to address wider regulatory burdens and inconsistencies across archaic state laws including oh amp s retail leasing payroll tax and food safety

5548168 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5548169 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5548170 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5548171 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5548172 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5548173 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5548174 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice

5548208 a six year old child lived at the premises and he is currently unaccounted for insp schafferius said

5548211 obama was caught red handed in his attempt to deceive the american people when nrlc released these official documents
5548212 i have said repeatedly that i would have been completely in fully in support of the federal bill that everybody supported which was to say that you should provide assistance to any infant that was born even if it was as a consequence of an induced abortion that was not the bill that was presented at the state level what that bill also was doing was trying to undermine roe v wade
5548213 so for people to suggest that i somehow in favor of withholding life saving support from an infant born alive is ridiculous it defies commonsense and it defies imagination and for people to keep on pushing this is offensive and its an example of the kind of politics we have to get beyond its one thing for people to disagree with me about the issue of choice its another thing for people to out and out misrepresent my positions repeatedly even after they know that theyre wrong
5548214 we now challenge obama to either declare the two 2003 documents to be forgeries and call for an official investigation or else apologize for his four years of misrepresentation on the issue of babies who are born alive during abortions and forcalling us liars

5548261 through these u s military and intelligence agencies the united states government is sending a dangerous and double message if this continues it will subvert our entire human rights policy
5548262 they dont meet the death squads on the streets where theyre actually chopping up people or laying them down on the street and running trucks over their heads the cia people in san salvador meet the police chiefs and the people who run the death squads and they do liaise with them they meet them beside the swimming pool of the villas and its a sophisticated civilized kind of relationship and they talk about their children who are going to school at ucla or harvard and other schools and they dont talk about the horrors of whats being done they pretend like it isnt true
5548263 caballero said his superior officers ordered him and other members of army intelligence units to conceal their participation in death squads from cia advisers
5548264 they prepared me in interrogation to end the use of physical torture in honduras they taught psychological methods
5548265 so when we had someone important we hid him from the americans interrogated him ourselves and then gave him to a death squad to kill
5548266 to induce psychological regression in the subject by bringing a superior outside force to bear on his will to resist
5548267 president bush told us that the last 14 cia prisoners were sent to guantanamo but there are many other prisoners disappeared by the cia whose fate is still unknown
5548268 the question is what happened to these people and where are they now
5548269 primary responsibility for the defense of latin america against external attack that the role of the latin american nations in this mission is to be de emphasized and that the internal security mission of latin american nations is to be accorded increased emphasis
5548270 as further means of coping with indirect communist penetration of the hemisphere the u s should seek to create increased awareness on the part of latin american countries of the danger to hemispheric security posed by castroism and communism in general and of the need to take prompt multilateral action when necessary to eliminate this danger negotiate or renegotiate as may be required bilateral agreements designed to provide assistance to countries requesting help in defending themselves against indirect aggression and subversion directed and sustained by communists from within or without the hemisphere
5548271 the congress determined that it was inadvisable for the united states to continue supporting any foreign police organizations
5548272 the criminal divisions international criminal investigative training assistance program icitap and overseas prosecutorial development assistance and training opdat office foster support and strengthen democratic principles and structures of law enforcement in foreign countries particularly in those countries that have recently embraced democracy icitap and opdat provide training for police prosecutors and the judiciary and advice on american laws and programs to combat crime within a democratic framework
5548273 janice stromsem a career employee of the justice department who served as icitaps director resisted the programs takeover by cia elements in february 1999 stromsem was relieved of her duties after complaining to the justice department inspector general that icitap was being used by the cia to recruit agents among foreign police officials
5548274 could not accurately determine the extent or cost of assistance to foreign police
5548275 some double counting of students may be occurring and agencies may not be differentiating between assistance provided to police and assistance provided to the military
5548276 the agency supplying the training and the agency paying for the training may both include the trainees in their reporting systems such as when icitap pays for students attending the fbi academy
5548277 travel expenses salaries and expendable items such as course materials
5548278 also gao could not always determine whether a student was a police officer or a military member because some agencies do not collect such data dod officials informed us that once they receive permission to train police in a specific activity they do not provide a further accounting breakdown for example training provided to the eastern caribbean regional security system was for law enforcement personnel although a few trainees may have belonged to military organizations
5548279 the effect of the various pieces of legislation and resulting programs is that there is a lot of disparate police training and some interagency competition but without anyone in charge the coordinator believes that this does not serve u s interests he stated that a policy coordinating committee coordinates all antiterrorism assistance delivered by participating agencies such as the fbi and the state department he noted however that the committee does not coordinate with agencies providing police training outside of the ata umbrella in addition although inm dea and the other agencies providing narcotics control assistance coordinate with each other officials informed us that they do not routinely coordinate with ata or icitap on police assistance activities
5548280 for example the ata program generally is coordinated through the embassys regional security officer while icitap generally coordinates its activities through a political officer or directly with the ambassador and dea manages its programs through either an in country attache or a special narcotics coordinator

5548286 an inspector general report of investigation of a11egatipns that the agency was instrumental in bringing about the assassination of south vietnam the allegations were determined to be without foundation
5548287 solid evidence of a plot to assassinate republic of congo strong hostility to lumumba voiced at the very highest levels of government may have been intended to initiate an assassination operation at the least it engendered such an operation the evidence indicates that it is likely that eisenhowers expression of strong concern about lumumba at a meeting of the national security council on august 18 1960 was taken by allen dulles as authority to assassinate lumumba there is however testimony there is however testimony by eisenhower administration officials and ambiguity and lack of clarity in the records of high level policy meetings which tends to contradict the evidence that the president intended an assassination effort against lumumba in a footnote the committee cited an unnamed official as saying he had heard eisenhower order the assassination
5548288 any particular kind of activity which might contribute to getting rid of lumumba
5548289 the following day dulles cabled a cia station officer in leopoldville republic of the congo that
5548290 shortly thereafter the cias clandestine service formulated a plot to assassinate lumumba the plot proceeded to the point that lethal substances and instruments specifically intended for use in an assassination were delivered by the cia to the congo station there is no evidence that these instruments of assassination were actually used against lumumba

5548309 a mccain campaign aide tells abc news that reed sent out an email solicitation on his own encouraging people to support senator mccain but was not invited to the fundraiser
5548310 the mccain campaign has outspent the obama camp by hundreds of thousands of dollars and in some cases by as much as a million dollars or more in virtually all of the nearly dozen battleground states where both campaigns are up on the air
5548311 for all the talk of post partisan unity barack obama has been proving himself the most party focused presidential candidate in recent history possibly ever paradoxically although obamas success has been more dependent on personal charisma than any recent nominees has hes been leveraging that charisma to build a broader democratic infrastructure less dependent on the presidential nominee

5548381 the hispanic population is growing whites and asians are not replacing themselves
5548382 its the hispanic population that is keeping us above water in terms of growth in terms of births
5548383 a half century ago a woman who had a child outside of marriage was highly stigmatized
5548384 we need to focus a lot more than we have before on the education opportunities for immigrant children this makes very clear that theyre a big part of our future
5548385 i wondered why that was true and found that those second generation hispanic mothers did have higher education attainment than the third generation
5548386 it means that 25 years from now therell be many elderly people who are childless and who may not have anybody to care for them
5548387 i had always used my local planned parenthood for my yearly exam but i finally had a job with full benefits and thought id try to find a gynecologist since well woman exams were part of my coverage
5548388 you might as well get that uterus out now since youre not going to use it
5548389 i knew we were in for some drama when we signed in at the front desk and the receptionist asked if my husband was with me
5548390 i replied that my partner was with me and she acted embarrassed and flustered the patient forms all contained references to a persons husband or spouse and i had to scratch the word out and replace it with partner
5548391 at least not one who made a big deal about it
5548392 the only problem we faced there was trying to get an appointment it seems that every lesbian couple in the metropolitan area was trying to use the same doctor at the same time
5548393 the congress of the united states needs to take action immediately to support the men and women who are serving our country while members of congress are taking their summer vacations veterans and their families are dealing with serious problems from their service to our nation members of congress need to come back from their vacations today and support our military families
5548394 whether it is providing the necessary resources to get mental health treatments for veterans and their families to overhauling the veterans disability system to protecting our servicemembers from unfair contracts the united states congress needs to send a clear message we support our troops and their families and we will never forget their sacrifices
5548395 not only do we need to fully fund this world class facility we need to fund satellite campuses across the nation to ensure the most sophisticated treatment for our wounded veterans suffering from traumatic brain injury and psychological health issues
5548396 if that means one less bridge to nowhere then so be it
5548397 i did give documents a long time ago but these matters have been resolved for a long time now as far as im concerned
5548398 i just got off of the florida food bank association conference call about supplies

5548400 were actually sending out more food than were taking in to the tune of 200 thousand pounds
5548401 i mean im looking through here and im seeing a lot of empty space in front of us and behind us
5548402 we would rather at this point depend on inland food banks
5548403 let tennessee send some down because its too risky for us for the next 30 days

5548407 to sit back hoping that someday some way someone will make things right is to go on feeding the crocodile hoping he will eat you last but eat you he will
5548408 good people sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf
5548409 they that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety

5548420 i find students who come from really conservative protestant churches are not aware that there are other conceptions of god out there when they run into them they really have a hard time knowing how to respond
5548421 how do you feel about another faith that may not see it quite that way
5548422 i never really thought about it but thats my version of god
5548423 well how would accept another persons version of god as being that would you call that god or would you call that something else
5548424 thats not god thats something else that person might be deceiving themselves

5548447 when it comes to presenting music from the 5 th dimension it was really important for us to attempt to recreate the original harmonies of the group to the best of our abilities it was the original harmonies that made us stand out when we first began we have always been proud of its uniqueness
5548448 after the death of ron townson and the retirement of lamonte mclemore we realize that it will be impossible to ever duplicate the sound again through a reunion of the original members however we have tried to come as close as possible
5548449 you dont have to be a star to be in my show
5548450 we have learned that our music is a mutual experience that we have been fortunate to share we are gratified by the audience participation as they are reminded of possibly kinder gentler times
5548451 we are so thankful that we have been able to realize the dream that we had from our youth to have a career in music and to enjoy so many levels of success we want to feature some of those highlights in the 40 th anniversary celebration show

5548453 wyndham is one of the largest growth corridors in the state and to achieve such a turnaround in the numbers of reported crime is fantastic especially when there has been such a dramatic decrease in violent offences
5548454 there were issues with police numbers here but we have distributed resources as best we can
5548455 we are allocated two billion dollars from the budget and we have to work with what we have
5548456 with the resources we do have we have decreased crime from occurring
5548457 this may be linked to the increased possession of small expensive electrical items including mobile phones and mp3 players

5548466 in an age of digital manipulation many people believe that snapshots and family photos need no longer stand as a authoritative record of what was but instead of what they wish it was
5548467 i think the guy calls em as he sees em and as president would call em as he sees em and would make people mad all over the place because it wouldnt fit anybodys playbook
5548468 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5548469 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5548470 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5548471 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5548472 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5548473 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5548474 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5548475 this is about a publishers commitment to its author to get one of a very few pro obama books out into the marketplace in the shortest amount of time
5548476 our initial order was based on the book being available to all booksellers simultaneously an even playing field
5548477 they are not going to bully us and the book will be a huge success in spite of their boycott
5548478 estelle looked absolutely beautiful in person as well as on screen from the band to the background vocalists amp cast everyone looked fly and stylish jackie amp taraji lightened up the cameras with their acting abilities amp comedic gestures that added a great feeling to the video the video was well directed and very organized it was a great turn out
5548479 im new naive and eager to please but will never give up my soul and inner character
5548480 citing only one study in support of a politically desired conclusion cannot be explained in any other way than a politically motivated exercise
5548481 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5548482 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5548483 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points

5548488 dont believe we can integrate take two ahead of the important holiday season
5548489 as i mentioned when we spoke on friday our process begins with an in depth management presentation the company has made significant strides since ea first expressed interest in the company and this presentation includes material non public information to which you would not otherwise have access including information relating to our three year product release schedule and managements financial projections the presentation also includes information about the underlying factors that have driven our strong operational and financial performance i believe our presentation will enable you to understand better the value of our company to ea prior to the management presentation we will only require ea to enter into a confidentiality agreement we understand that a number of months have passed since you first expressed interest in the company and accordingly we will act quickly to assist you in moving through our process once we execute a confidentiality agreement we are prepared to schedule the management presentation immediately
5548490 it seems he didnt have any swelling or anything coming out of surgery
5548491 were getting to the point where we need to have everybody on the field
5548492 were downhill the way i look at it in our preparation towards northern illinois we have a lot of work to do and it was good to have a couple guys back
5548493 hes a guy who can transfer information from the classroom to the field without many reps and execute the offense
5548494 hes a very bright kid and that ability to execute with limited reps for a backup quarterback is a good commodity to have
5548495 its a tough job but you never know with big ten football sometimes you need three four quarterbacks
5548496 offensive coordinator mike dunbar does a great job of giving us all the information yes it helps to get reps but if you pay attention during meetings you can learn through osmosis in a way
5548497 this is a very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
5548498 we are not going to allow russia to draw a new line at those states that are not yet integrated into the trans atlantic structures
5548499 we have to deny russian strategic objectives which are clearly to undermine georgias democracy to use its military capability to damage and in some cases destroy georgian infrastructure and to try and weaken the georgian state
5548500 the neoconservatives who have controlled the bush regime in washington their plan is to bring russia along with the entire middle east and iran under american hegemony so that whatever happens in the world is dictated from washington
5548501 we are going to send the message that we are not going to allow russia to draw a new line at those states that are not yet integrated into the transatlantic structures like georgia and ukraine
5548502 its a ministerial meeting on the georgian crisis so it is normal that she is there
5548503 we dont want to hear that mikheil saakashvili is a saint
5548504 i think youll see a nato more united than you might expect
5548505 the foreign ministers will also probably send a message of solidarity and will agree on a package of measures
5548506 including the international mechanism to monitor respect of the engagements taken by both sides
5548507 strengthening is expected tonight and tuesday and fay is forecast to be at or near hurricane strength winds of 119 kilometers or 74 miles per hour as it approaches the southwestern coast of florida
5548508 tornadoes are likely in some areas tonight monday and tomorrow and maybe even into the next few days
5548509 even though this storm doesnt look like its very dangerous and people will say its just a tropical storm or its just a category one hurricane our experience with florida tells us that if were not careful we will lose people
5548510 we have amazing waves today something not seen very often on this beaches its a perfect day
5548511 brother rick i forgot to mention during my report that the wmu raised 2 million for lottie moon this last christmas
5548512 well i have no idea who this lottie moon lady is but she certainly is rolling in the dough
5548513 yknow we could really use some mcdonalds right about now
5548514 he is a great senator and i think he would be a good v p
5548515 if barack obama felt the he needed to pick a running mate with significant foreign policy credentials joe biden is the no brainer
5548516 i think he should pick joe biden because he has the experience on the international playing field
5548517 im gonna kill them all with my hammer like i killed the giants
5548518 no you better let me use my lightening like scissors like i cut the legs off the whales and dinosaurs into lizards
5548519 ill split them right down the middle gonna cut them right up in half
5548520 and you would be getting in front of me for what reason
5548521 i think she needs to have her baggage checked a little more closely
5548522 why do you get to take that bottle through security
5548523 do you really carry that much baggage around with you when you fly
5548524 i was really just curious about the weight i was hauling
5548525 you know john mcenroe the foul tempered tennis star blank look from the 80s eyes glazing over the era of jimmy connors chris everett no response
5548526 happy new year he chirped at the groggy voice i hope you are enjoying your sleep as much as i enjoyed mine last night
5548527 as my attempts of levity were rebuffed i was forced to take a more direct tack
5548528 its no wonder your parents are getting rid of you for the summer i wouldnt want to be around you either heres a garbage bag now clean up that mess before you get off the plane
5548529 the two of you have been horrible little children and i hope that i never see either one of you again
5548530 my yes it was long before you were born at least fifty years ago
5548531 tha t was back in the days when they padded the lavatory doors
5548532 no one could hear me yelling and pounding on the door and i was trapped inside when the plane landed
5548533 i took off my high heeled shoe and hammered on the door until i knocked a hole through it one of the stewardesses finally heard the racket and was able to open the door and let me out
5548534 then she had the nerve to tell me that i would have to pay for the damage to the door
5548535 can you tell me where the canned artichoke hearts are
5548536 but i have to say its not an example of putting country first when you say president george bush s economic policies have shown great progress
5548537 mr mccain let me explain to you the economic disaster is happening right now maybe you havent noticed
5548538 in matters of national security good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president as we were all reminded 10 days ago by events in the nation of georgia
5548539 it was a moment when political self interest and the national interest parted ways
5548540 for my part with so much in the balance it was an easy call as i said at the time i would rather lose an election than lose a war
5548541 even in retrospect obama would chose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5548542 por um momento lembrei de uma professora minha de ingl s do ensino m dio ela dizia voc nunca vai ser bem sucedido em nada esse tipo de coisa volta cabe a engra ado
5548543 that wasnt too bad why are they complaining so much
5548544 hurry up get to the bathroom and get right back
5548545 reclaiming public spaces as a space for public imagination and enlightenment where they have become propagandistic barriers to thought and awareness
5548546 youre the only person i know whos received death threats
5548547 dan thats touching really it is but a few notes on my front door from a balding overweight middle aged distraught father hardly constitutes a serious threat to my safety but if you think this guy is serious and it sounds to me like he is you need to call the cops
5548548 ok well i just got to lauras and i have to get gus settled before i get to the hospital for my shift that starts in ten minutes so ive got to go ill call you when i get off ok
5548549 theyve got the plate in on the right leg and theyre just finishing it up they still have to do the left

5548552 i had patients to check on and then i thought id take you to breakfast
5548553 im supposed to pick gus up at one and i have to get some sleep first
5548554 then george one day was watching it and said i want him to sound like truman capote
5548555 i really do love and admire all thats come out of stephens christian beliefs
5548556 its just that theres three or four things that im not down with and ive warned him ive said you need to know if you say something and i dont agree with it and somebody asks me about it you have to be prepared for me to let people know how i feel and you gotta be prepared for the gloves to come off and right now with gay marriage thats one of the ways another one is when he says to me if you dont believe what it says in this book the bible then youre not going to heaven youre going to hell then i dont want to go to that heaven i dont want to go to that place with the people who believe what he believes
5548557 part of it is my education my upbringing the values instilled in me by my parents part of it was the community i was raised in and part of it is the creative arts community
5548558 my brother stephen has always been non political or apolitical his whole life he doesnt have a lot of experience with politics my brother alec and i went to university we both graduated we both have degrees in political science we both worked in washington on capitol hill weve both been very active in political organizations stephen is sort of na ve and inexperienced not in all of life but hes not as experienced or knowledgeable about politics
5548559 right now im filming this new series for the bbc called

5548561 i feel blessed to be asked to stay on board here at access and with the show constantly evolving its an exciting place to work

5548573 the less restrictive conditions could be soon be called for

5548575 unfortunately there are still some commando teams from georgia that are walking around
5548576 last day there were several small skirmishes our troops were fired upon
5548577 it depends on looters and so on so it depends on the situation but it will take days certainly not weeks
5548578 if anyone thinks that they can kill our citizens our soldiers and officers who are peacekeepers and escape unpunished we will never allow this
5548579 development lecture 101 would include such homilies as never use a vendors valuation and if the creditors and funders are on the scene that you will always get the properties at a much cheaper price from a receiver

5548596 as president ill make our space program a priority again by devoting the attention and resources needed to not only inspire the world with feats of exploration but also improve life here on earth
5548597 sometimes it is difficult to know what a politician will actually do once in office because they say different things at different times to different people
5548598 this is a particular problem when a candidate has a short thin record on the issues as in the case of senator obama let me say just in case senator obama does decide to return to his original plan of cutting nasa funding i oppose such cuts
5548599 i will ensure that space exploration remains a top priority and that the u s continues to lead the world in this field
5548600 i am not going to sway my principles for you just because you are a delawarean joe you let me down several times over the years i have not forgotten i will not forget
5548601 he wanted to give them an idea of where he wanted to go with this
5548602 there was no whirring glass bubble like maxwell smart or something like that he was speaking to the integrity of the arrangement
5548603 he literally disabled it even if someone tried to turn it on it wouldnt work
5548604 may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5548605 there is not one shred of evidence that its true

5548610 the great and continuing challenge represented by the threat to democracy in fiji
5548611 it is absolutely regrettable that the leader of fiji has decided not to attend this forum
5548612 the reasons for not attending which have been provided are simply not persuasive
5548613 we in the south pacific and pacific island countries in particular take democracy seriously
5548614 sit idly by while the principals of democracy are shredded
5548615 therefore it has been resolved that the pacific island countries will act in concert on this question and we look forward very much to the discussions which will now occur on this issue in nuie on how this matter should be handled into the future
5548616 it is regrettable that fiji will not be represented in its own right given that fiji and the traducement of democracy is the core topic for discussion
5548617 there is no reasonable excuse at all for fiji not attending the forum
5548618 i personally intervened to ensure that travel visas were available for the fiji delegation to go through auckland airport to nuie so they could be accountable to forum leaders for commitments given last year
5548619 very disappointed that the fiji interim government has determined not to be represented for reasons which can only be described as spurious
5548620 no doubt the forum will be in touch with the interim of fiji afterwards to convey the views of the forum
5548621 the issue will be whether in the light of the fiji interim governments non attendance whether leaders will be a mind to take the matter further than the ministerial contact group envisaged
5548622 the belief that only people with proper credentials should be hired if you go to college you implicitly support credentialism or at least you do not reject it if you refuse to go to college then you show disrespect for credentialism that disrespect may represent a threat to hiring managers who are credentialist

5548625 there are countries like thailand that are value for money and do not have restrictive visa compliance conditions

5548627 getting a malaysian visa was back breaking earlier the government eased the norms and there was a considerable jump in the numbers visiting malaysia now again if the malaysian government wants to do away the visa on arrival facility it will have to bear the consequences the decline will start from diwali onwards
5548628 the number of people using the visa on arrival is comparatively small the number of bonafide travel numbers will go up and also procuring the visa will be easy as we can give it in three working days

5548643 we calculated about 135 times hed been interrogated and about the first 120 the only interest they had was al jazeera
5548644 they told him that they thought al jazeera was an al qaeda front
5548645 they were trying to get him to finger a number of well known al jazeera journalists as being in the muslim brotherhood
5548646 they wanted me to betray the principles of my job and to turn me into a spy
5548647 if we were going to try to silence al jazeera it would be at a higher level of personnel than some cameraman trainee

5548712 plaintiff guadalupe t benitez is a lesbian who lives with her partner joanne clark in san diego county
5548713 they wanted benitez to become pregnant and they decided on intravaginal self insemination a nonmedical process in which a woman inserts sperm into her own vagina
5548714 in 1999 after several unsuccessful efforts at pregnancy through this method
5548715 benitez was diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome a disorder characterized by irregular ovulation and she was referred to defendant north coast womens care medical group inc north coast for fertility treatment
5548716 benitez and clark first met with defendant christine brody an obstetrician and gynecologist employed by defendant north coast benitez mentioned that she was a lesbian
5548717 dr brody explained that at some point intrauterine insemination iui might have to be considered
5548718 in that medical procedure a physician threads a catheter through the patients cervix and inserts semen through the catheter into the patients uterus dr brody said that if iui became necessary her religious beliefs would preclude her from performing the procedure for benitez
5548719 according to benitez however dr brody said that she was the only north coast physician with a religious objection to performing iui for benitez and that all other members of her practice whom she believed lacked her bias would be available to do this medical procedure
5548720 but he refused to prepare donated fresh sperm for benitez because of his religious objection
5548721 two of his colleagues drs charles stoopack and ross langley had no such religious objection but unlike dr fenton they were not licensed to prepare fresh sperm dr fenton then referred benitez to a physician outside north coasts medical practice dr michael kettle
5548722 the iui performed by dr kettle did not result in a pregnancy benitez was unable to conceive until june 2001 when dr kettle performed in vitro fertilization
5548723 benitez sued north coast and its physicians brody and fenton seeking damages and injunctive relief on several theories notably sexual orientation discrimination in violation of californias unruh civil rights act

5548726 allowing a school administration to censor in any way is contrary to the democratic process and the ability of a student newspaper to serve as the watchdog and bring sunshine to the actions of school administrators it is quite disheartening to hear that after we specifically prohibited prior restraint by administrators that some are engaging in this type of nefarious activity and even firing quality teachers because of content in the student newspaper
5548727 in a span of four months they all but stripped me of my professional existence
5548728 since administrators are unable by law to exercise prior restraint with regard to a student publication they lean on advisers to do what they legally cannot
5548729 when advisers refuse they are punished because administrators know they will face no legal consequences sb 1370 is necessary to close this gaping loophole in the law

5548789 the rba at its september meeting should really take account of the impact of the slowing domestic demand and the particularly severe impact it has had on small business

5548822 the blood gushed out and was all over my face it took a while for everyone to realise i was injured

5548830 over 375 cinemas have lost heavily due to the film being a disaster at the turnstiles we have announced a movement for non cooperation against kuselan producers k balachander and seven arts international and are meeting on aug 23 to chalk out our plans with regard to rajnikant
5548831 the loss will cross over rs 250 million in the short term unless adequate remedial measures are initiated by the actor who has immensely benefited out of our labours in the past we were taken for a ride by the producers who claimed it was a full length rajnikant film which it was not

5548833 i am just on the verge of finishing a script i am working on about the functioning and psychology of media so far you have seen the media exposing things and now i want to expose the media in all its naked glory
5548834 the media has transformed from a truth telling machinery to a power mongering and money making enterprise
5548835 watching with glee someone else fall down and to be ripped to shreds
5548836 they tend to fall in love more with the way they rip the film apart much more than they hate the film
5548837 when they journalists get a certain whiff of an interesting story on someone their greatest fear would be that it will be denied by the person
5548838 it is primarily because most of the mumbai media hobnobs and rubs shoulders with the film people
5548839 the film people out of their fear and greed and in order to use the media people open their doors to them and almost become informants to the media about the rest of their colleagues in the industry
5548840 media looses its primary objective and tends to get embroiled in the camp culture of the industry
5548841 i dont believe that the media is so dumb it was unintentional and when i wrote the 11 things it was all in good humour i even made fun of myself in the blog why is it being taken further
5548842 well always respond to calls even if only two are on staff

5548844 i believe in my heart that had kathleen savios case been properly handled my sister would most likely be alive today

5548853 i saw him at christmas and birthdays and he provided money for school clothes and he called occasionally
5548854 what she found in town on the day of or the day before or the day after his funeral was that the credit card didnt work anymore
5548855 the fact that weve never been recognized and then cindy has to put such a fine point on it by saying something thats not true recently again and again its just very very hurtful

5548862 lyndon johnson was married to a very rich woman in the broadcasting business well that has a little bit of political effect and that is a business with a lot of political interests and beer is a business with a lot of political interests too beer is affected by all kinds of legal questions
5548863 shes very very hands on with comforting the parents who are anxious and perhaps shows them pictures of her own daughter
5548864 theres nobody down there in dire straits because they dont have any food or water right now

5548870 if the recapitalization talk is realized there are no assurances that the securities that have been issued by u s mortgage firms will be 100 percent guaranteed

5548873 clearly quite tight and are getting tighter as commercial banks pass on their increased borrowing costs to customers
5548874 given there had been a significant change in borrowing behaviour confidence was weaker asset prices had declined and slower overall growth was in prospect tighter financial conditions were not warranted the minutes said
5548875 indeed less restrictive conditions could soon be called for otherwise the risk of a deeper and more persistent slowing in the economy would increase
5548876 on these considerations a case could be made for an early reduction in the cash rate
5548877 scope to move towards a less restrictive setting of monetary policy was judged to be increasing
5548878 given the slower trend in demand scope to move towards a less restrictive setting of monetary policy was judged to be increasing the minutes said
5548879 firstly a lengthy period of inflation above the target was occurring with attendant risk that this would begin to affect wage setting though there was no evidence of this in aggregate wages data to date the minutes said
5548880 if that occurred the cost of reducing inflation later would be greater
5548881 policy had to take account of this risk particularly given both the recent high cpi reading and those in prospect in the near term
5548882 the staff forecast for growth had been revised down slightly while that for inflation was slightly higher in the near term but still saw inflation starting to fall back towards the target during 2009 and 2010 the minutes said
5548883 the staff forecast for growth of the australian economy over the year ahead had been lowered slightly and remained below consensus the minutes said
5548884 it was likely that the headline rate of inflation would rise further in the immediate future but the softer demand outlook meant that inflation was still forecast to decline during 2009 and to be consistent with the target during 2010
5548885 clear evidence of that decline beginning however was unlikely to be seen for a while yet
5548886 the national accounts for the june quarter to be published in early september were likely to show that growth of gdp had been low and the staff forecasts suggested that a weak outcome in the september quarter was also possible the minutes said
5548887 members continued to see considerable uncertainty about the outlook for demand and inflation as the economy remained subject to powerful forces pulling in opposite directions the minutes said
5548888 tighter financial conditions were causing the economy to slow but on the other hand the rise in the terms of trade would continue to add substantially to national income and capacity to spend
5548889 for confidentiality reasons i cant tell you the exact amount but the funds on all the claims range from less than 50 to several thousand dollars

5548893 politicians are not serious about the environment and are using the issue as an excuse to raise more revenue from green taxes
5548894 not just about the stratosphere its about the street corner
5548895 if we are serious about reducing global greenhouse emissions the nuclear option is one we cannot ignore
5548896 the biggest gains in cutting greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation in the shortest possible time and at the lowest cost and least economic risk will come from nuclear power
5548897 its a black and white answer or should i say black and yellow answer clean coal and yellowcake we must include nuclear in our future base load clean energy mix

5548899 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention the real enemy then is humanity itself
5548900 the desire to save humanity is always a false front for the urge to rule it
5548901 this crippling of individuals i consider the worst evil of capitalism i am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils namely through the establishment of a socialist economy accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals in such an economy the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion a planned economy which adjusts production to the needs of the community would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man woman and child

5548903 the modern literature on hate crimes began with a remarkable 1933 book by arthur raper titled the tragedy of lynching raper assembled data on the number of lynchings each year in the south and on the price of an acres yield of cotton he calculated the correla tion coefficient between the two series at 0 532 in other words when the economy was doing well the number of lynchings was lower in 2001 donald green laurence mcfalls and jennifer smith published a paper that demolished the alleged connection between economic condi tions and lynchings in rapers data raper had the misfortune of stopping his anal ysis in 1929 after the great depression hit the price of cotton plummeted and economic condi tions deteriorated yet lynchings continued to fall the correlation disappeared altogether when more years of data were added

5548957 we know that people have concerns about increasing rates we understand that and thats completely natural
5548958 what were looking forward to is the rate hearing process where all of the facts are on the table and everyone has the opportunity to express an opinion or any concern that they might have but again well depend on the regulator to make a decision about what the appropriate rates are in the future i think the regulatory process will show that those rates are primarily driven by increasing fuel costs that we need to recover in order to run our business successfully
5548959 thats an opinion among thousands of pages of evidence that are filed as part of the rate case and i think that the regulator will review all of the facts in september and will clearly see that the facts require us to have a rate increase to pay the cost of fuel
5548960 unlike oil companies the electricity companies in this country and across north america have real opportunities to change and move to a more renewable format for generating that electricity and thats exactly what im here to do

5548986 see it as a long term investment part of real estate for them is owning a piece of new york
5548987 the flatiron is expensive but with the cheap dollar it made sense to increase our share
5548988 the stability of the new york real estate market is unique this current crisis will pass and the dollar will re establish itself we are confident
5548989 this isnt just about the dollar the strongest driver is that investors are looking for geographical diversification the same situation played out on wall street about 10 to 15 years ago
5548990 european companies are very much conscious of the potential windfall you buy cheap now with the belief that in 10 years the currency will have rebounded
5548991 in terms of infrastructure the u s is an emerging market
5548992 the difference between the u s and europe is that the u s has stellar science and a rapid rate of innovation and transferring that technology to the market for commercial purposes
5548993 they could save 8 000 a car by building in the u s
5548994 the market has changed it will be a much bigger market for the kind of small car with advanced technology that the europeans are so good at making
5548995 its not just that american assets are cheaper the untold story here is that foreign investors are no longer willing to finance american debt
5548996 if you were to look at america inc as a company its like owning a company and you own a smaller and smaller fraction of it so the fraction of america inc owned by americans is diminishing
5548997 because the focus right now is the weakness of the american economy and anything to keep our economy going is welcome
5548998 our goal is to see a crowd of 75 000 people at obamas nomination speech holding their hands above their heads fingers laced together in support of a new direction for this country a renewed hope and acceptance of responsibility for our future
5548999 we thought lets try and start a movement where even while walking down the street people would hold up the o and you would know that they were for obama
5549000 you interlace your hands in a circle the interlacing being a symbol of different types of people coming together and the circle a symbol of unity

5549041 too much free stuff isnt good for you theres a reason why free stuff is free
5549042 the same person who constantly screams they arent afraid to die will cry like a baby and beg for their life the instant they are shot
5549043 muhammad ali wouldve destroyed mike tyson ali was too clever for tyson
5549044 if you dont stand for something you will fall for anything so i dont care what it is just believe in something
5549045 you will learn alot more if you play dumb people always want to believe they are smarter than you so when you play dumb they wont necessarily view you as a threat

5549052 my husband has been ill and i too have had had health issues
5549053 obama tem muito em comum com s rgio os dois t m terra sob as unhas
5549054 s rgio disse uma vez que o medo um mau conselheiro e algum tempo depois obama afirmou em um discurso que o medo d maus conselhos os dois tinham pontos de vista muito parecidos sobre como o medo pode afetar o julgamento
5549055 s rgio queria entender o mal e n o perdo lo ou venc lo como o presidente george w bush prega
5549056 ningu m esteve em todos este lugares violentos durante tantas guerras a experi ncia de s rgio nica
5549057 we were listening to the piece about cindy mccain on npr all things considered and it just struck us very hard
5549058 im an only child my father was a cowboy and he really loved me very much but i think he wanted a son occasionally
5549059 im angry it makes me feel like a nonperson kind of
5549060 i saw him at christmas and birthdays and he provided money for school clothes and he called occasionally
5549061 what she found in town on the day of or the day before or the day after his funeral was that the credit card didnt work anymore
5549062 the fact that weve never been recognized and then cindy has to put such a fine point on it by saying something thats not true recently again and again its just very very hurtful
5549063 im not the candidate ive never been front and center i do the things i enjoy and that are important to me and i do them in the way i like to do them
5549064 she was an heiress who was marrying and she was very young at the time
5549065 an old military guy who didnt have a job and went to work for the father in law right after they got married
5549066 this is a privacy issue my husband is the candidate
5549067 the federal financial disclosure form says things like well are you worth somewhere between 1 million and 100 million
5549068 in her case it doesnt tell us much because family businesses dont have to be valued and hensley is a family business
5549069 lyndon johnson was married to a very rich woman in the broadcasting business well that has a little bit of political effect and that is a business with a lot of political interests and beer is a business with a lot of political interests too beer is affected by all kinds of legal questions
5549070 shes very very hands on with comforting the parents who are anxious and perhaps shows them pictures of her own daughter
5549071 because of the regulations we have in place its safer than riding your bicycle down the road
5549072 but when you finally get here you think about the moments youre not proud of that didnt go well in your life and it shows anyone can come back im proud of what ive done
5549073 what a great team we had here and with only three riders participating
5549074 i dont know if thats ever been done with three riders
5549075 they took some bone out of my hip and stuck it in there with a little wire i was back riding in three months its never bothered me since
5549076 the most effective way to ensure that hoosiers will continue to have access to clean affordable energy is to invest in new technologies that use our own resources like coal which is abundant in indiana
5549077 this tax credit will add gasified coal power to other sources of homegrown energy like biodiesel and ethanol that provide good jobs for hoosier workers while protecting americas air and water
5549078 strengthening is expected tonight and tuesday and fay is forecast to be at or near hurricane strength winds of 119 kilometers or 74 miles per hour as it approaches the southwestern coast of florida
5549079 tornadoes are likely in some areas tonight monday and tomorrow and maybe even into the next few days
5549080 even though this storm doesnt look like its very dangerous and people will say its just a tropical storm or its just a category one hurricane our experience with florida tells us that if were not careful we will lose people
5549081 we have amazing waves today something not seen very often on this beaches its a perfect day
5549082 i dont think that they mean to treat you differently its just something that happens
5549083 we need to do a major education effort aimed at the public because the stigma with mental illness is clearly clearly out there
5549084 in some ways mental illness is the final frontier of socially acceptable discrimination
5549085 these figures show clearly the insidious stigma still associated with mental health and mental illness
5549086 these are the attitudes that have kept mental health on the outside for far too long
5549087 meanwhile less than half of canadians think people struggling with drug and alcohol addictions have a mental illness says the report
5549088 as im kind of six songs deep im kind of like oh ok
5549089 now that this sort of has this pattern or this trend ive written in and ive touched on 50s 60s 70s i thought ok lets see what we can come up with that has an 80s flair to it
5549090 i really wanted to be a part of it but i also knew that i really needed to focus
5549091 i had to make a choice because i wanted to make sure that all of my attention would be put towards one thing
5549092 we beg to withhold participation from such a monitoring team as of now we do not think it will help fight illegal logging
5549093 this is really a slap in the face to the community
5549094 as real estate values have gone up and different folks have moved into the county theres a different sense of property rights
5549095 theres a learning curve that has to take place with new owners about the historic use of the lands while also respecting that these are private properties
5549096 in every single town from sausalito to novato these historical uses exist many people consider them to be public but all it takes is a change of owner to make an abrupt change depending on the attitude of the property owner
5549097 humility does not consist of handsome people trying to believe that they are ugly and clever people trying to believe they are fools
5549098 once booming music scene of las vegas is nearly gone
5549099 now if you wanna see some cheap music you have to find something at the park or fight the crowds down at fremont street east to see live music
5549100 obama was caught red handed in his attempt to deceive the american people when nrlc released these official documents
5549101 i have said repeatedly that i would have been completely in fully in support of the federal bill that everybody supported which was to say that you should provide assistance to any infant that was born even if it was as a consequence of an induced abortion that was not the bill that was presented at the state level what that bill also was doing was trying to undermine roe v wade
5549102 so for people to suggest that i somehow in favor of withholding life saving support from an infant born alive is ridiculous it defies commonsense and it defies imagination and for people to keep on pushing this is offensive and its an example of the kind of politics we have to get beyond its one thing for people to disagree with me about the issue of choice its another thing for people to out and out misrepresent my positions repeatedly even after they know that theyre wrong
5549103 we now challenge obama to either declare the two 2003 documents to be forgeries and call for an official investigation or else apologize for his four years of misrepresentation on the issue of babies who are born alive during abortions and forcalling us liars
5549104 this negro will do just about anything to avoid paying that woman her money
5549105 theres no telling how long that woman has been cheating on me
5549106 of course jamal is what in the world would make you think that hes not
5549107 thats what i heard uncle kaliq tell the man dressed in the black robe
5549108 yeah daddy can we please then i can go home and tell mommy that she is right you are my dad the best daddy in the whole wide world
5549109 your child didnt buy that room your child doesnt pay rent you are trying to keep your child from going to jail
5549110 one of the challenges black folk face is supporting each other

5549113 barack obama is going to have to win this thing or lose this thing on his own
5549114 we analysts have had to pretend to know what they are thinking
5549115 and so weve had to get by without really knowing what were talking about
5549116 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
5549117 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
5549118 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
5549119 wheels 21 speed mountain bike great condition good bike for teen or tween 50 call 760 635 3604
5549120 the bottom line from our perspective is that the player has a contract which our rules obligate him to respect
5549121 our rules dont recognize a player or his new team being able to buy the way out of an existing contract its not a scenario that our existing rules contemplate or allow
5549122 we should forget emotions and we should start a new life with a transfer agreement in place
5549123 but without such an agreement if somebody will break the moratorium then it will be everybody could take any player and it will not be good for hockey
5549124 the khl shouldnt need a moratorium to adhere to a policy of respecting legal and binding contractual commitments
5549125 dull people know that clever people are cleverer than they are but they do not know why the nekulturny uncultured colonel ralph peters a former us military intelligence analyst is impressed by the tactical success of russian arms in georgia but cannot fathom the end game to which these tactics contribute he writes the new reality is that a nuclear cash rich and energy blessed russia doesnt really worry too much whether its long term future is bleak given problems with muslim minorities poor life expectancy rates and a declining population instead in the here and now it has a window of opportunity to reclaim prestige and weaken its adversaries precisely the opposite is true like a good chess player putin has the end game in mind as he fights for control of the board in the early stages of the game demographics stand at the center of putins calculation and russians are the principal interest that the russian federation has in its so called near abroad the desire of a few hundred thousand abkhazians and south ossetians to remain in the russian federation rather than georgia may seem trivial but moscow is setting a precedent that will apply to tens of millions of prospective citizens of the federation most controversially in ukraine

5549127 heroine girl who is perfectly charming to live with in a book
5549128 i admire addicts in a world where everybody is waiting for some bline random disaster or some sudden disease the addict has the comfort of knowing what will most likely wait for him down the road hes taken some control over his ultimate fate and his addiction keeps the cause of death from being a total surprise
5549129 the book can produce an addiction as fierce as heroin or nicotine forcing us to spend much of our lives like junkies in book shops and libraries those literary counterparts to the opium den
5549130 just cause you got the monkey off your back doesnt mean the circus has left town
5549131 i feel that any form of so called psychotherapy is strongly contraindicated for addicts the question why did you start using narcotics in the first place should never be asked it is quite as irrelevant to treatment as it would be to ask a malarial patient why he went to a malarial area
5549132 the dead drug leaves a ghost behind at certain hours it haunts the house
5549133 i had someone at the houston police station shoot me with heroin so i could do a story about it the experience was a special kind of hell i came out understanding full well how one could be addicted to smack and quickly
5549134 heroin cocaine ecstasy and anything i could get my hands on at that point i had over eighteen million dollars in the bank and i still couldnt find happiness in being rich or famous

5549136 since this is the case she will have more men who desire and compete for her love and affection which offends the male ego this scenario leads to amongst other things jealousy and insecurity it hardly becomes about the woman or relationship anymore just some evil nightmare which her one and only man now has this leads to paranoia which leads to endless arguments which leads to mental and sometimes physical abuse which leads to an emotional catastrophe which eventually leads to the man eventually coming to the realization that a beautiful woman is not worth it and too much to deal with the woman can no longer deal with the man and the breakup follows and lets not get started on the married man who cannot wife her only keep her or the somewhat wealthy man who seems to think that he can buy her love
5549137 this is the state of the city address its not an naacp convention
5549138 we use it the way we want to use it
5549139 how are we supposed to move forward if we keep using words that bring back that pain
5549140 how can they decide that all 100 that died and all that was burned and everything all the survivors that their lives are only worth 10 million
5549141 were we perfect absolutely not weve had missteps and those are the lessons learned it was over the last few years that we were able to incorporate all of the lessons learned that we have throughout this investigation
5549142 unfortunately a lot of them are not going to be able to be answered in the immediate future
5549143 i dont think no 1 were ever going to put the suspicions to bed
5549144 his only response was that he wanted to hang out there which was not a very compelling reason

5549147 it is considered too sexy for us its not good for viewers in malaysia

5549149 the line was minimal before 11 p m and nonexistent afterward
5549150 the cover was 20 and the warm up dj was received better than madden
5549151 clearly these are the most popular people to step foot in the white house in some time
5549152 there are a lot of people who are not here tonight but thanks to everyone who did make it
5549153 out of all your years you look your most beautiful now
5549154 you could hear her going on and on because she was standing right behind the stage curtain
5549155 she leaves us waiting and everyone is sitting there complaining and then she comes out and doesnt say a word about it
5549156 she didnt even say hello she got right into her script she acted so cold towards everyone
5549157 i have a finely tuned bulls detector and im not the sort of person who trusts very easily
5549158 but its not specifically an actor thing anyone in the public eye has that
5549159 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
5549160 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
5549161 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
5549162 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
5549163 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
5549164 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
5549165 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
5549166 uranium mining has taken our country away from us and destroyed it mining and the millions of dollars in royalties have not improved our quality of life
5549167 the greatest minds in the nuclear establishment have been searching for an answer to the radioactive waste problem for fifty years and theyve finally got one haul it down a dirt road and dump it on an indian reservation
5549168 for eight years in the white house every weapons proliferation problem we dealt with was connected to a civilian reactor program and if we ever got to the point where we wanted to use nuclear reactors to back out a lot of coal then wed have to put them in so many places wed run that proliferation risk right off the reasonability scale

5549174 id have to say that monckton won the debate he came across as more prepared and had answers at his fingertips whereas richard appeared to verbally stumble on occasion
5549175 i got the impression that littlemore was engaging in the debate totally unprepared
5549176 in hindsight i played perfectly into the hands of monckton and his happy radio host roy green who share the same goal not to win an argument about global warming science but merely to show that there still is an argument
5549177 oh my this is very confusing no wonder the government says its too early to take action
5549178 americans need to get over the political bigotry that there are only two parties
5549179 must be astonishing to canadians who have a multiparty system
5549180 mainstream political parties can essentially cooperate in failing to even attempt to solve problems faced by a majority of citizens usually because they have been funded and supported in other ways by large corporations
5549181 naders presidential campaign as with other similar past campaigns by independents and third parties serve the purpose of educating people about the huge gaps in the mainstream parties platforms
5549182 not stupid theyve developed a highly proficient way of censoring themselves
5549183 until these loopholes are closed you will continue to see regular dishonest unethical secretive unrepresentative and wasteful actions by governments and corporations
5549184 hello americans cut the crap stop making excuses and take over
5549185 protest the corporate control over our political system and to call for opening the presidential debates
5549186 free us from our addiction to oil from 4 00 plus per gallon gas
5549187 there is no time to waste we want a better future we demand a better future we the american people are no longer asking
5549188 the free us ad takes a different tone than our previous efforts
5549189 this ad issues a direct and compelling challenge and juxtaposes the stark imagery of our addiction to fossil fuels with the earnest faces of the american people who are calling for answers and solutions now it takes the call for renewable energy from a request to a demand
5549190 the conventions are about coming together to choose the ideas and the people who will lead us forward
5549191 the next american president has the inescapable responsibility to move our country away from fossil fuels and toward clean sustainable energy sources our economic and environmental futures depend on it and the american people are demanding it
5549192 you could do a lot worse than both of these guys

5549197 how else do you get that message across the message of god without the media
5549198 i knew it was my mission to tell all these media types about the many ministries at saddleback and how these ministries made saddleback such an intensely personal church even with 35 000 people attending every weekend
5549199 pat robertson et al managed over time to create a situation in which high profile evangelicals came to be seen as wholly owned subsidiaries of the republican party
5549200 it reminds me some of a throwback to the billy graham days since graham made some effort to be seen as bi partisan at least in form
5549201 specifically warrens flock is suburban and such folks as he says have interests beyond the limited agenda of the past
5549202 so long as warren operates as a broker i would expect two things to happen more inclusion i e more people comfortable in that flock and greater moderation by virtue of that greater inclusion
5549203 i know that its not about us and its absolutely not about rick
5549204 it might be misperceived by the world that way because the world understands things in a tangible fashion predominately
5549205 this is just incorrect i was never his agent or manager
5549206 theyre trying to take my salary and say i was the agent i wasnt

5549212 significant progress has been made but we will not be content until every vestige of ira structures has gone
5549213 i dont believe ireland has seen its last ira murder
5549214 i dont think my mind set has changed any since april
5549215 more consistent pound the zone if you can show guys youre ahead in the zone theyre going to swing at pitches early in the count that arent necessarily good pitches to hit i was able to do that tonight
5549216 ill be honest i didnt know a lot about him before i got here
5549217 but its pretty obvious to me after being here that hes one of the better pitchers in this league
5549218 thats part of my job driving in runs and youve got to have guys on base to do that
5549219 its a testament to those guys im just trying to be a complement to the puzzle
5549220 probably the biggest struggle ive had all season with my stuff
5549221 my fastball command was not there i walked a lot of guys it might have been the toughest outing of the season for me as far as laboring i had to work hard to get through five and get a couple more
5549222 weve been coming back all year long and so were expecting one of those games
5549223 youre not going to win them all but obviously thats one of the better teams in the american league east and the american league for that matter theyve got a great bullpen and lester gave them a great start tonight
5549224 it is significant in the sense that there was semtex in the explosive charge it did not go off but there was semtex there where it came from i dont know
5549225 it is similar to devices that used to be used in the province by other groups
5549226 but when it the semtex was passed over to different groups how it came to be in their possession i dont know at this point in time
5549227 i dont know where the weaponry has come from for me it looks as if it came from old stocks
5549228 as far as i am aware it is the first time they have used semtex it does not appear to be new semtex so it does not raise a concern with me that they have a new supply of semtex
5549229 im not so sure with the reduction of police resources in the province and the removal of the army that the psni have the resources at this present time to deal with this escalation and if its not nipped in the bud very quickly it will get worse
5549230 i think if the police dont have the resources themselves they may need to bring the army back in for a short period

5549253 we cant drill our way of this situation but we will do everything we can to produce more domestic energy just two years ago i pushed for 8 3 million acres of drill sites in the gulf of mexico now that is done
5549254 any credible domestic energy policy must reduce our dependence on foreign oil by at least 30 percent in the next 10 years
5549255 he understands the issues and is interested and excited by the work we are doing to educate and involve the people

5549271 what does it matter if mccain had an affair its common knowledge that obama had an affair as well
5549272 today prof clayson denounces the press for its religious reverence to obama he then tries to prove it by providing three examples
5549273 the bat thinkaboutit and mister t have apparently been living on the moon for a while and have been out of touch with events here on earth the fact that john mccain was fooling around with cindy while he was still married to carol is something that he admits
5549274 jeroze you are right on mccains affair i did not see the entire saddle back event i was watching the swimming
5549275 cross you kill me every week i cant help but think you read a different article than me each week because your generalizations of claysons intent and meaning behind is writing seams to be much different than what i read
5549276 i dont get it the title says it all now liberals everywhere are trying to say clayson did not learn these things
5549277 cire asks what does it matter if mccain had an affair
5549278 cross is your goal to be insulting to people because if it is you are surely reaching your goals
5549279 sorry cire i wont take you seriously anymore and please dont take what i just wrote seriously
5549280 if you watched that youtube video and thought they were being serious im beyond concerned
5549281 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
5549282 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
5549283 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
5549284 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
5549285 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
5549286 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5549287 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5549288 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5549289 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5549290 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5549291 sen obama made it clear that he was really going to get into the nuts and bolts of the kinds of questions oregonians are talking about and i think it has served him well in our state
5549292 im confident that once sen obama gets as well known in these larger states as he has in oregon he is going to see the same success elswhere
5549293 thats an all time high for optical scan usage in this nation
5549294 electronic system usage will go down in 2008 for the first time since we started collecting data in 1980
5549295 we studied these systems and all the systems in use in ohio and the most vulnerable to risk are the touch screen voting machines
5549296 there have been no votes lost just votes that are missed and hours later or days later recovered
5549297 we are in fact in compliance with the terms of the contracts
5549298 if theres a machine failure or a power outage or some kind of misprogramming with the machines it will enable people to keep voting
5549299 what has happened since florida 2000 is weve taken a problem that was a disaster for that election and made it exponentially worse
5549300 these machines cannot be trusted for the counting and recording of our votes
5549301 computer scientists around the country have demonstrated that in less than 60 seconds one of these machines can be broken into and can infect the entire system on which people are voting
5549302 touch screen voting machines have proven to be accurate reliable and secure time and time again
5549303 it is important to note that successful elections necessitate people processes and the technology all working together
5549304 anytime there has been a change in voting equipment there have been some some doubts and concerns which lessen over time due to familiarity with the new equipment
5549305 if all you have is the electronic memory you can reprint that electronic memory as many times as you want its going to say exactly the same thing and you wont know whether its right
5549306 more than a third of the voters in this country will be voting in an unverifiable way
5549307 without an audit without the ability to audit it will be unreliable and without paper record you cant really audit
5549308 this is the central act of democracy it is the basis for the all the legitimacy of our government and its actions we believe or at least want to believe that people are put in office by the will of the voters thats what you need to be able to verify
5549309 if this helps anyone out there who is in their middle aged years and has put off what they wanted to do because they thought they were too old or because they have a child and that they cant balance what they want to do with being a parent then thats great what ive done is show them that they can do it
5549310 it was thought that if youre getting to 16 17 or 18 youre getting to the end of your career dara has done a fantastic job in proving that you can continue to improve and that women can have children and get back into the sport she has gotten rid of a mythology in swimming that has been there for so long
5549311 we are not going to allow russia to draw a new line at those states that are not yet integrated into the trans atlantic structures
5549312 it didnt take the russian forces long to get into georgia
5549313 to clearly indicate that we are not accepting a new line
5549314 is a very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
5549315 this is not something that is just cost free nobody needs russian strategic aviation along americas coast
5549316 an explanation from the russians for why the russian president either wont or cant keep his word
5549317 it didnt take that long for the russian forces to get in and it really shouldnt take that long for them to get out
5549318 we hope that tomorrows decisions by nato will be balanced and that responsible forces in the west will give up the total cynicism that has been so evident which is pushing us back to the cold war era
5549319 we dont want to destroy the nato russia council but russias actions have called into question the premise of the nato russia relationship
5549320 this will make our wine less competitive in addition shut down shipping by pa wineries
5549321 theres good to have controls obviously we shouldnt be losing revenue its a law the revenue should be collected by the state the state needs the revenue
5549322 to the extent that it requires face to face transactions we believe it would keep it out of the hands of minors
5549323 as que le deseo lo mejor toda la felicidad y alegr a que conlleva tener ese certificado la alegr a de poder decirlo frente a todo el mundo que quieres a la persona frente a ti y que puedes unirte a ella de forma legal eso es muy importante
5549324 the u s mint buys direct from the refiners and this suspension of gold eagle sales may be an indication that the supply line is already backing up or that the mint expects that it will back up for the rest of the year i wonder who would give up physical metal at these prices and under these circumstances except distressed sellers the central banks are in a hunker down mode as far as i can determine and its the mines that supply the refiners so if the mint which buys from the refiners is having a difficult time locating metal what does that tell you i keep saying that we may get a surprising rubber band effect later in the year when the pre holiday festival season kicks off in september october it may happen sooner one of our indicators of approaching a bottom in gold is how many calls centennial precious metals gets from our u s based indian clientele heres a quote from my offices report to me at the end of the day today today was a good day there must have been an indian convention where someone was handing out usagold business cards that may give you a clue as to thinking in india proper and probably the rest of the asian rim
5549325 this has really created a hardship for me and my family
5549326 me and my family feel mr oliver should not get any good time in this matter
5549327 but i am required to follow the law and the law calls for a stayed sentence
5549328 make this guy a better citizen it seems like he has no regard for the law
5549329 he took a life and is getting off pretty easy
5549330 he was a batsman in top form but thats the way it goes in cricket

5549339 theyve been banged up real good and theyre starting to run out of games
5549340 maybe i should be worried but worrying is not going to do me any good besides the teams playing hard im not defending our record im just defending the effort i think this teams getting better
5549341 on the other side of this line everything is different
5549342 de slag moet een natuurlijke gracieuze beweging zijn maar u moet de club toch stevig vastpakken
5549343 may i suggest if there are five blokes to every girl we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa
5549344 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face
5549345 whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness

5549360 more consistent pound the zone if you can show guys youre ahead in the zone theyre going to swing at pitches early in the count that arent necessarily good pitches to hit i was able to do that tonight
5549361 ill be honest i didnt know a lot about him before i got here
5549362 but its pretty obvious to me after being here that hes one of the better pitchers in this league
5549363 thats part of my job driving in runs and youve got to have guys on base to do that
5549364 its a testament to those guys im just trying to be a complement to the puzzle

5549387 customs officials continued to monitor for the smuggling of bibles and other religious material into the country
5549388 religious texts published without authorization including bibles and qurans may be confiscated
5549389 i have spoken clearly candidly and consistently with chinas leaders about our deep concerns over religious freedom and human rights
5549390 and i have met repeatedly with chinese dissidents and religious believers the united states believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings
5549391 we firmly oppose any statements or deeds which use human rights religion and other issues to interfere with the internal affairs of other countries
5549392 keeps to the concept of putting peoples interest first and is devoted to maintaining and promoting basic rights and freedom of its citizens
5549393 chinese citizens enjoy freedom of religion in accordance with the law
5549394 were being inconvenienced a little but its nothing compared to what our brothers and sisters in china experience for their faith in jesus christ
5549395 because things always seemed to work out i would pay individuals to take us where we needed to go or i would be in a position to rent a vehicle to get from point a to point b there have been times though that events would have to be rescheduled because i had no transportation
5549396 cyrus does so much out of his own pocket to help others when it comes to reading and promoting the arts that i was glad to give something to him
5549397 next of kindredz is to help the people and helping begins with family he is like family to me and i know this will help to keep his mission going

5549399 the film changed my life and my way of thinking i decided to do whatever i could
5549400 when i learned of their problem i decided to do something at least help them dig wells in their area which would provide a perennial source of water
5549401 when she expressed a desire to help people in rural maharashtra we decided to encourage her
5549402 she always had an inclination toward social service and we decided to cultivate it
5549403 the drive began in july and by the end of the month a total of 2600 was collected this money was sufficient to dig a bore well as well as fit an electric pump
5549404 i want to build rural maharashtra i want medical attention to be available to everyone and make physicians available in every village in rural maharashtra
5549405 the democrats talk of tolerance but in reality the only tolerance they ever exhibit is for their own intellectual arrogance and they dont have tolerance for my culture
5549406 they think were a bunch of hillbilly heathens who go out and burn crosses and do crazy bullshit
5549407 they dont give a f if were with them or not because it doesnt matter the f ing republicans have stolen the individual liberties thing and thats why the gun thing is such a big deal
5549408 i got a call from them right after johnny got out i never heard back
5549409 they have to be careful sometimes they remind me of another bunch from chicago the blues brothers they seem to think theyre on a mission from god
5549410 if thats how he runs his campaign he is going to lose id rather bet on those who voted before when he stands up and says that im gonna get 30 per cent more black voters im gonna get 30 per cent more of my people to turn out for me what is joe six pack thinking
5549411 he should say im a black guy im not gonna take the michael jackson treatment but the problems of south side chicago are the same problems of the appalachian mountains big sonsofabitches are kicking the little sonsofabitches in the ass now im one of the little sonsofabitches so im pissed off inside every rural republican is a rural democrat begging to get out but we always trip over our johnsons
5549412 think this election will be won on the internet but here at 5 30 in the afternoon they dont go on the goddamn internet they go watch the andy griffith show a 1960s sitcom
5549413 white people in the south and throughout the appalachians love black culture i mean southern style cooking is black food everything i eat is fried your swing vote in the appalachians comes down to common sense thinking people who have strong faith and what barack obama needs to do is embrace his culture because we like his culture but nobody knows anything about him over 10 per cent of the rednecks out here and im a redneck think hes a muslim cause nobodys ever told em any different
5549414 im pretty sure i aint a queer and ive never had queer thoughts
5549415 but god loves them queers every bit that he loves the republicans
5549416 its their mouth they can use it to haul coal if they want to
5549417 the gallant kids from around here who lost their lives
5549418 it is the same exact people its the same f ing bunch of fight sing drink pray people who are over there who are over here in these mountains
5549419 youre damn right theyre on hadrians side of the wall is where they are and they want the scots irish vote well its true its f ing genes its who we are as a people well say f you to bush longshanks or maggie thatcher f any of em
5549420 bitterly clinging to their religion guns and antithapy towards others
5549421 im here to advocate for sen obama that we get a democrat into the wh
5549422 making up your mind questions to consider before the next election
5549423 heres what i want you to do between now and election
5549424 dont just look at issues look at character issues are important but you also have to look at character
5549425 theyre saying im totally self sufficient in myself and nobodys self sufficient enough to be president its too big a job
5549426 rick warren is at the forefront of a kind of younger generation of evangelical protestant leaders who want to have a christian public presence in the culture but who are less tied to the republican politics of their predecessors
5549427 theyre values oriented guys but less convinced that either their own principles or the best politics lies in a total commitment to the republican party
5549428 we are one of those people that make over 250 000 a year and i dont agree that that makes us rich
5549429 even with that kind of income we struggle to pay everything we have gotten ourselves into
5549430 im pretty much a dyed in the wool republican and i was a marine what he went through for five years you gotta hand that to him
5549431 i mean come on whoever buys into that they gotta have a screw loose
5549432 just stay in the senate stay busy learn more foreign policy and come back in ten years obama and i betcha id vote for you
5549433 hes as genuine as can be its just hes a green apple hanging on the tree and mccain is a ripe red apple ready to be picked obama just needs to ripen some more
5549434 barack obama is going to get the same percentage of the religious vote that john kerry and al gore got
5549435 thats christian identity politics and im sure it has some influence but i dont think at the end of the day its the deciding factor
5549436 jimmy carter could have come in here and sounded much more comfortable with his faith but people having seen a jimmy carter presidency would not vote for him just because theyre likely to see him in heaven
5549437 study all the different candidates at every different level you need to register to vote and then you need to vote
5549438 when i hear people say i dont like either of the candidates im just not going to vote i want to say to them well then you need to move to another country because people died for that vote
5549439 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
5549440 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
5549441 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
5549442 john mccain is going to own the george bush economy around his neck in this election he was central to its architecture he was one of its fiercest defenders in america florida has lost more jobs over the last year than any other state in the country
5549443 it doesnt take much if our supporters are turning out at a rate of 74 percent 75 percent 78 percent and mccains are turning out at 68 70 72 that doesnt seem like a big deal but it is the whole ball game
5549444 bush had an advantage over kerry because of their intensity we think mccain is going to have trouble replicating bush in 2004
5549445 we dont take florida for granted but we do have a good history here even though were outnumbered in this state our voter turnout effort has been extremely good in florida
5549446 florida once again is the epicenter of the political universe were very confident that florida continues to trend as republican going back to jeb bush mel martinez charlie crist of course the president bush elections weve got a good mature organization on the ground
5549447 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
5549448 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder
5549449 since man lives by the permission of physical geography it is his fate to be divided by mountains rivers and seas into groups that develop in semi isolation their diverging languages and creeds their climatically conditioned features customs and dress

5549452 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind

5549455 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
5549456 supports privatization tax cuts and government spending cuts and opposes laws that limit spending by non party organizations during election campaigns
5549457 in order to attract votes the harper government has combined tax cuts with big spending the effect being to suck the treasury dry
5549458 we must pull together and support the candidate for president who is on our side barack obama this is at the core of what it means to be a member of our union
5549459 theres not a single good reason for any worker especially any union member to vote against barack obama
5549460 theres only one really bad reason to vote against him because hes not white
5549461 were going straight at our people and talking to them about the differences between mccain and obama and the fact that race could be an issue you go straight at it
5549462 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5549463 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5549464 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5549465 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5549466 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5549467 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5549468 many in the christian right tend to get their information
5549469 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
5549470 you probably dont throw that one i think he would agree
5549471 i had the gun on him before he turned around and said youve had it
5549472 dial 911 and dont attempt to throw the phone at me or do anything bad or ill just shoot you
5549473 documents that contain information about the udis decision making processes on a range of selected issues the documents explain how decisions are reached but they also contain information on internal procedures within the udi
5549474 there was a high degree of uncertainty initially we had an internal discussion as to how we were going to publish the documents containing the procedures regarding asylum applications some members argued that publishing this information on the internet would be viewed as a step by step guide to get political asylum
5549475 criteria used to determine whether an applicant is credible or not will not be made available i feel that we have reached a decision that has broad support within the organization not everyone agrees but the majority do
5549476 our experience is that the asylum seekers are very well informed about which criteria we use
5549477 our main concern in a lot of cases is to establish whether an asylum seeker is a member of a political organization or whether hes from a certain region of a country how we go about in determining this will not be revealed we are not going to disclose how we verify this type of information
5549478 since this is a beta release applications developed with it may not quite be compatible with devices running the final android 1 0
5549479 will give developers a chance to build polished applications once hardware is available
5549480 due to significant api changes in the upstream open source project and due to the timeline of getting certain bluetooth profile implementations certified a comprehensive bluetooth api will not be possible or present in android 1 0
5549481 due to the security risks inherent in accepting arbitrary data from outside the device the data messaging facility of the gtalkservice will not be present in android 1 0
5549482 we know that these changes will affect many developers who have worked with the prior early looks at the sdk and we are very sorry for the resulting inconvenience
5549483 we look forward to the possibility of restoring some or all of this functionality in a later version of the android platform

5549494 in this time of economic uncertainty business needs to see the federal government easing bureaucratic burden
5549495 if retailers were well informed and educated about their consumer law requirements many disputes would be avoided
5549496 as i have done nothing wrong in connection with any of the matters that are the subject of the inquiry i expect to be exonerated
5549497 in the near future i would love to have a talk about new challenges and opportunities in education and training and the provision of safe and fair workplaces in nsw
5549498 he has on many occasions stated his innocence hes just repeating that
5549499 its important that we get together now to prepare for what will possibly be our toughest qualifier for the world cup because we go into the unknown against uzbekistan
5549500 were going into an environment that were not used to and they had an extremely good qualifying round previously so its going to be tough
5549501 ever since guus hiddink came in and completely changed our formations and got us thinking about different styles weve learned to adapt to anything
5549502 and the uzbeks have got us thinking were going to have to work on our system and our system only and make sure that we can adapt in the first five minutes to whatever gets thrown at us
5549503 the next few games arent about winning necessarily its about a good performance and preparing for uzbekistan which inevitably is the most important game
5549504 we saw a little bit of them at the asian cup last year they looked a pretty good side
5549505 theyre going to be a very very difficult game for us away thats why these two friendly games are important because we can get together as a squad and get some game time under our belts
5549506 they both came up really well its a positive outlook for both people
5549507 archie was a bit down when he got back but hes progressing well he progressed in the last 24 hours so he looks like hes really a good chance to play against newcastle and nick ward is the same
5549508 in view of certain developments a decision has been taken that fiji will not attend the forum meeting in niue
5549509 this regrettable and unfortunate situation of fiji not participating in the forum meeting in niue arises because of the decision taken by the government of new zealand
5549510 his attendance was expected and there is no reason he should not do so
5549511 commodore bainimarama had the opportunity through his attendance at the forum to explain this decision in person to pacific leaders
5549512 fiji will still be despite his absence a major feature of leaders discussions in niue
5549513 that commodore bainimarama should meet his solemn commitment to hold elections by march next year
5549514 he is trying it on here the bottom line is that there is no forum event in new zealand
5549515 trying to blame new zealand for something that doesnt exist is nonsense
5549516 some pacific countries have arranged to have bilateral meetings here that is entirely their business
5549517 the pacific forum needs to understand that we in fiji will decide what is in our national interest in the short and the long term
5549518 it is very well for the new zealand prime minister to call for unity of the pacific forum on the issue of elections in fiji
5549519 this so called unity cannot be against fiji as that is neither achievable nor acceptable
5549520 most if not all pacific island leaders are against fiji being further victimised by australia and new zealand even if they may not say so openly in niue
5549521 according to the independent electoral commission it will take at least another 12 to 15 months to prepare for election
5549522 that is why i have said that the most practical date for the general election under the new system cannot possibly be march 2009
5549523 the company remains cautious of the current retail environment and the state of consumer demand in the lead up to the pivotal christmas period funtastic said the style hunters
5549524 given the scope of the review we believe it is crucial that we consult widely with our stakeholders in south australia and tasmania so that we can understand and proactively address any questions they have
5549525 we have begun this work at a high level already and we will now continue it at all levels
5549526 while it would be premature to speculate on the outcome of either feasibility study nyrstar firmly believes in the strategic merits of the review which at its core aims to lock in a long and vibrant future for both sites
5549527 i would suggest that the decisions been made and come december of this year workers will be informed that within 12 months there will be shift of that zinc production here in pirie it will go to hobart
5549528 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
5549529 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
5549530 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
5549531 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
5549532 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
5549533 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
5549534 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
5549535 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
5549536 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
5549537 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
5549538 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
5549539 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
5549540 every four years you usually get to look at these guys try to go native think of president bush in his brush clearing outfit
5549541 but if youre president the day job does involve a suit and it can be awkward when youre not in work clothes
5549542 everyone knows how fast a picture can go from local novelty to worldwide laughingstock
5549543 it shows hes not trying to be like everyone else its part of the visual message that hes crafting in an odd little way it adds to the not pandering in a conservative middle america suit like a 50 year old tax lawyer wears
5549544 it would be inappropriate if mccain looked as stylish as obama he has a different physique hes a different age and hes much more conservative
5549545 he does have occasional fun with a wider flashy tie
5549546 not all senators can wear that but it looks right on him
5549547 you could put baracks head on johns body and say hes gained a little weight but you wouldnt notice he was in different clothes
5549548 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
5549549 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
5549550 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
5549551 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
5549552 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
5549553 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
5549554 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
5549555 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
5549556 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
5549557 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
5549558 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
5549559 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5549560 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5549561 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5549562 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5549563 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5549564 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5549565 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5549566 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5549567 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5549568 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5549569 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5549570 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5549571 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5549572 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5549573 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5549574 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5549575 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5549576 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5549577 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5549578 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5549579 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5549580 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5549581 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5549582 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5549583 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5549584 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5549585 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5549586 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5549587 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5549588 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5549589 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5549590 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
5549591 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
5549592 the problem of maximizing power from sunlight has been known for at least 30 years and is primarily one of physical limitations not engineering technology
5549593 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
5549594 as far as i know edwards canceled all his public appearances for the foreseeable future
5549595 this labor day festival was not built around john edwards
5549596 a new vision for the 21st century affordable quality healthy care for everyone wages that can support families freedom to join unions without intimidation and retirement security as well
5549597 the dress was tight on her bosom and loose at the hips and on the other woman loose on the bosom and tight on the hips
5549598 sekolah mau bubarin eskul jurnalistik kita itu artinya koran sekolah kita bakalan tamat
5549599 the art of good business is being a good middleman putting people together
5549600 from very early on dr nelson has sided with the spirits industry in opposing this measure
5549601 but from the early evidence that we have from the tax office this measure is being successful
5549602 dr nelson needs to explain what impact his opposition to this measure will have on the health of young people and on the sorts of outcomes that we are trying to achieve for the community in making sure that young people have a healthier approach in the way they consume alcohol
5549603 dr nelson is taking i think a big risk by opposing a measure which could have a significant impact on the health of the next generation
5549604 i think our first step should be to get the united states of america fully engaged
5549605 what is heartening on that question is that both candidates republican and democrat have indicated that they will be moving on this and with an ambitious set of targets
5549606 whether or not the us would be able to get the treaty through congress if in every other respect it acts in accordance to achieve those goals through sovereign actions that in itself would be an incredibly good thing
5549607 i think our officials are working very closely on this to make sure there are no barriers towards linking these schemes and based on my advice there are none
5549608 an area of endeavour for us is what we do domestically on the renewable energy front
5549609 the advice i have heard from our officials is that the emissions trading scheme proposed in the green paper of the australian government is not incompatible with ours at all
5549610 were all in this together and the people of pakistan and the government of pakistan know that
5549611 so were confident that while we certainly all have more to do when it comes to fighting terrorism the government of pakistan will continue in the effort
5549612 while this political process is underway we certainly expect theyll keep up their fight against terrorists and extremists and because of what i just said this is a fight that they are in as well
5549613 thats what the prime minister said when he was in washington
5549614 president bush is committed to a strong pakistan that continues its efforts to strengthen democracy and fight terror
5549615 president bush appreciates president musharrafs efforts in the democratic transition of pakistan as well as his commitment to fighting al qaeda and extremist groups
5549616 president bush looks forward to working with the government of pakistan on the economic political and security challenges they face
5549617 the extremist ideology is one that has been out there and among these groups for many years
5549618 lets be very clear about where this started and thats with the extremists
5549619 a friend to the united states and one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism
5549620 we will continue to work with the pakistani government and political leaders and urge them to redouble their focus on pakistans future and its most urgent needs including stemming the growth of extremism
5549621 the art of good business is being a good middleman putting people together
5549622 i then looked down to reach my bag and saw that it was not there i then had a nervous breakdown i didnt know whether to scream or cry or run there were so many things in my bag
5549623 as a result of this incident i have been left feeling that my privacy has been invaded i am upset at the theft of my belongings as a lot of them had significant personal and sentimental meaning to me and my family
5549624 i will be supporting the removal of abortion from the crimes act i think thats the right thing its the right thing in terms of public policy
5549625 but i would stress that the proposal we are putting to the parliament is one that would be consistent and fully consistent with current clinical practice
5549626 for women i think its a crucial matter for them that a personal decision theyve made about themselves and their body is subject to action under the criminal code
5549627 removing this from the criminal code is important for women it is something that many women and many womens organisations have fought long and hard for so i think its important
5549628 today the rights of the unborn children have been forsaken by the victorian government this is a very very sad event
5549629 i dont want women any more to feel that this is some kind of terrible shame
5549630 interestingly this morning all the emails that i have been getting are from women in my age group who underwent similar sort of circumstances themselves and i think its really important to bring down that taboo
5549631 if it is that the bill reflects the second of the third options as reflected in the paper then i will oppose it
5549632 we heard some rumours and were hoping for something better but obviously this is a historical opportunity and hopefully this government will act in the right and compassionate way for women
5549633 strengthening is expected tonight and tuesday and fay is forecast to be at or near hurricane strength winds of 119 kilometers or 74 miles per hour as it approaches the southwestern coast of florida
5549634 tornadoes are likely in some areas tonight monday and tomorrow and maybe even into the next few days
5549635 even though this storm doesnt look like its very dangerous and people will say its just a tropical storm or its just a category one hurricane our experience with florida tells us that if were not careful we will lose people
5549636 we have amazing waves today something not seen very often on this beaches its a perfect day
5549637 the rba at its september meeting should really take account of the impact of the slowing domestic demand and the particularly severe impact it has had on small business
5549638 we believe that now a rate cut is required in september and further rate cuts are required before the end of the year
5549639 the survey shows that the domestic economic slowdown is hitting small business harder and more systematically than any other sector
5549640 we believe that with competition that will in fact happen
5549641 the capacity for the commercial banks to hold out against that is not strong in a competitive banking environment
5549642 president bush looks forward to working with the government of pakistan on the economic political and security challenges they face
5549643 to be approaching hurricane strength in florida keys and to become a hurricane before it reached the florida peninsula
5549644 it overturned as it was crossing a bridge on the river glace
5549645 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
5549646 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
5549647 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
5549648 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
5549649 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
5549650 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
5549651 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
5549652 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
5549653 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming
5549654 obama mccain discussion with megachurch minister warren has auburn producer director
5549655 it was beautiful i miss the canopy it was a lot of shade and brought the electrical bill down
5549656 it took our power for about 10 days crushed the roof it wasnt fun we roughed it out with cold showers and cold food
5549657 anytime we do an overhead to underground conversion we do have to dig up the property so in some instances we would have to remove trees
5549658 for instance last week when we had that storm come through we had quite a few people without power most of that was caused by downed lines or trees in the lines
5549659 if it works thats a great idea and its an even better idea if people when you see the road is flooded they dont go real fast because that causes a wake
5549660 all the way from the river all the way up to the front door into the house
5549661 it is a 50 000 gallon capacity pump station the one we had down in landon avenue was a quarter of that it is a very major facility functioning down in san marco we have every confidence its going to work exactly the way it is intended to
5549662 ive been in the building the longest on the bottom floor no doubt ive been through hurricanes and tornadoes back and forth doesnt bother me a bit
5549663 at 13 or 14 you can count on one hand the amount of time theyve been able to swing
5549664 if they were going to put additional resources to this it would mean parks get neglected in total and we didnt want that and no one would win with that
5549665 people have been calling here today asking about winds and overpasses and bridges and the answer is there is no wind threshold to remove vehicles from bridges it is up to local law enforcement
5549666 a lot of these bridges are on evacuation routes so you cant shut down a major bridge until people are out of there
5549667 so your standard passenger car is lowest on the priority list
5549668 it would take a major major storm for all vehicles to be restricted from our bridges
5549669 one of the biggest problems weve run into in the past is people evacuating who dont need to
5549670 because what happens is if a car breaks down in an evacuation area its going to cause a traffic backup
5549671 it may be typical of the pro obama dungeons amp dragons crowd to disparage a fellow countrymans memory of war from the comfort of moms basement
5549672 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs
5549673 new icaan proposal could hurt small business organizations trademarks will not be automatically reserved
5549674 this is about a publishers commitment to its author to get one of a very few pro obama books out into the marketplace in the shortest amount of time
5549675 our initial order was based on the book being available to all booksellers simultaneously an even playing field
5549676 they are not going to bully us and the book will be a huge success in spite of their boycott
5549677 every man under my command owes me 100 nazi scalps and yall will git get me 100 nazi scalps taken from the heads of 100 dead nazis or die trying
5549678 it is not just the scalping nor the carving of swastikas in foreheads or the shooting of a german officers testicles or the slow strangling scene all shown with tarantinos customary love of detail that is likely to upset the german nation and its critics
5549679 it is the whole idea of turning the second world war into a comic book adventure in which not a single german character has redeeming value
5549680 i dont want it to feel like a period film this is a modern in your face movie
5549681 he cosponsored a bill to stop horse slaughter and he also supported a bill to stop the shipment of live birds between states for the sole purpose of cockfighting he also backed a bill that aimed to put an end to people killing bears for the purpose of selling or trading their organs he also took a stand against the fur industry voting to eliminate a 2 million subsidiary they had been receiving and he also voted against allowing oil drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge saving the thousands of animals who lived there
5549682 we are disappointed but we understand celgenes decision given their recent withdrawal of the marketing authorization application for satraplatin in europe we plan to decide in the near future the next steps regarding the development of satraplatin and we will continue to focus our other efforts on advancing our rgb 286638 kinase inhibitor into the clinic and exploring various merger and acquisition opportunities
5549683 publicis groupe has been a leader in the advertising industry for decades and we believe performics growing business will benefit from being a part of it
5549684 we look forward to working with performics as a partner
5549685 doctors clearly are not convinced that the new revalidation process will provide the benefits the government is citing
5549686 less than half agree that revalidation will enhance public confidence in the medical profession or ensure physicians keep more up to date
5549687 in addition the vast majority 84 do not feel that the new procedures will be successful in identifying another harold shipman the gp who murdered more than 200 people over 23 years as one of our respondents said harold shipman would have passed all of the validation requirements there is no system which will detect this type of aberrant behavior that view was echoed by most of the gps in our survey who pointed out that shipman was well liked and competent and that no revalidation system would expose a psychopath
5549688 overall only about half of gps see any good in the revalidation process and even fewer just 28 think it is long overdue
5549689 one of our respondents summed up what seems to be the predominant feeling calling the new process a shallow political gesture with no cost benefit evidence to support it another called it another costly exercise based on an unsound premise that pulls yet more time away from our patients still others spoke about potentially resigning or moving overseas clearly physicians have grave doubts about the new procedure and its potential effects
5549690 todays announcement represents an innovative approach to the r amp d productivity challenges our pharmaceutical clients are facing
5549691 we are very excited to welcome world class lilly scientific talent to covance and to take possession of valuable state of the art assets including more than 600 000 square feet of laboratory space and acquire new service lines that will help us accelerate our long term strategic growth plans covance will invest in this facility and maximize its capacity utilization by conducting substantial work with lilly and bring in new work from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients we expect the greenfield site to be a key contributor to the future growth and success of covance
5549692 this strategic agreement is a result of a long term trust based relationship between our two companies covance has proven they can help accelerate drug development timelines and improve efficiencies with lilly which will enable us to further focus on our core competencies in delivering better patient outcomes over the longer term
5549693 this industry pioneering alliance will provide lilly access to covances broad and efficient drug development platforms in addition this collaboration will help us make our fixed cost infrastructure more flexible and continue to grow our portfolio of best in class and first in class pharmaceutical products
5549694 if we hadnt stopped exactly at that point at that time id hate to know what happened to those people
5549695 i was curious about the whale everyone was talking about it and how it would come right up to the boat
5549696 of course i was a little worried at first that he might rock the boat when he touched it or something but he never did anything like that
5549697 the first time we went out we saw him around the bell buoy and it was within minutes that he was over by our boat
5549698 the next time we went out we sat for about 15 minutes before he finally surfaced and came near
5549699 belugas are social in nature and theyre acoustic in communicative
5549700 theres nobody there of his own species to socialize with or to talk to or will talk back to him
5549701 it goes beyond curiosity its an innate need for this beluga to find social interaction and investigate anything that is acoustic in nature in his habitat hes trying to fill a void
5549702 given that belugas are very opportunistic feeders and have a wide variety of food that theyll look for its likely theres enough food around for him
5549703 because hes chosen to live in one area of water thats constantly moving because of the tidal current it means that in order for him to stay in that hes constantly working hes expending a lot of energy
5549704 theres that question that hes getting enough calories to offset the amount of energy hes expending to stay in the area if yes then he will be fine if no then over time he could definitely weaken
5549705 it is something that we can pretty much predict is going to happen at least somewhere in atlantic canada every year
5549706 its not something we can take for granted and its something we train for regularly
5549707 our members are as prepared as they could ever be for something like this
5549708 our department has considerable experience in dealing with those types of calls and have quite a bit of training we do yearly training on responding to propane fires
5549709 it was like raoul was doing everything in slow motion
5549710 it seems to have been the best medicine so far
5549711 ill tell you it was great for moving upper muscles
5549712 its just gotten to be so much easier on one level
5549713 they were having a great conversation and i fell asleep
5549714 who cares about lives i can just load from my last save
5549715 recognising the strong trade links and shared energy challenges which face our two nations the working group will draw on the expertise of both countries to continue the work begun at this forum towards achieving sustainable electricity supply
5549716 renewables can make a really decent penetration into the energy grid by 2020 we could have 40 per cent of our energy from renewables and as we start to implement energy efficiency measures we could phase out coal mine power station by 2030 we could have no more coal powered stations in australia
5549717 the global gold rush towards renewables must come to australia
5549718 the smart thing to do is for the government to have a plan that identifies sustainable industries especially in coal affected regions so those communities and workers find employment in green collar industries for renewable energy manufacturing
5549719 although the shift away from coal fired power means a natural decline in coal jobs over time they are matched by new green jobs created in energy efficiency and renewable energy
5549720 absolutely 100 percent clear and clean they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer
5549721 is it ethical for health care professionals to support the administration of drugs that are of unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed
5549722 we specifically take issue with the minister using that phrase
5549723 the minister was off base in calling into question the ethics of physicians involved in harm reduction
5549724 its clear that this was being used as a political issue
5549725 treason fled before us for resistance was in vain while we were marching through georgia

5549728 while it has been a very difficult week i believe the end result is a very positive step forward for the galaxy
5549729 bruce is the best coach for the galaxy and certainly one of the best coaches in the history of the league i am impressed with his passion desire and focus and believe that his recent experiences with the u s national team and red bulls have prepared and motivated him for this next challenge
5549730 i am very excited to assume this position with the los angeles galaxy
5549731 i realize we have a lot of work ahead of us and i am optimistic that with the support of management our coaching staff and the players we will move forward to positioning this team to qualify for this seasons mls playoffs my ultimate goal is to win championships and build a club that all of our fans will be proud of

5549752 the message remains the same melvin and high must go
5549753 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
5549754 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
5549755 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
5549756 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
5549757 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
5549758 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
5549759 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
5549760 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
5549761 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
5549762 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
5549763 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5549764 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5549765 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
5549766 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
5549767 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
5549768 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
5549769 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
5549770 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
5549771 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
5549772 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
5549773 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
5549774 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science

5549777 i hate to say that people are lying but heres a situation where folks are lying
5549778 were going to stay in iraq to get the job done as long as the government wants us there
5549779 said his government was impatiently waiting for the complete withdrawal of u
5549780 redeploy combat brigades from iraq at a pace of 1 to 2 brigades a month that would remove them in 16 months
5549781 opposes the present us policy in iraq not on the basis of any principled opposition to neo colonialism or aggressive war but rather on the grounds that the iraq war is a mistaken deployment of power that fails to advance the global strategic interests of american imperialism
5549782 theres not that much difference between my position and george bushs position at this stage
5549783 nazis soviets in their gulags or some mad regime pol pot or others that had no concern for human beings
5549784 he would return the country to the more traditional foreign policy efforts of past presidents such as george h
5549785 these days an appreciable number of obama supporters are starting to use words like disillusionment but thats a consequence of projecting their political outlooks onto the candidate in the first place the best way to avoid becoming disillusioned is to not have illusions in the first place
5549786 the international tribunal for the prosecution of persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former yugoslavia since 1991
5549787 wilful killing wilfully causing great suffering and serious injury to body and health employment of poisonous weapons and other weapons to cause unnecessary suffering wanton destruction of cities towns and villages unlawful attacks on civilian objects devastation not necessitated by military objectives attacks on undefended buildings and dwellings destruction and wilful damage done to institutions dedicated to religion charity and education the arts and sciences
5549788 not only a requirement of law it is a requirement of justice to the victims and of deterrence to powerful countries such as those in nato who in their military might and in their control over the media are lacking in any other natural restraint such as might deter less powerful countries
5549789 by holding individuals accountable regardless of their position the ictys work has dismantled the tradition of impunity for war crimes and other serious violations of international law particularly by individuals who held the most senior positions
5549790 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5549791 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5549792 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5549793 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5549794 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5549795 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5549796 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5549797 there really is no time for any frivolity people are already working two jobs to put gas in the tank so they can drive from the first job to the second job people need to spend as much of their free time as possible for candidates
5549798 i would rather you go and work for a local candidate than read my book
5549799 on the issues and on the importance of the election
5549800 but i dont agree about reading his book if people are going to vote wisely they need to understand whats at stake
5549801 i expect youll see a lot of editorial excitement from us on that book
5549802 in this world of celebrity blogs and entertainment gossip television we are intensely aware of public figures who perform the same function as mythological figures did in an earlier period
5549803 we just felt the media coverage would benefit from a clearer field postelection and that is looking increasingly true
5549804 i did not ask wealth for my own it was just to make my rival groan
5549805 his functions as commander in chief have been undertreated compared to many other aspects of his life and career
5549806 i had trouble with english class in high school thank god there was
5549807 create an identity that people would relate you to as an example when your prospective customers would think of buying 4 large framed pictures for their dining room they might think
5549808 may i suggest if there are five blokes to every girl we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa
5549809 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face
5549810 whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
5549811 two women came in and said weve got to get rid of this drongo i said id be happy to help
5549812 its horrifying that a public figure would say such things what era is he living in
5549813 hes just letting people know its good fun to be a woman in mount isa
5549814 were all rednecks up here we dont carry it around as a badge of shame we carry it around as a badge of honour
5549815 as it runs out of body reserves it may beach itself or simply slip away from us in shallow water
5549816 as that happens it does become a little bit susceptible to predators
5549817 this is going to hurt me more than it hurts you
5549818 although people have been charged there is still a lot of work to do and other lines of inquiry that need to be followed up
5549819 the investigators have made a significant stride and hopefully this dreadful case is coming to its conclusion
5549820 all i will say is that my client maintains his innocence
5549821 we were informed this morning of the news from antigua and we are pleased at how the investigation is progressing
5549822 eu observei as criaturas ao se aproximarem de mim eu desconhecia seus prop sitos eu me debatia mas n o conseguia mover meus bra os e pernas eu justamente estava l deitado como um bode para ser sacrificado no altar e quando as criaturas se aproximaram eu me amedrontei eram criaturas pequenas quase do tamanho dos pigmeus africanos eles tinham grandes cabe as e bra os e pernas muito finas eu observei senhor como um artista e pintor que esses seres eram totalmente desconjuntados na vis o de um artista seus membros eram muito longos para seus corpos e seus pesco os eram muito finos e suas cabe as quase do tamanho de melancias eles possu am esquisitos olhos arregalados eles n o tinham narizes como n s temos mas somente pequenos orif cios nos dois lados superiores entre os olhos suas bocas n o possu am l bios somente um fino risco como feito por uma navalha e enquanto eu olhava as criaturas senhor eu fiquei assustado com alguma coisa perto de minha cabe a e quando olhei para cima havia outra criatura ligeiramente maior que as outras que encontravam se perto de minha cabe a me observando eu olhava seus hipnotizantes olhos que me enfeiti avam ent o os observei pois a mesma queria que eu vidrasse seus olhos eu vi pelas suas membranas seus verdadeiros olhos por tr s da parte escura da membrana de seu arregalado olho seus olhos eram arredondados com horizontais pupilas como as de um gato e a coisa n o balan ava a cabe a mas respirava ao notar que suas narinas inalavam e exalavam mas se algu m me disser que eu cheiro que nem essas criaturas senhor sou capaz de soc lo
5549823 ca sa ai o lectura informativa trebuie sa cunosti o parte din terminologia de specialitate care nu este explicata
5549824 city buses operated in every community driving new yorkers to work school the hospital and family visits but riders never knew their drivers and the mechanics who maintained the bus fleet were unknowingly exposed to hazardous diesel fumes every day back in the depots
5549825 it is unconscionable to think that these men were subjected to these harmful fumes for such extended periods of time without any protection or warnings as to the hazard of diesel exposure
5549826 the original cluster of plaintiffs includes 11 surviving workers and family members representing two deceased plaintiffs it is likely that the number of plaintiffs will increase over time as more of the former workers or their living family members realize that there is a link between the fatal diseases that plague them and the conditions at their job sites
5549827 since literally millions of other workers in the transportation construction railroad and package delivery industries faced similar diesel fume exposure conditions resulting in heart and lung malignancies it is anticipated that additional lawsuits will follow this initial one
5549828 thanks very much for friday it was a great help and comfort particularly to have a structure to work to in answering the questions
5549829 much enjoyed yesterdays meeting which i found very useful indeed i have spoken of you to miss x who i have copied in on this email she is interested in having some assistance too
5549830 i found my mock interview with you both very informative and exceptionally useful
5549831 but why am i reading about piracy on t o g
5549832 ive been hearing so many things about party buses and last weekend was my first experience
5549833 im not allowed to go in im not allowed to go in
5549834 key drivers for the rest of our business namely capacity demand and the cost of fuel remain highly volatile
5549835 based on current market conditions and fuel prices a positive result for the current financial year is expected but remains a challenge
5549836 the operating environment during the next 12 months is expected to be the most challenging the virgin blue group which now comprises virgin blue pacific blue polynesian blue and vaustralia has experienced to date
5549837 with fuel costs at never before seen record highs for much of the year and airlines around the world struggling to cope this result is a testament to our team and business model
5549838 we have implemented a range of measures in recent months to mitigate the impact of increased fuel costs
5549839 we will continue to closely monitor the operating environment and take whatever actions are necessary to see our way through what is expected to be a challenging period
5549840 there was something in the air that night the stars were bright fernando they were shining there for you and me for liberty fernando though i never thought that we could lose theres no regret if i had to do the same again i would my friend fernando
5549841 embarcadero y is the best work out facility in the city
5549842 were not asking for any additional money from the ministry of health we believe we can self fund this its about better use of our current money
5549843 so many people want coffee that were out were brewing some more
5549844 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
5549845 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
5549846 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
5549847 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
5549848 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
5549849 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
5549850 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
5549851 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
5549852 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
5549853 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
5549854 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
5549855 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
5549856 he did the best that he could under the conditions and it was stolen
5549857 nebraska wanted me to come in and play quarterback and be part of their experience there in the four years i was at tulsa i think they went to two orange bowls a sugar bowl and maybe even a cotton bowl and johnny rodgers was a heisman trophy winner
5549858 in the four years i was at tulsa we had three losing seasons three head coaches and on probation three of the four years
5549859 i was center field and i was darn good i played short center field and dared a guy to hit it over my head no one ever did i could catch anything
5549860 id tell the left fielder and right fielder just take a break
5549861 thats when i decided to make that commitment to football put all the eggs in that one basket and try to make it as a football player and give up baseball
5549862 but i knew in doing that if i was going to play pro football it wasnt going to be at quarterback
5549863 he finally saw to it to move me but he also says even when i see him nowadays or talk to him on the phone he says youre the reason i got fired at tulsa because i granted you your wish and i would have been better off leaving you at quarterback
5549864 while im watching nebraska doing this im saying why did i choose tulsa
5549865 but i chose tulsa because it fit me it fit my personality
5549866 if you got a pass thrown to you at tulsa as a receiver you better catch it because itd be a while before it comes there again
5549867 in order to compete in the ncaa youve got to know how to compete one way to learn how to compete is to create an atmosphere around your athletic programs that other kids see and want to be part of and i think tulsas doing that now
5549868 theyve increased their facilities i cant believe it but theyre even renovating skelly stadium that tells me theyre serious about trying to continue to expand on the success that theyve been able to create
5549869 cnn contacted me about this whole thing theyre doing for the election trying to encourage people to vote and they told us they were approaching chris for the project
5549870 im a big fan of his hes got a great voice and i thought it would be a really good idea so i just gave my blessing to the project and they took it from there
5549871 i think people have come to realize what a big mistake the last time theyd voted was it might have been anyway there are two very viable candidates as far as im concerned and there is one who will be a revolutionary candidate in a way and change the direction of america and i think the more people that get out there to vote thats extremely important
5549872 its a song that requires a really strong voice to carry it off and hes got the range and the power to really do it convincingly
5549873 i dont think there are that many singers around at the moment that could really nail it out of all the singers of that style hes the strongest hes just a great singer all around it doesnt matter what style it is he could pretty much sing anything
5549874 i think its not too far away from the original
5549875 theyve modernized it a bit brought it up to todays standards with the sound and arrangement too when i heard it it made me think back to when we recorded the original it was pretty exciting at the time and i sort of got the same feeling when i heard chris version
5549876 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
5549877 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
5549878 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
5549879 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
5549880 ive never heard of anybody being helped by one of those for profit consultants
5549881 even if they do provide services its nothing that you cant get for free and to me thats the biggest fraud of all
5549882 if they keep on saying that line and they continue to fail controlling them milf sub commanders then the government will certainly control them
5549883 that statement of the milf that the activities of its commanders are not sanctioned by them its very unfortunate we cannot forever take that convenient excuse from the hierarchy of a group thats supposedly talking peace with the government
5549884 the leadership failed to prevent the action yesterday morning nonetheless when we made direct contact we were able to convince them to retreat around noon
5549885 we have been exerting our effort to pacify this milf group

5549894 intelligent design begins with a seemingly innocuous question can objects even if nothing is known about how they arose exhibit features that reliably signal the action of an intelligent cause
5549895 why are you using your ignorance to deny my providence
5549896 the maestro says its mozart but it sounds like bubble gum
5549897 when i played olli for the first time for example there was an older male fan who wrote me long letters and wanted to invite me to go on holidays with him i always politely declined but he didnt want to hear it and kept on inviting me in one letter he even asked me if i wanted to marry him and asked me where i live because he wanted to move close that was a little bit too much for me and so i stopped answering the letters
5549898 a very important question was if i could make it convincing i considered the storyline as a challenge and a big chance to learn and grow as an actor
5549899 of course its brilliant that our story now becomes known all over the world its not the case though that i cannot go outside without being attacked from some paparazzi in cologne people are used to meeting actors from tv so in this respect i can live here comparatively undisturbed
5549900 if the morningstar strain universe actually existed i would be the great spirit of it and thats the beauty of writing it allows you to create and destroy entire worlds on a whim
5549901 said that charges against him would never stand up but said he was resigning to avoid a damaging battle with the coalition over his impeachment
5549902 we need to help the with their economies but at the same time we also need to deal with vast unemployment in aboriginal communities
5549903 youve not just got to look at the industry itself about being welcoming to indigenous people but also look at the policies over the past 30 years which have deterred and impeded aboriginal people from taking up those jobs
5549904 what measures will there be to guard against people overstaying what character checks health checks
5549905 if it wasnt for this mission i dont know where i would have ended up i had no way back home no money no resources
5549906 where is it going to come from i dont know but this whole mission is a mission about faith about hope
5549907 to help them with their training skills to identify the various resources that they themselves have what sort of skills do they have what sort of background do they have how can we maneuver those resources into life skills that they can then put into place
5549908 they people may believe that we just provide housing for the derelicts or the outcasts of society that were providing them meals and these are people that many feel deserve where theyre at well no god doesnt see it that way
5549909 ive never been the kind of player who has been that close to her teammates
5549910 youre as close as you need to be to get the job done
5549911 brazil has a very talented team but we are showing our talent too
5549912 writers critics and the general public react spontaneously to an unusual set of provocative forms with concepts phrases and similes they already know
5549913 a successful iconic building will always elicit a flurry of bizarre comparisons a veritable blizzard of idiotic similes an absolute snowstorm of ridiculous conceit
5549914 the successful landmark has to be both enigmatic and expressive it must suggest much more than it names and leave the final interpretation if it ever comes
5549915 its an option that provides us with essentially emissions free energy capabilities
5549916 its a reliable and americanized form of energy and that last point is very important we need to move towards energy independence
5549917 i think sen obama clearly has the superior ideas in terms of working our way out of our energy woes and also confronting climate change
5549918 there comes a point in time in the summer when for kids they say ive gone through my summer camps ive gone through the little league season swimming vacations and theyre ready to see their friends theyre ready to be around adults that they trust and that they know and start another school year
5549919 it would typically be around this time for a couple of reasons
5549920 most of our students are already on campus for some type of extra curricular whether its the football program or volleyball so theyre here on campus to begin with so we simply extended that out and started school at the same time
5549921 so we have the opportunity if it makes sense to start in advance
5549922 for us it allows us to get our full semesters work done before the holiday break so when our students are done in december they get two full weeks off without studying for exams and come back refreshed and ready to go for the second semester
5549923 i think that does contribute to higher student performance not having that gap in there
5549924 it was a change that was made without any educational policy reason for it
5549925 it was done primarily for economic reasons to benefit the summer economy of the state
5549926 the question is is that best preparing our students for global economics best preparing the wisconsin economy for the future
5549927 we have the opportunity and were thankful for that to make the decision for what works best for us for our kids their families and for the education that were trying to provide
5549928 we think that local school boards are in the best position theyre closest to their communities to know whats best for their children and the community
5549929 i will tell people every year that one of my favorite days is this day because the faculty and staff and students breathe a vitality into this building thats undeniable

5549961 your question brings to mind a question i had the first time this came up why would a used car dealer have a fleet of limos but then i figured id have a drink and forget about it that was nice
5549962 i just wanted to let you know jimmys heard from shain tech and lawson university im so excited in fact ive masturbated to the point where my
5549963 whatever else you might say about toby she knows exactly what kind of lame ass present her lame ass husband will appreciate most im even inclined to give her the benefit of the doubt on the it wasnt easy comment despite the fact that she only visited one store and then bought it online the hard part wasnt really finding the dvd but rather the strain of pulling all the tattered shreds of her ruined desolate soul so that she could just barely care enough about ian to buy him a gift in the first place seriously thats going above and beyond the call of duty in mary worth where serving someone a plate of lurid yellow globs masquerading as shrimp scampi is considered to be a satisfactory replacement for angry make up sex
5549964 so mark trail has devolved into a man rescues girls story i cant express how surprised im not by this development
5549965 david cronenberg canadian film maker will retell the romance of liz and anthony in his next film once again he will tackle the question what is real the same marriage date used again and again and again the grooms parents unknown to the brides family despite their long interest in the wholesome young man or drunken child abandoners the mysterious dark lady the first wife or shrunken into a dark child locked in her basement cell cranes transmogrifying into crows swirling colors colours not found in nature all the characters moving jerkily about their actions controlled by a mysterious puppeteer who threatens to end this reality and start it all over again with changes cronenbergs fearlessness in presenting gut wrenching grossness will be tested in the wedding banquet scene
5549966 well you learn something every day i had no idea that
5549967 man that whole neighborhood is dysfunctional liz never stood a chance all she had left in one final act of defiance to her fate was to choose hideous colors so everyone would look as awful on the outside as they were on the inside

5549975 toby and ian are so boring that watching a pbs documentary raises the excitement level in their lives even tobys walter mitty esque inner monologues consist of nothing more than looking forward paying her credit card bill say what you want about mary worth but at least her meddling leaves a trail of death and destruction in its wake

5549983 this huge victory for cablevision and other msos will allow them to substantially reduce their capital spending essentially cable operators would no longer need to provide a dvr for each individual subscriber who desires this functionality they will not only be able to offer dvr functionality to all digital subscribers whether they currently have a dvr or not but also to every tv outlet in the house that has a digital set top box currently 26 4 of u s tv homes have a dvr and just about 30 of dvr homes have two or more of these devices while forecasts call for dvr distribution to potentially increase to 100 of digital cable homes because of this court ruling we believe these projections to be a bit overoptimistic the expansion of media technologies into the mainstream depends on ease of deployment and consumer acceptance which is driven by price while technology will be easily accessible to millions of households we do not feel that the current lukewarm demand for dvrs will suddenly move consumers to absorb the additional monthly expense dvrs have been available in the u s since the late 90s despite its widespread availability the rate of consumer adoption of dvrs has been much slower versus that of the vcr which arrived on the scene in the late 70s when the cost of vcrs was drastically reduced consumers rapidly embraced them vcr penetration exploded from 14 in 1985 to 90 in 1990 once dvr functionality became available within the digital set top box vcr penetration began to slowly decline and it currently stands at about 73 cable operators currently charge about 10 per month for dvr service however even though a centrally stored dvr service eliminates the cost of providing individual dvr hard drives to subscribers they will only need a special remote the cable operators seemingly have no intention of passing along these savings to their customers led by the soaring cost of gasoline and food the cost of living is rising at the fastest rate since the recession of the early 1990s demand for dvr functionality has become less of a priority for consumers within this challenging economy we continue to forecast that dvr penetration growth will remain slow and see no reason to believe that it will grow much beyond 40 u s by 2012 the main reason that media companies had tried to block the rollout of networked dvrs was the potential increase in commercial avoidance based on our recent analysis of post strike primetime viewing among adults 18 49 while timeshifted viewing added about 18 additional audience to the average primetime show nearly 60 of commercial minutes are skipped obviously dvrs are not solely to responsible for ad skipping lengthy commercial pods and increased clutter levels also greatly contribute therefore this makes it all the more important that we continue to further develop program engagement metrics and also accelerate the use of dvrs as an additional enhanced advertising platform
