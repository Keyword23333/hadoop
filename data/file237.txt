2370111 we have a tradition in the olympics to produce medals that is our aim here
2370112 we are never cocky we have seen through the world cup season how difficult it is even with last years gold medallists and i am sure the competition here is going to be outstanding
2370113 we dont have a matthew pinsent or a steve redgrave in the team it is a change but what we do have is a tremendous breadth of talent in all the rowing disciplines we have never for example reached an a final in the lightweights and our women have never won a gold medal i am sure they will be targets this year we won three medals in sydney and four medals in athens in all disciplines we have realistic medal chances

2370181 safety standards vary widely and their enforcement is far from vigorous in some communities
2370182 capt craig evans of the germantown police department said his department lacks the resources to patrol neighborhoods for compliance with a village ordinance that requires fencing around any pool with water deeper than 18 inches
2370183 the village is considering an ordinance that would allow police to issue tickets to students if they violate rules about the use of cell phones and other electronic devices in schools
2370184 police chief peter hoell said he thinks the ordinance would be used only a couple of times a year
2370185 the village board is expected to approve the ordinance aug 18 given that is was unanimously recommended this week by the boards public safety committee

2370250 we were unable to take the pictures we wanted because the workmen were in the way and refused to move even though they were asked to do so very politely
2370251 two members of the public entered the memorial garden site without authorisation this morning
2370252 the final construction works at the memorial garden are ongoing and as such the site remains a construction site which is not open to the public this unauthorised entry is therefore a breach of site security and contravenes health amp safety regulations
2370253 staff at the construction site requested the persons to leave the site and an investigation into the incident is being carried out the matter may then be reported to the health amp safety executive
2370254 everyone has been alarmed at recent revelations about the loss of personal data by various arms of government across the uk like the loss of half the countrys bank details by her majestys revenue and customs
2370255 it is deeply troubling that in northern ireland the number of lost medical records has risen year on year since 2005 06
2370256 for a whole host of reasons no one would want potentially all and sundry to know everything about their health and well being
2370257 for a person to gain access to their own medical records it isnt even a simple and straightforward exercise with them quite rightly having to enter into a process involving various checks
2370258 indeed in certain circumstances doctors have the right to withhold from the patient any information the release of which would cause serious harm to the mental or physical health of the patient or where there are concerns about capacity
2370259 i welcome the fact that nhs in northern ireland have an incident recording system in place which allows them to act appropriately as quickly as possible to either a breach of or loss of a medical record
2370260 the department has also drawn up a records management controls assurance standard which is subject to audit within each organisation compliance is monitored annually by the department
2370261 where in the world would you most like to go
2370262 i would like to do or have this but i cant because
2370263 people are always blaming circumstance for what they are i do not believe in circumstance the people who get on in this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstance they want and if they cant find them they make them
2370264 and just when i thought i was tired of that dull grey sky the warm sun came out of the clouds like a burst of fire
2370265 it is clear even to a casual observer that mr carter deliberately invited prosecution it is quite clear that mr carter by his actions was aware that this was an enclosed area he is therefore guilty as charged i sentence him to hang by the neck until he is dead

2370292 itll eventually dawn on the football fraternity that theres probably two levels i dont think theyre being realistic
2370293 theres been such negative talk from all the counties about the murphy cup that it probably needs to rest for a while and come back perhaps in another shape
2370294 occasionally somebody will come through a round or two of the all ireland qualifiers but ultimately the teams that are playing in the tommy murphy cup have a lot of work to do
2370295 i saw a very interesting piece of information today that i had forgotten about where not so long ago wexford played in the tommy murphy cup final and we see the sort of progress they have made
2370296 im not suggesting that that they used the tommy murphy cup but maybe at the end of the day they had an attitude that well try and work our way out of the situation and work our way up
2370297 while the tommy murphy cup has been the level we have been at obviously you always want to move up in the world we are very keen to achieve this as soon as we can

2370305 i think its somewhat tied to growth in food processing i think its somewhat tied to growth in the agricultural industries but i think its also a result of adding jobs to our employment base
2370306 vedrai ke se siete davvero destinati prima o poi vi rincontrerete
2370307 im really anxious to see what happens when the big light goes on this light that happened at last weeks scrimmage that was a little light this is a big light that goes on this week
2370308 so im really anxious to see what happens there ive been in some of those situations where guys that practice really well fade away i talked to my team about that i dont want those guys i dont want the guys that fade away i want the guys that practice well to play well ive been on the other side of the coin where some guys come out here and really you dont notice them a whole lot and the next thing you know in a game all of a sudden they step up and thats what you want to see its going to be kind of nice to see some other people on the other side of the ball and to see how they respond im excited about that
2370309 i think its huge coach sparano talks to us and its a game its not just practice a team wins and a team loses
2370310 were going to go out there and try to win at everything we do and win the game its going to be fun getting back into that atmosphere hitting someone else and finally playing a game its going to be very exciting
2370311 even without the dollar i was saying commodities were broken this breaks them more
2370312 its still a demand driven story and this is not traded purely off of dollar weakness
2370313 this is going to bury people on anything commodity related
2370314 the momentum trade out is more powerful than any of the fundamentals
2370315 you have to trade the market you have not the one you wish for
2370316 id be a lot more uncertain about the fundamentals underlying the financials then the fundamentals underlying commodities
2370317 how you can buy back all these munis and not have them cost you any money which is the logic people seem to be using to buy financials
2370318 before giving land concessions to companies the government should talk with the people in advance whether the land concession will affect peoples livelihoods or not
2370319 i would remind them that when the water was over the portholes and john paul joness ship was sinking the british commanders yelled across the bow do you surrender and john paul jones retorted i have not yet begun to fight then i would take them to a town hall meeting where freedom echoed out through the chambers give me liberty or give me death now youre getting like one fighter jumping on the other fighter and calling him out youre calling out the heritage of this nation
2370320 what you are selling is america youve got excitement beyond belief
2370321 theyve researched where the votes are and theyve thrown away the old democratic playbooks
2370322 instead of just relying on a large number of urban votes theyre going to suburban areas and reaching out to a large number of conservatives
2370323 its moving to a bigger not just pro life but includes people who care deeply about homelessness the environment darfur
2370324 the question who is an evangelical involves a much broader picture and the guy who has been talking about faith is obama
2370325 i think the senators political team or whoevers making the decision was smart to associate him with warren it suggests that there are evangelical moderates that they can work with or reach or maybe even attract their votes
2370326 there is one camp in evangelicalism who truly want to follow jesus and another much narrower the christian political power brokers who want to follow conservative politics
2370327 to be chosen to carry the flag its just an amazing feeling and it is such an honour
2370328 i have three days to come back down and refocus on my own event which ive worked four years for
2370329 the years of training sacrifice and competition all relentlessly focused on this moment have earned you this ticket to compete in the most prestigious sporting competition in the world
2370330 it takes years of hard work and dedication just to participate in the games i want to congratulate every member of team ireland on their personal achievement in qualifying
2370331 police are currently examining the issue and it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time
2370332 yes i received a bill from the psni towards the policing costs but i told them by letter i would not be paying
2370333 there is no law or regulation that states that i have to pay these costs i have never paid towards policing costs before as ive never been asked before
2370334 inside the event is entirely different and it is up to the promoter to pay for those costs and i hired a security company
2370335 if the police want to start charging concert promoters does that mean they will charge other events rugby football gaa or even parades
2370336 we will not go to the meeting if there is no solution to complaints from people who could not vote
2370337 what we want is for the national election committee to respect the will of the people who could not vote about 1 million of them
2370338 the government will be set up on aug 26 after the national assembly opens its first full session on aug 24
2370339 the new cabinet will be bigger than the last cabinet
2370340 i have an addiction to color and uncontrolled urge to see colors play with each other in ever changing combinations

2370342 football season is around the corner so why not kick it off with a true 1080p big screen
2370343 two ana sergeants began to rally some of their fellow soldiers and direct their frustration towards the royal irish soldiers in the base
2370344 as the evening wore on a crowd of local nationals gathered outside the patrol base again fuelled by this small discontented ana group
2370345 warnings were given by the locals for the ana to move out of the base so they could deal with the uk troops left there
2370346 a senior ana officer was flown out to the patrol base and having assessed the situation placed the two ana sergeants under arrest
2370347 once the ringleaders had been dealt with a meeting was arranged with the local elders to discuss the incident
2370348 this meeting concluded that the death of the child and the injuries to her mother were purely accidental and the royal irish soldiers in the patrol base had done all they could to assist those injured

2370372 when our analyst offered to fax the form the washington county operator didnt say this is really time critical had he done that our analyst would have done a callback verification
2370373 they are just trying to pass that off on somebody else
2370374 instead of hitting the 800 number and sending this call that nobody is on the other end of and that theres no location information for to vermont 911 they sought to find who it was so they called verizon wireless

2370385 is this another skeleton in the democratic closet that barack obama must struggle to overcome
2370386 people are now coming around to the fact that growth is slowing both in the u s and overseas so demand for commodities will decline
2370387 everybody is scrambling to get out of the ship before the guy next to them
2370388 it s amazing how fast commodities have become the last place people want to have their money
2370389 it looks like the bulls have run out of ammo
2370390 with poor demand prospects ahead there s not a lot of reason to be buying commodities right now
2370391 i don t see them with their scorched fingers coming back into the market that money is gone for a while
2370392 but we re not expecting that to happen for at least a few quarters
2370393 but the question is how intense is it and how long will it last
2370394 does anyone out there think barack obama is too thin to be president anyone having a hard time relating to him and his no excess body fat please let me know thanks
2370395 yes i think he sic is to sic skinny to be president i wont vote for any beanpole guy
2370396 the article should have disclosed that the reporter used the bulletin board to elicit the comment

2370405 is this another skeleton in the democratic closet that barack obama must struggle to overcome

2370409 i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2370410 house leadership aides pushed back against interpretations of this comment as self aggrandizing
2370411 o ne leadership aide said the full quote put it into a different context
2370412 indeed as noted the leadership aides version of the quote is entirely consistent with numerous other statements obama has made over the last two years
2370413 m y colleague jonathan weisman and i believe the quote was correct as written and that this supposed context is a recreation after the fact by democratic aides who were worried about how the quote looked
2370414 media watchdog groups say the first term senator has garnered far more positive reporting than his opponent especially during his jaunt abroad
2370415 since the primaries ended on air evaluations of barack obama have been 72 negative vs 28 positive thats worse than john mccains coverage which has been 57 negative vs 43 positive during the same time period
2370416 i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2370417 is this another skeleton in the democratic closet that barack obama must struggle to overcome

2370428 we have requested law enforcement agencies to be alert for any buses being operated by angel tours or iguala busmex since they are not authorized to operate legally
2370429 if found on the road we want law enforcement to immediately stop and place the vehicles out of service
2370430 law enforcement operations like this should reassure the public that ice is committed to putting public safety first

2370434 we expected the natural decay rate was 25 a year but very little of the oil actually disappeared
2370435 whats left is going to be there a long time
2370436 the theory has been that on a rocky shore its not going to stay for that long that waves will wash it away

2370451 but i also know how much i love america i know that for more than two centuries we have strived at great cost and great sacrifice to form a more perfect union to seek with other nations a more hopeful world

2370458 when people hear the word zombies and are told to demonstrate what it reminds them of they generally stick out there arms like so
2370459 and then they start saying braaaaaains we researched it four out of five zombie experts agree
2370460 i dont know doesnt it just seem kind of like an overplayed idea something that were consistently bombarded with already what about originality
2370461 dude i didnt get rich off by being original i give the people what they want zombies that crave brains when the public demands zombies thats what theyre talking about otherwise we wouldnt really be looking at zombies here would we
2370462 youd think after all of this theyd at least be good
2370463 it really is much harder to get them to synchronize when all their ah attributes arent the same
2370464 its a work in progress well improve it next time around
2370465 theres always a glimmer of hope at the end of zombie movies
2370466 but still were going for the same general theme they all have a similar undertone despair distress seemingly no way out the end of the world a glimmer of hope etc etc we have a staff that monitors these kinds of things
2370467 this was a tv show its not anymore you dont have any staff anymore
2370468 this is so much more now you dont control it anymore you cant predict it its out of your hands what about my children what about my husband theyre out there somewhere arent they theyre going to die without me oh billy jamie oh god god oh god oh god
2370469 she says i cant predict anything anymore well i knew that was coming in the zombie stories the housewives always start crying about their children and end up doing something irrational that turns out to be almost the end of everyone else in the story ha i cant predict anything
2370470 if im right which im pretty sure i am because ive studied this kind of thing everyone is about to declare what they intend to do thisll cause a clash of ideas and will probably end in our near destruction but dont worry ive studied this kind of thing i know how well need to get out of it just stay with me i can tell what people are like and what theyll do by just looking at them ive studied this kind of thing you know
2370471 i cant let this continue ive got friends and family out there ive got a gun what can these bastards do to me im getting out of here
2370472 ah the na ve heroism of the law enforcer who wants to fight against all odds for what he thinks is right i knew it didnt i tell you i knew it
2370473 my billy my jamie my husband oh god my house my dog my everything i cant stay here i cant i cant stay in here while i know theyre out there oh billy oh jamie
2370474 the housewife that is concerned about her family and material possessions who will run out in desperation because she cant figure things out rationally probably because shes a housewife im good i know it you dont need to tell me
2370475 i dont want to die im just a bus driver man a bus driver i shouldnt be eaten by zombies i cant fucking stay here and wait for my death ive got to get the fuck out of here ive got to get the fuck out of here
2370476 yes yes the plea of the ah lower class individual hes poor so he doesnt think he can die any special way but i guess dying by zombies is the norm now
2370477 fuck this shit i didnt ask for no motherfuckers to make no fucking zombies to fuckin eat me nobody asked me if i wanted to live in a zombie infested world this shit is so fucking unfair fuck you zombies
2370478 the rebellious girl who wont take no shit but is still self conscious about how everyone else sees her thinks its unfair shes pretty though isnt she
2370479 that was a rapping zombie a zombie that raps that must mean it was a black zombie or african american person of color afro american i dont know i cant really keep up with what were supposed to call them ive never seen a rapping zombie in person this is exciting
2370480 how do you know the zombies skin color if you havent even seen it
2370481 the zombies usually sing the type of music id think theyd sing
2370482 we obviously couldnt figure out how the public would identify each individual based on their personalities so we just found ways to group people in other ways such as skin color the clothes they wear what social class theyre from you know overall groupings like that we found its much simpler just to take a group of people or rather zombies and base the genre of songs theyll sing on how theyre already viewed the best zombies are the kind of zombies that we all already know and hold dear it makes for the best and safest television movies albums dont you watch television
2370483 i think weve got a larger problem to deal with here
2370484 this is more exciting in real life than it is on tv
2370485 i never really liked the country singing zombies ive always felt like they needed some more work anyway who wants to bet that zombie is wearing a cowboy hat anyone eddie nah nevermind i dont think you could afford to bet with me
2370486 the first one said he was in an alley but theres no alleys inside of this mall he must have meant it metaphorically theyre singing songs right not everything in songs is straightforward alleys are usually perceived as dark and dangerous places my guess is theyre in some tight dark walking space waiting for one of us to come by
2370487 your guess we dont need a fucking guess what good is a guess going to do us
2370488 we should all split up and try to find the fucking zombies who are in the mall
2370489 you have a fucking gun sure lets split up and then one by one we can be picked off and then you can gun down our singing zombie asses too
2370490 i dont need you all tailing me around youre a bunch of luggage thatll get me killed
2370491 you all stay here ill go find and kill the goddamn singing fucks that somehow got in here
2370492 i think you may have been right about that whole alley dark thing oh this is exciting
2370493 how did those fuckers get in the god damn mall in the first place
2370494 did you let them in did you let the fucking zombies in
2370495 i tired to leave last night through the garage exit door to find my billy and my jamie but oh god i heard one of them singing and i ran i closed the door but i think i forgot to lock it im sorry im so sorry
2370496 see didnt i tell you shed be the end of us all
2370497 do you want to kill us is that it you want us all to die well in that case youre no better than those singing fuckers to me i might as well kill you since youve gone and killed all of us
2370498 ah i think our friend jerry is no longer our friend
2370499 80s hair metal well i guess this isnt really a topic too far fetched for an iron maiden song
2370500 fuck this fuck this fuck you and fuck you and fuck you and fuck you you singing zombie fucks
2370501 im not sure this would make it onto television theres way too much swearing this would probably have to be made into a movie in fact its got a pretty good soundtrack already
2370502 its really not worth putting up a fight for we might as well walk over there and let them get it done with i mustve been wrong about this one there really doesnt seem like a glimmer of hope anywhere i dont think were going to make it through this
2370503 you really wouldnt make that good of a character youre way too quiet
2370504 my guess is standard radio rock ever heard of creed possibly something like that i may be a ceo but im a pretty cool guy if you havent noticed
2370505 i will not let you change me i will not let you tell me what to sing you cannot control me i am my own person you have no right to change me and to generalize me i am autonomous i am alive i am myself no matter what you do or say you cannot have my brain
2370506 steamy hot pile of crap wedged between two pieces of bread

2370511 is a recreation after the fact by democratic aides who were worried about how the quote looked
2370512 i cant say whether the first rendition of the quote was more accurate than the second
2370513 inside according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
2370514 house leadership aides pushed back against interpretations of this comment as self aggrandizing
2370515 o ne leadership aide said the full quote put it into a different context
2370516 house democratic aides got up thursday morning and decided that the quotes looked bad
2370517 hopefully we neednt go through all of this again but to make sure everybodys clear my colleague jonathan weisman and i believe the quote was correct as written and that this supposed context is a recreation after the fact by democratic aides who were worried about how the quote looked perhaps obama didnt mean for it to come out that way but theres every reason to believe it did

2370526 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2370527 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2370528 if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2370529 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2370530 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices
2370531 with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly
2370532 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2370533 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false

2370541 the task of building out something to handle e commerce internally is a pretty daunting task when most companies are just trying to keep their heads above water
2370542 weve been through a couple recessions and it seems that clients are more skittish about making investments in their internal infrastructure

2370551 when our mother passed away we were looking for a way to honor her memory in a unique manner she has sewn all her life all sorts of projects

2370573 what i think bishop mcmahons heartwarming speech did most of all was to convey to those gathered that he was not simply there as a token prelate but that he really enjoyed taking part actively that he supported our work and that he was prepared to crack some jokes that he knew we would enjoy being entirely on our wavelength and as they say reading from the same page
2370574 bishop mcmahon has certainly won the hearts of the priests who came to merton all of a sudden there is someone that many priests loyal to pope benedict will be watching closely and including in their mementos at the mass
2370575 there remains still another condition that arose during the process of going to bed on a crowded canal boat when the floor and tables were all occupied as well as the shelves it became necessary to erect a zigzag series of clotheslines back and forth across the cabin on which the discarded garments of the passengers might be hung the scenic effect produced in the sleeping room when this process had been completed somewhat resembled that displayed by the back yard of a modern tenement house on washday finally after all the travelers were spread out upon their berths and on the tables and floor and the light had been put out the unhappy assemblage subsided into a restless but unseen throng in which the stillness was only broken by faint moaning the creaking of the boat and an occasional stentorian snore after suffering for several hours amid the conditions here outlined it was a common occurrence that some passenger abandoned his endeavor to obtain rest in an upper berth and decided to quit it for the better air and greater comfort to be found on the roof he therefore cautiously lowered his feet in the direction of some table whose position as it stood when he went to bed was remembered by him he would try to perform this operation of getting a foothold with utmost quietude in order that he might not disturb his fellow travelers hanging from his shelf by his elbows and feeling in the darkness with his foot for the table he was seeking he might at last find it only to step on the prostrate form of some belated passenger to whom it had been allotted then the mischance occurred and being anxious to comply with the sudden protest which it evoked he would hastily try to shift the position of his feet only to discover that he was astraddle of one of the clotheslines he then abandoned further hope of a peaceful solution of his difficulties and let go without caring where he alighted or how

2370577 people are now coming around to the fact that growth is slowing both in the u s and overseas so demand for commodities will decline
2370578 everybody is scrambling to get out of the ship before the guy next to them
2370579 its amazing how fast commodities have become the last place people want to have their money
2370580 it looks like the bulls have run out of ammo
2370581 with poor demand prospects ahead theres not a lot of reason to be buying commodities right now

2370630 en esta conferencia cont a p ginai12 en di logo telef nico desde m xico hemos aceptado que por lo menos para la pr xima d cada no hay perspectivas de lograr una vacuna efectiva al mismo tiempo los ltimos datos muestran por primera vez cierta estabilidad en las cifras globales del vih con 33 millones de casos es un n mero inmenso pero la cantidad de nuevas infecciones ya no crece al ritmo de las ltimas dos d cadas
2370631 las acciones que desarrollamos empiezan a dar fruto hay un aumento significativo en la cantidad de personas que reciben tratamiento antirretroviral y un crecimiento importante en la cantidad de mujeres infectadas que durante el embarazo acceden a tratamientos que adem s de proteger su salud previenen la trasmisi n al beb ya el 33 por ciento de las embarazadas en el mundo tiene acceso a estos programas
2370632 ese mismo dato significa tambi n que siete de cada diez embarazadas no reciben tratamiento y en adultos la cantidad de pacientes que se infecta cada d a es mayor que la cantidad que inicia tratamiento
2370633 un trabajo presentado en el marco de esta conferencia demuestra que otorgan como m nimo m s de una d cada de vida saludable y se estima que los pacientes podr n llegar a m s de 40 a os de vida saludable anunci gonz lez montaner hay incluso medicamentos efectivos para pacientes que ya han desarrollado resistencia a distintas drogas
2370634 en esta conferencia verificamos un cambio revolucionario en los lineamientos terap uticos hasta hace un tiempo entend amos la evoluci n de la enfermedad del siguiente modo luego de la infecci n un ciclo asintom tico de aproximadamente una d cada seguido por la aparici n de la inmunodeficiencia el sida entonces el tratamiento era para disminuir o evitar la inmunodeficiencia y comprend a a todo aquel en quien la cantidad de linfocitos cd4 estuviese por debajo de los 350 por mililitro de sangre pero ahora entendemos que ese per odo asintom tico es en realidad un estado de inflamaci n cr nica durante el cual el virus da a los ri ones el coraz n el h gado aunque los linfocitos est n por encima de ese l mite hay que iniciar tratamiento ante cualquier indicio de riesgo cardiovascular o enfermedad que pueda ser empeorada por el virus
2370635 desde luego advirti gonz lez montaner los tratamientos no han dejado de tener efectos secundarios la mejor opci n siempre es no infectarse y el uso de preservativos es esencial pero admitiendo que este uso no es todav a generalizado y consistente hay que observar que en las personas bajo tratamiento la cantidad de virus se minimiza lo cual hace menos probable que trasmitan la infecci n as el acceso generalizado a los tratamientos tiene tambi n un importante efecto preventivo
2370636 combinar estrategias efectivas la reducci n de da os por ejemplo para los usuarios de drogas inyectables la educaci n la promoci n del preservativo reformas legislativas que disminuyan la discriminaci n
2370637 en el plano de la investigaci n hemos avanzado much simo en los ltimos 25 a os
2370638 al reconocer que de todo lo que sabemos poco es lo que se ha implementado porque en el liderazgo pol tico mundial falta reconocer que el vih es un problema fundamental aun en pa ses desarrollados los programas son relativamente d biles de poca intensidad estamos en condiciones de demostrar que los nuevos casos podr an bajar hasta un 50 por ciento en menos de cinco a os implementando recursos como stos aumentar la oferta de tests de vih buscar activamente los casos conducir a la gente a los tratamientos en vez de esperar a que vengan generalizar la cobertura de tratamientos intensificar las pol ticas de prevenci n y adecuarlas a cada poblaci n disminuir la discriminaci n si es necesario cambiando legislaciones facilitar siempre el acceso a los tratamientos

2370653 the threat of more storms was real and we decided to cancel for the safety of the horses the jockeys and the fans
2370654 the washout was pretty deep its not just one spot its in three different places
2370655 every time it rains hard like that we have the same problems around the five sixteenths pole

2370661 when you start verbally abusing the staff which some people do youre taking a big chance
2370662 so of course i go back into the kitchen and repeat that
2370663 sweating bullets and the chef came out stood in the doorway and glared at him
2370664 you paid for it especially in this economy people arent going out to eat as much the pressure is higher you have to deliver a better experience for the money there are restaurants that are doing better in this economy because theyre so on top of their game that their regulars always come back restaurants that blow through 20 waiters a week where you never see the same waiter twice those are the ones who are going down
2370665 if you reserve it ahead of time unless the president or the governor comes in it shouldnt be a big problem

2370677 i never really thought about being a writer but when i had the dream the characters were ones i didnt want to forget
2370678 an unusual experience because i felt obsessive about the process it wasnt like me to be so hard to be with all the kids around
2370679 its been a real whirlwind more like a lightning strike
2370680 sometimes i feel guilty people go through so much to get published and i skipped over the bad parts it feels like cheating somehow
2370681 i just kept going after the first one and wrote four books in one year
2370682 its equal in pain and can drag on and on
2370683 if it werent for j k rowling i think publishers wouldnt be willing to put out lengthy books
2370684 it just proves that if a book is good enough young people will read it people say teens have short attention spans but they are quite capable of reading longer books there are tons of kids aged 16 or 17 who dig shakespeare and austen
2370685 vampires while dark and icky are attractive sophisticated and intelligent theyre forever youthful powerful things people crave or envy no one looks at a zombie and wants to be like that

2370695 it wasnt a struggle at all unfortunately things didnt really happen for me on the back nine
2370696 i played the back nine better than i did the front and its a hard course its very difficult and this is a major its not supposed to be easy were pushed to the limit and things can happen at any time
2370697 i thought i had made putts on 11 and 12 to get it back to even finally made one on 13 and then i just turned around and gave it right back
2370698 but you know im within four going into the weekend and theres a lot of golf left it wont be difficult if you play well to make up some ground

2370701 my first question is can a person truly understand physics and apply equations to problems without using calculus or is algebra and trigonometry suffice to learn it i hear the reason why calculus is needed is to know how the formula is derived with the other option being memorizing it and accepting it as true

2370704 if you define it as the intentional targeting of civilian populations for the purpose of intimidating the enemy then terrorism is always unlawful
2370705 it seems to me that the moment has come when the question of bombing of german cities simply for the sake of increasing the terror should be reviewed otherwise we shall come into control of an utterly ruined land we shall not for instance be able to get housing material out of germany for our own needs because some temporary provision would have to be made for the germans themselves i feel the need for more precise concentration upon military objectives such as oil and communications behind the immediate battle zone rather than on mere acts of terror and wanton destruction
2370706 why then should any of todays combatants be they territorially based or not confine their mode of combat to anything less than that to which the great powers resort whenever they find it a matter of hobbesian expediency

2370725 the overarching economic narrative of the 2008 campaign is the idea that life for the middle class has grown more difficult
2370726 the most downbeat short term assessment of personal progress in nearly half a century
2370727 when my college educated gainfully employed thirty something friends and i get together we talk about money
2370728 we talk about our inadequate health insurance and whether we can afford it about how to juggle credit card payments and crushing student loans this wasnt the life id expected
2370729 the lives of individual americans have grown simultaneously more prosperous and more precarious
2370730 there is no more consensus now than there was 70 years ago

2370743 people self select for careers on wall street they self select for the money
2370744 wall street is a sales business they sell bonds securities transactions ideas theyre not paid to be long term philosophical reflective
2370745 these are my mba students not just mine but mbas from harvard stanford pennsylvania
2370746 they were buying and selling this garbage subprime mortgage securities are they so stupid they got compensated for doing it if they didnt do it theyd lose their jobs

2370750 spending for retirees mainly social security medicaid is already nearly half the federal budget unless we curb these rising costs we will crush our children with higher taxes reflecting longer life expectancies we should gradually raise the eligibility ages for these programs and trim benefits for wealthier retirees both democrats and republicans are to blame for inaction waiting longer will only worsen the problem

2370763 we had people all up and down the pipeline that were saying this is going to threaten our water supplies and we don t want this
2370764 to extract this low quality oil from tar sands oil companies are burning through reserves of natural gas our children will need one day
2370765 dredging up dirtier and dirtier oil to fuel inefficient vehicles is like washing the dishes with scotch and the damage to our rural way of life keeps mounting
2370766 i m sure transcanada and conocophillips have the technical angle duly covered
2370767 it s not in their interest to have leaks on the pipeline because it impacts shipper economics and shipper confidence and therefore their returns

2370783 as ive said many times i believe brian westbrook is the best running back in football

2370800 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public when a supermarket tabloid told a version of the story i used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it but being 99 honest is no longer enough
2370801 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices and i had hoped that it would never become public with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly but that misconduct took place for a short period in 2006 it ended then i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established i only know that the apparent father has said publicly that he is the father of the baby i also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help

2370826 it was an important issue to keep him here there are very few players who have left me against my will and it is unusual for anybody to want to leave united
2370827 i think thats finished now when we had the meeting in portugal last month the lad quickly agreed with me hell be a great player next season because hes still improving hell be absolutely fantastic for us
2370828 the important thing is that we have ended all the stuff about real madrid and as he gets older he will appreciate being here more that happens with players the longer they stay here and they dont want to leave if you look at rio ferdinand he joined us as a young man from leeds but he has now become a real manchester united person who loves the club they come north to a colder wetter climate but they come to a real football city which not many cities can say

2370880 ada banyak bukti untuk menyanggah laporan tersebut termasuk berbagai laporan dari forrester dan analisa lainnya yang terkesan cenderung mencari sensasi daripada menyajikan perspektif industri bermutu berdasarkan diskusi dengan kalangan profesional it atau pengetahuan yang mendalam sungguh mengecewakan organisasi seperti forrester memberikan pendekatan semacam ini
2370881 while rbs does face the threat of further write downs and or a u k recession our view is that the company has taken a conservative stance on write downs and has the benefit of diversification away from the u k
2370882 the public have every right to be concerned about the growth of this sort of violence
2370883 it is a tragedy that this sort of triviality caused such a young man to lose his life and it has caused enduring heartache to his friends and family
2370884 the pain that martins death has caused for our family is indescribable
2370885 we as a family will never make sense of the unnecessary suffering that was inflicted upon martin
2370886 life will never be the same a piece of our heart has been taken
2370887 this was a vengeful attack out of all proportion to what may have gone before and no mercy was shown
2370888 this is such a case which leads from dirty looks to death in one hour
2370889 we are just hoping that the people who have been involved with martins murder will learn from what has happened to martin
2370890 genocide is regrettable but dont lose perspective it is simply one of many tragedies in the world today and a fairly modest one in terms of lives lost
2370891 civil conflict in congo has claimed more than 5 4 million lives over the last decade according to careful mortality surveys by the international rescue committee thats at least 10 times the toll in darfur but because congo doesnt count as genocide just as murderous chaos no one has paid much attention to it does a mother whose child dies from banditry malaria or aids grieve any less than a mother whose child was killed by the janjaweed
2370892 so instead of pushing bush to worry about darfur where its not clear he can make a difference get him to focus on bed nets or deworming or iodizing salt in poor countries or stopping mother to child transmission of the virus that causes aids or so many other areas where his attention could have a humanitarian impact
2370893 genocide has always evoked a transcendent horror and it has little to do with the numbers of victims the holocaust resonates not because 6 million jews were killed but because a government picked people on the basis of their religious heritage and tried to exterminate them
2370894 there are also practical arguments for genocide can create cycles of revenge and displacement that make it far more destabilizing than any famine or epidemic the darfur genocide may well lead all sudan to fragment into civil war interrupting sudanese oil exports and raising oil prices
2370895 has been even more myopic particularly since the victims in darfur are all muslims
2370896 do dead muslims count only when israel is the culprit cant the islamic world muster one hundredth as much indignation for the genocidal slaughter of hundreds of thousands of muslims as it can for a few danish cartoons
2370897 i then asked the commander about where the weapons came from that he and the janjaweed militias used
2370898 yes china is the strongest ally of sudan they benefit greatly from our oil revenues thats why china keeps a strong relationship there why they support sudan militarily why they support sudan by army training by weapons and so on
2370899 i am a person of indian origin i think its unfair that the record only gives indian restaurants 2 5 stars at the best while crappy so called french restaurants get better ratings is our food not good enough for you
2370900 it wouldnt surprise me if he had tried to help others thats what he was like
2370901 i always worried about him when he went climbing but i never stopped him doing his dream he was always happy go lucky very laid back and had a very kind nature but no matter what he would never have stopped his climbing
2370902 when he was abseiling down one of the guys made a big technical mistake and he fell when you abseil you must take two ropes and he only took one rope
2370903 the helicopter came but it was too late he fell a lot of metres he had no chance
2370904 they saw their friend falling from the top to the bottom they could do nothing because when he was falling it was too late
2370905 i was a pretty fat kid didnt do much other than eat and play computer games
2370906 climbing took over when i was 16 after a trip to the dolomites these last years ive lost my belly and took climbing seriously finding it a vent from life and somewhere to push myself competitively ive learnt a lot about myself some of it good some of it bad climbing is my demon but its also my cure

2370910 i have an addiction to color and uncontrolled urge to see colors play with each other in ever changing combinations
2370911 thread colors have been transformed into painted transitions the textures of my fabric have become playful paint strokes
2370912 maybe at the end of lambeth i have discovered i am angrier than i thought i was
2370913 i am losing my patience i have tried to play by the rules and be respectful and sometimes it would be nice to be shown a little respect back i try to keep my sympathy for williams and i do worry and pray for him i dont believe this refusal to recognise homosexual relationships can have a place within the church is whats in his heart unless hes changed very much since he became archbishop of canterbury
2370914 he might be surprised to see me there but i wont be surprised to see him
2370915 its just been so warm welcoming and wonderful to be in scotland
2370916 i was invited to celebrate the communion here which i wasnt in england i had a wonderful time in glasgow
2370917 i dont believe the split has to happen ever since my consecration the conservatives have pointed to the next gathering they said this is the time when everyones going to have to choose then we get to that point and it doesnt happen so iil believe it when i see it
2370918 i have about four or five cousins who are gay all going back to one side of the family
2370919 just two months ago another cousin came out hes married with a teenage son and its really astounding
2370920 i loved it i really enjoyed having a sister there was too much attention on me i wanted someone else take a little of the heat
2370921 i have to like attention or i wouldnt be doing this
2370922 hes a very private person so this is his worst nightmare being in the limelight the fact that hes done it not just ungrudgingly but as my greatest supporter is an enormous gift to me and to the church but i think he worries about my personal safety more than i do
2370923 mark works for the state of new hampshire getting hospitals and medical personnel ready either for a terrorism event an outbreak of avian flu or some kind of epidemic hes used to dealing with potential disaster
2370924 i am not at all sure its true as best as i can discern its true its gods will and i think only over time do we really come to know the answer
2370925 as more and more christians make themselves known to us as gay or lesbian the more we realise they are not outside the embrace of god i think that will prove itself over time but i caution people all the time to be very careful of anyone who says they know what gods will is i dont think any of us know that
2370926 it seems hes been especially welcoming to the conservative voices within the anglican union yet those of us on the other side of that issue can hardly get in at all its very discouraging
2370927 when i first started my ministry divorced people were not welcome at communion and if they got remarried they could not receive the churchs blessing now neither of these things is the case
2370928 jesus out of his own mouth says remarriage is adultery and yet the church has determined in its own wisdom and by the lead of the spirit that gods leading us to a new place
2370929 it raises what i think is the real issue here did god stop revealing himself at the end of the first century when the scripture was closed or did god as jesus said he would send his holy spirit to lead us into truth
2370930 i hope it doesnt come to that but if i had to choose i would have to stand on the side of the fully inclusive love of god over unity however you might define that
2370931 even lovers need a holiday far away from each other
2370932 tutti hanno bisogno di stare un p lontani luno dallaltro

2370934 i am sorry to let you know objective have informed us that a computer memory stick has gone missing

2370938 this data was not lost by the bbc itself but stolen from an independent production company working for cbbc however we took the issue very seriously
2370939 theres absolutely no evidence this data has been misused and the measures we took were entirely precautionary
2370940 whilst the independent company was responsible for this issue we took it seriously cbbc suspended new commissions and work on new programming until a full review of objectives practices took place
2370941 behind these figures are thousands of families facing sleepless nights worrying about how to make their next mortgage payment many thousands more will be waking up to the frightening reality of repossession the government urgently needs to step in
2370942 i have said on a number of occasions that we are looking at all the options and stamp duty is one of them but ive also always said that stamp duty and removing it in itself may not kick start the market in the way that people think it might stamp duty represents a small amount of the upfront costs so we have to look at all these issues
2370943 bumped into making a decision before the pre budget report
2370944 what we have done is put 10m behind more debt advice for people 90 per cent of our county courts now have free legal advice and we know that if people get the right advice something like 85 per cent of repossessions can be avoided but we are also looking at more ways in which we can help people facing difficulties

2370957 v lkermord ist bedauerlich aber man sollte nicht das wesentliche aus den augen verlieren er ist doch blo eine von vielen trag dien in der heutigen welt und im hinblick auf die todesopfer eine eher mittelm ige
2370958 der b rgerkrieg im kongo hat gem einer sorgf ltigen studie des international rescue committee im vergangenen jahrzehnt mehr als 5 4 millionen leben gefordert das ist mindestens das zehnfache der zahlen in darfur da jedoch der kongo nicht als v lkermord gilt lediglich als m rderisches chaos hat ihm niemand besonders viel aufmerksamkeit gezollt trauert eine mutter deren kind durch banditentum malaria oder aids stirbt etwa weniger als eine mutter deren kind durch die janjaweed umgebracht wurde
2370959 anstatt also bush dazu zu dr ngen sich um darfur zu sorgen wobei es unklar ist ob er da berhaupt durchblickt bringt ihn dazu sich auf m ckennetze oder auf entwurmung oder auf das jodisieren von salz in armen l ndern zu konzentrieren oder darauf da die mutter kind bertragung des virus das aids verursacht unterbunden wird oder auf viele andere bereiche in denen seine aufmerksamkeit eine humanit re wirkung entfalten k nnte
2370960 v lkermord hat immer schon eine berweltliche furcht hervorgerufen und er hat nur wenig mit der zahl der toten zu tun gehabt der holocaust ersch ttert nicht weil sechs millionen juden ermordet wurden sondern weil eine regierung menschen aufgrund ihres religi sen erbes ausgesucht hatte und versucht sie auszul schen
2370961 es gibt auch praktische argumente denn v lkermord kann kreisl ufe von rache und vertreibung verursachen und das l t ihn in einem gr eren ma e zur destabilisierung beitragen als jedwede hungersnot oder epidemie der v lkermord in darfur k nnte sehr wohl dazu f hren da der ganze sudan in b rgerkriegsschaupl tze zersplittert da die sudanesischen lexporte unterbrochen werden und da die lpreis steigen
2370962 das kollektive achselzucken der g8 staaten ber den v lkermord in darfur heute weil die opfer eh nur schwarz sind verarmt und vor den fernsehkameras verborgen wird ein fortw hrender makel bleiben
2370963 sich noch kurzsichtiger verh lt insbesondere weil die opfer in darfur alle muslime sind
2370964 z hlen tote muslime erst wenn israel der schuldige ist sollte die islamische welt nicht hundertmal mehr emp rung f r das v lkerm rderische schlachten von tausenden von muslimen aufbringen k nnen wie f r einige d nische
2370965 danach befragte ich den commander woher die waffen die er und die janjaweed milizion re benutzten stammten
2370966 ja china ist der st rkste verb ndete des sudan sie haben den gr ten vorteil aus unseren erd lertr gen aus diesem grunde h lt china starke verbindungen zum sudan aufrecht deswegen unterst tzen sie den sudan milit risch deswegen unterst tzen sie den sudan durch milit risches training durch waffen und so fort
2370967 glauben sie da china immer noch durch waffen lieferungen unterst tzt

2370971 it is an ideological cultural religious and social army that will be charged with carrying out an intellectual and scientific holy war and to free the minds hearts and souls from the secularist western onslaught and is absolutely prohibited from the use of arms
2370972 a good and a positive step in the right direction
2370973 there has been some dissent among militiamen when the news first broke about the momahidoun army

2370975 i would probably stand on my basically my reputation and say it came from the vice president

2370983 imagine a tree lets suppose this tree represents the tree of life on this tree are fruits in life our fruits are called our results so we look at the the fruits our results and we dont like them there aren t enough of them theyre too small or they dont taste good
2370984 so what do we tend to do most of us put even more atention and focus on the fruits our results but what is it that actually creates those particular fruits its the seeds and the roots that create those fruits

2370988 with cloud computer looming on the horizon it is important for us all to think of the privacy threats there as well
2370989 the tool resides with someone else and the data is stored somewhere else generally that is a bad idea
2370990 when information is in the public domain it is game over
2370991 information on your computer may get protection under the law but on someone elses it gets less protection
2370992 the information we are all giving to online companies is massive and dangerous and its going to get worse before it gets better
2370993 giving them our data is a clear and present risk
2370994 how hard would it be to target someone as a political activist or a person with aids
2370995 this is heresy but one day google will die what happens to data when a company dies is a big question

2371007 karena itulah hindarilah khamr kerana minuman itu sebagai biang keladi segala kejahatan dan perbuatan dosa ingatlah iman dengan arak tidak mungkin bersatu dalam tubuh manusia salah satu di antaranya harus keluar orang yang mabuk mulutnya akan mengeluarkan kata kata kufur dan jika menjadi kebiasaan sampai akhir ayatnya ia akan kekal di neraka

2371012 minuman apapun kalau sebanyak furq itu memabukkan maka sepenuh tapak tangan adalah haram
2371013 rasulullah s a w melaknat tentang arak sepuluh golongan 1 yang memerasnya 2 yang minta diperaskannya 3 yang meminumnya 4 yang membawanya 5 yang minta dihantarinya 6 yang menuangkannya 7 yang menjualnya yang makan harganya 9 yang membelinya 10 yang minta dibelikannya
2371014 sesungguhnya allah telah mengharamkan arak maka barangsiapa yang telah mengetahui ayat ini dan dia masih mempunyai arak walaupun sedikit jangan minum dan jangan menjualnya
2371015 barangsiapa menahan anggurnya pada musim musim memetiknya emudian dijual kepada seorang yahudi atau nasrani atau kepada tukang membuat arak maka sungguh jelas dia akan masuk neraka

2371276 there would always be one play that we dont make and weve got to make that play to keep the drive going
2371277 like ryan expressed some guys are playing good some arent
2371278 in this sport as everybody knows its not a one man show its the team the team has to win and were not getting a team effort right now
2371279 ihre zahlung ist nicht rechtzeitig eingetroffen und wir haben keine ware mehr
2371280 sergeant hennesy reporting as requested sir i have news concerning the challenge as well
2371281 well sir it turns out that grant has chosen his brother lawrence to serve as his second now that aint gonna surprise nobody but what i find peculiar is that no one will stand second for mikkelson i guess i just never noticed that mikkelson hadnt made a single friend among the other trainees a couple of the corporals have offered to volunteer if nobody comes forward but it still bothers me that the boy aint got no friends at all being a hot shot aint gonna help him none if he cant work with a squad right
2371282 well sergeant the immediate future of trainee mikkelson is one of the subjects we need to discuss tonight but first there is something personal i want to discuss with you
2371283 i told you i would match half of your losses if my strategem succeeded so be it the bag holds 185 gold crowns half of your lost goal
2371284 stop dont say even one word you told me you stood to win three hundred and seventy gold crowns plus enough silver to pay off your bar tab well since i refuse to contemplate just how large a tab you may have i choose to pay you half of your clearly stated amount and i dont want to even think about your bar tab itll just give me even more of a headache than i already have
2371285 i was very impressed by your coaching today sergeant ive been watching you for a long time now and ive been thinkong on how you handle yourself and the approaches you take to getting your duty done you show a skill in taking whats given and winning your side nearly pulled off a win this morning and i imagine most of that was due to your fast thinking and tactics when you wrent given much warning its that kind of fast decision making and turning out to have the right instincts that impresses me the most
2371286 i intend to promote you to captain of the training cadre i am sending a courier to colonel marcus west commanding officer of the border guards to inform him of the reasons i feel justified in promoting you the duchy needs more officers with your skills to lead where it counts most of the men sent here are green and they need a man such as yourself to look up to and teach them what they need to know to survive i know that you can take the recruits and make them respect what they have and strive for more
2371287 of course this will leave you the senior officer in the training cadre remaining when i leave after the challenge tomorrow morning
2371288 now hold on a minute sir what do you mean ill be in charge you cannae be leaving me here with this herd of lollies its nae right sir ill resign first thats what ill do
2371289 i have to leave in the morning sergeant the duke has sent word that he wants me to join him at his hunting lodge for the fall season this isnt the timing i would have wished but the duke has summoned me and i must obey i was detailed by the order to serve the duke in whichever way i could to help share my own experiences with the orcs in my own homeland andfprepare your forces and i knew that organizing and founding this academy was only the start of the tasks your duke would ask of me i have to leave the academy for i know not how long and before i go i will be certain in my mind that i am leaving the academy in good hands hands i can trust to get the job done
2371290 i have written up a lesson plan to help guide you in training the men for as long as i may be gone but you are the one thats going to have to make it work lieutenant darling is a decent man but he is too stodgy and strict to inspire the men to work as hard as they might your escapades are legendary throughout the guards and i am sure that if you are able to control your temper and your drinking and keep yourself under control they will follow you into the darkness itself
2371291 there are many an officer you and i have both seen that tries to act the part of the warrior and for the most part they are mild and cautious men men that have the spirit of the lamb but learn to make noises like a lion and play the part in the thick of things however they react as a lamb would and take their men down with them
2371292 its no flattery and very little in the way of kindness to be pointing out that you have the true spirit of a lion of tyr and your inability to temper your derision for the little lambs that have crossed your path has landed you in no end of trouble well you know damned well that the doneghal border guards are going to need lions to get them through the war we both know is coming here and if you will learn to act like a damn lamb around the fine gentlemen they will come to kiss your ass and carry your water for you as if you were the duke yourself
2371293 make no mistake they know themselves to be lambs and when presented with a lion they resent the living hell out of you and do what they can to make your way harder than necessary that wastes time and energy that could be best spent training and fighting if you will learn to show them the calm face and conceal your dislike behind a mask of duty they will make way for you in confusion you arent stupid and youve been in the guards long enough to know that they need someone like you to lead them and keep them from getting good men killed
2371294 i think you are capable to take on the responsibility and as the only man here that i would trust with it i need to know if you will take it can you hold on to your temper and be a fair captain to these men do you have the heart to take charge and carry this duty for me
2371295 you know there are a lot of lieutenants in the guard thatll never see captain lieutenants that ive taken a swing at one time or another no matter what bullshit yer shovelin theyll never see me as anything other than a jumped up grunt with mud on my boots and my hat in my hand out of place agang my betters aye i can do the job but ill not be making any friends for you among the other officers while im aboot doing it
2371296 any officer that takes me for an enemy over this promotion is just the kind of officer the dukes guards would be best rid of if they want to get me they can just stand in line and if any of them are stupid enough to be rude to you where you can hear of it i imagine theyd just love to face you in an engagement over a matter of a gentlemans honor
2371297 a gentleman hah unless im mistaken ill be fightin a hundred duels outside of my first year come to think thatll be one fast way to winnow out the sheep thats true
2371298 lieutenant darling at the command of his highness the duke i am to leave first thing in the morning to join him at his hunting lodge to the southeast seeing as my orders leave me no time to send for an experienced officer of sufficient rank and command experience to replace me here i have had to choose from amongst the men here to fill the need
2371299 i have followed my instincts and the guidance of tyr in making this decision and i have chosen to advance sergeant hennesy from the ranks of the enlisted men to a position as captain in the border guards to serve as provisional commanding officer of this academy in my absence you will continue on here as captain hennesys executive officer and you will continue to assist him as you have done for me
2371300 i want you to understand that this is in no way meant to be taken as a personal insult to you or as a sign of disfavor however i can not be certain that i shall be returing to this place my course will be guided by the intentions of the duke we are here at this place to see about the business of training young men to be ready for the hardest kind of war youve ever seen and the heart of it is taking real experience at the sharp end and teaching the men what really works i need the person leading that charge to be the most experienced and seasoned man that i have available one that knows which aspects of training are the most critical in a real battle in point of fact no man in the entire guards that i have yet to meet has seen more combat or experienced more of the chaos of battle than captain hennesy he may have rough edges
2371301 but he will do what he can to prepare our men for battle
2371302 i have also been instructed by the duke to bring along a squire or manservant if i have one i am choosing to take trainee mikkelson with me in the morning should he survive his challenge
2371303 hopefully this will allow lawrence to calm a bit and serve to prevent another challenge it would be a shame to lose a second trainee so soon after the first
2371304 captain hennesy has told me that lawrence will serve as grants second captain since you will be as of tomorrow morning the academys new commanding officer i want you to serve as the supervisor of the challenge mikkelson has had no one to step in to serve as his second so he shall have none
2371305 its a harsh business all around and its too late in the day for us to be trying to discover the why of his having no friends there are too many good men in this cycle for it to all be put down to jealousy there have been others of scout heritage in the guards before im sure ill get to the bottom of it on the road but it bothers me that its something i was unaware of
2371306 immediately after the challenge i want mikkelson ready to go get his things packed in the morning before the challange and a horse readied for him once the challenge is over we will be gone and gone fast after we leave if youd like you can pass along the information that mikkelson will be having a mighty hard time of it with me on the road you wont be lying and it may defuse the anger here at camp as captain hennesy so rightly pointed out a man that cannot earn the trust of his team and work together clean is a poison to any unit a man as has been here this long and is after having no friends at all is something worth getting to the bottom of and getting out of this camp with the bad blood thatll be building should he stay
2371307 now gentlemen if theres nothing else i suggest we eat and part company tomorrow will come too early for us all
2371308 well each man has his own style of getting things done and its not like i didnt know that henessys was to plant a boot up a recalcitrant soldiers butt to get him moving in the right direction
2371309 this morning we are gathered to bear witness to a challenge called by trainee franklin grant against trainee martin mikkelson in ordinary times i would be responsible for supervising the legitimacy of the challenge today
2371310 however this challenge has come at a most inopportune time yesterday i received a summons from our duke requiring me to leave immediately
2371311 this summons requires me to attend the duke at his hunting lodge in the mountains as fast as i am able to travel there to stay for the rest of the season i hold my duty to the duke very seriously and if it is his wish that i travel hard and fast then i will do so
2371312 this of course means that there shall be effective immediately a new academy commandant and i have chosen to elevate brian hennesy to captain and commanding officer of this academy
2371313 since i will be leaving immediately after the challenge it would not be proper for me to supervise it therefore captain hennesy will supervise and will take command of the remainder of these proceedings
2371314 that the start of this journey does not foreshadow how the rest of the trip shall go if so it might be wise to get better armor for mikkelson just in case
2371315 in the current debt markets it just isnt going to happen
2371316 in the current market its going to be hard for them to do any kind of securitisation
2371317 its really powerful i think its the first time that individuals have got the power
2371318 weve got authors up there publicising their books if theyre just starting out as a film producer they have the opportunity to get their content up on the site and go out to the general public to see what they actually think about it
2371319 its a hugely powerful medium and people are just starting to grasp how effective that can be
2371320 what i like about it is people can access me and access information about myself and what im working on
2371321 its a much more personal and interactive way of communicating with people out there who are actually interested in what youre doing
2371322 one of the key things for us was music which has been hugely successful for us
2371323 weve got over 100 000 bands signed up in six weeks the other thing weve really seen in the last 12 months is a trend with video
2371324 i think the future of social networks still lies in the connections between people and the potential that lies in these connections between people
2371325 if there is a possibility to pool all of this knowledge like there is in a social network to the benefit of everybody thats a really really powerful thing
2371326 beautiful people is like an elite online club where every member works the door
2371327 essentially you put up a picture and a profile where youre rated over a three day period by members of the opposite sex on whether or not they deem you attractive enough
2371328 it is not just as youd expect a dating site its become a site where people will help each other find apartments find work they have sensational parties
2371329 we cant come all this way and go through all this just to quit
2371330 this is my fifth meet in a row so i was surprised to come so close to my time from the world juniors
2371331 the race tonight hurt a bit but i think i swam it pretty well and im pleased with it
2371332 its been a big season for me and ive really improved a lot
2371333 lindsay and i have been training together for several years so it is a big thrill for me that she is at the olympics
2371334 it pumps me up to try and follow in her footsteps
2371335 i kept in control the whole way and that allowed me to come back in the last 50 i was also pleased with my reaction off the wall on the third length i got off my turn really fast

2371338 the ndf southern mindanao has likewise received rctus complaints against individuals like the lorenzos of lapanday dcwds board chairman atty eliseo braganza jun alcover and chito herbolingo of the national alliance for democracy as well as the 10th infantry division of the armed forces of the philippines for their outright attacks against the workers rights or for serving as mercenaries of the big landlord compradors
2371339 if the latter finds merit in the complaints it will endorse the rctus complaint to the proper revolutionary judicial organ for consideration and prompt action
2371340 i know two girls who were abused at the age of three and four and im doing it for them because i realise how it has impacted on their lives
2371341 i want to raise 1 million for school programs to teach victims how they can escape the horror

2371344 gloria arroyo is riding on the pro life position of the church it is rightful that the church be in front in condemning the policies and programs of a corrupt president whos no 1 in destroying and in depriving life and dignity of millions of filipinos
2371345 as a promoter of life it is righteous for the church to join the people in condemning in the strongest terms the plundering of peoples money and the abuse of power of those who is in authority
2371346 the wallet was found by a child inside a plastic floating near the seashore of baybay triumfo village

2371373 i was wrong about twitter but i wont be crossing over
2371374 in less than 90 seconds i was faced with the inescapable fact that quentin tarantinos affection for 60s and 70s exploitation fare is essentially a con as far as people with actual taste in movies is concerned and that the inglorious bastards was and is a waste of time celluloid and general expenditure
2371375 its because youre a lazy twat with the attention span of a mayfly

2371391 a good and a positive step in the right direction

2371401 hey guys why are you leaving so soon i just got here cant handle one person
2371402 you see people this cult cant even stand up to one critic
2371403 in the united states we believe that freedom of the press is an essential component of our democracy but it appears that under military order the u s government is detaining foreign journalists without basis and without due process
2371404 that runs afoul of our beliefs and the law it also interferes with our ability as citizens to get uncensored press reports from combat zones
2371405 speaking with combatants in an asymmetrical theatre of war is absolutely legitimate
2371406 journalists seek out all sides i am sure that canadian television would have demanded reporting from all sides
2371407 he yelled at me to get the belt off i told you to get the belt off so i took the belt off he ran his hands down over and pulled the pants down they went down around my ankle
2371408 she was yelling i have power i have power i have power
2371409 if somebody told me that i would save the people on the airplane by taking my pants off out in public out there i wouldnt mind doing it but this was not necessary
2371410 when youre wanding somebody and you can identify which part of the body set of the alarm that should be sufficient to clear a person

2371419 edwards told abc news correspondent bob woodruff he did have an affair with 44 year old rielle hunter but said that he did not love her
2371420 i also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby
2371421 oddly made somewhat easier after her diagnosis of breast cancer in march 2007
2371422 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognised my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness
2371423 although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public when a supermarket tabloid told a version of the story i used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it but being 99 per cent honest is no longer enough
2371424 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices and i had hoped that it would never become public with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly
2371425 but that misconduct took place for a short period in 2006
2371426 i also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby
2371427 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2371428 if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2371429 this is not the image we want from tyson foods
2371430 most of them think that when people come to america they should do as americans do instead of americans changing and adapting things the way they do in language traditions and all of that
2371431 for over a hundred years labor day has stood as a symbol to honor the working men and women of this country but for the past few years traditions like labor day have been under attack this time its gone too far and we as patriotic americans must draw our line in the sand
2371432 in america we do not need to allow substitutions and exceptions to our beloved heritage
2371433 ray also said that a lot of work needs to be done to help the somalis get along with people how to work with people and how to be kind to one another this is in reference to the frequent reports from the public of the refugees rude and demanding attitude that the t g reported in the series published in december 2007 ray said he is still working on that meeting with imam haji yousuf of shelbyvilles muslim mosque

2371435 the largest group of horse veterinarians on thursday called for changes in regulating tennessee walking horses to end the breeds culture of abuse
2371436 one of the most significant welfare issues affecting any equine breed or discipline
2371437 the infliction of pain to create an extravagant or exaggerated gait in horses for training or show purposes
2371438 documented by the u s department of agriculture s issuance of 103 competitor violations during the 2007 tennessee walking horse celebration the industrys championship event
2371439 the chances of a citation dramatically decrease when usda vets are not present
2371440 pay for a new system of objective scientific inspections similar to that employed by horse sports regulated by the u s equestrian federation
2371441 so that the innate grace and beauty of the breed are valued instead of rewarding the currently manufactured exaggerated gait

2371446 the united states calls for an immediate cease fire to the armed conflict in georgias region of south ossetia
2371447 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2371448 all parties georgians south ossetians and russians to de escalate the tension and avoid conflict
2371449 these attacks mark a dangerous and disproportionate escalation of tension as they occur across georgia in regions far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia
2371450 we are asking our friends and the united states among them to somehow to try to mediate and try to persuade russia to stop this military aggression and invasion of georgia
2371451 what we heard is that the state department and the entire administration is deeply concerned and that they are heavily engaged with russia trying to de escalate the situation
2371452 what is most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
2371453 to establish a truly independent and neutral peacekeeping force in south ossetia
2371454 all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia

2371508 john mccain has about as much chance of winning washington as the mariners do of making the playoffs
2371509 you have several exogenous factors that tend to help john mccain in the state an rather unpopular democratic governor a democratic mayor in detroit who spent last night in jail and who may impact obamas turnout operations by triggering infighting at city hall
2371510 conclusion the electoral vote distribution and therefore the model that produces it defies common sense it cannot be correct i hate to be the one to have to point out something that should be obvious to anyone who has done a basic sanity check on the numbers
2371511 michigan is the key state in this election if obama wins it he has to win either co va or oh
2371512 the chance of mccain getting less than 140 is less than 1 he could be laying next to terri schiavo and still get 140 now look at the ev distribution again

2371522 la lecci n de los ltimos 50 a os es que cuando la inflaci n echa ra ces el costo de controlarla en el futuro se refleja en un per odo prolongado de bajo crecimiento y alto desempleo
2371523 los precios suben dejando menos recursos para ser gastados en otros bienes y servicios
2371524 esto ha afectado la demanda y la producci n de algunos productos especialmente los industriales y los servicios la disminuci n en la demanda por este motivo ha generado una reducci n en el consumo de las familias superior a la que se produce por el encarecimiento del cr dito

2371527 la preocupaci n de los industriales y del gobierno radica en que en la coyuntura actual hay que darle mayor atenci n al crecimiento y el incremento en las tasas de inter s afecta esas expectativas

2371695 here in massachusetts we have never done an operation of this magnitude
2371696 that make them subject to removal from the united states
2371697 work cooperatively together to achieve a common goal of public safety in our community
2371698 this operation and ices research and enforcement efforts have impacted significantly and positively on our community and as a result made it a safer place
2371699 individuals who were arrested have been processed and will be subject to removal proceedings
2371700 should reassure the public that ice is committed to putting public safety first every individual targeted as part of this operation has a criminal record criminal aliens should be on notice that ice is working closely with local law enforcement to take off the streets those who threaten the very safety of our neighborhoods
2371701 i think ice is really working hard on its public image to depict that they are doing something to fight violent crime and in a sense they are grasping at straws because they need to bolster their image

2371730 rumsfeld and the military ignored the issue claiming that it was an unimportant social issue unconnected to fighting terrorism
2371731 when rumsfeld was pointedly asked in 2003 what the united states was doing about drugs in helmand he put the questioner down saying you ask what were going to do and the answer is i dont really know
2371732 told me how he watched convoys of opium traveling past his camp every morning but did not have orders to stop them
2371733 many of the facts dates and names he mentioned were incorrect but he was never contradicted by the two generals sitting in the room with us
2371734 after his lecture i bluntly told him that nobody believed pakistans denials about supporting the taliban the discussion went in circles but i had to be grateful that instead of arresting me musharraf had tried to engage me and change my mind however the encounter convinced me that he considered himself a master of spin and tragically believed that his spin was the absolute truth

2371739 the court record is replete with evidence that scientology is nothing in reality but a vast enterprise to extract the maximum amount of money from its adepts by pseudo scientific theories and to exercise a kind of blackmail against persons who do not wish to continue with their sect the organization clearly is schizophrenic and paranoid and this bizarre combination seems to be a reflection of its founder l ron hubbard
2371740 the effect of losing the actions could of course be grave not only for the defendants but as giving some seal of respectability to an organisation which is essentially evil

2371781 la decisi n que hemos adoptado es la mejor sin lugar a dudas
2371782 porque ten amos la necesidad de que se nos reconociera que nosotros ten amos la raz n
2371783 y despu s de que el tas nos haya dado la raz n de no tener la necesidad de liberar al jugador se iniciaron conversaciones con el jugador y con la afa el acuerdo alcanzado con afa es que se ha conseguido una compensaci n la afa se har cargo del seguro del jugador que cubrir todo el salario en caso de lesi n de messi y tenemos el compromiso personal de julio grondona de que el jugador quede liberado de todos los partidos amistosos de la temporada

2371792 after 100 years of olympic history this is the first time china has had the games
2371793 what china has tried to do through this mega event is to inform the world that its a new china with a new economy
2371794 chinas interest in the olympic movement has always been closely tied to its desire to join the world that political content will be there in this ceremony
2371795 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games

2371797 the deal offers amnesty to taliban militants and foreigners a reference to afghan arabs who are members of al qaeda in north waziristan for a pledge that they would desist from mounting cross border attacks into afghanistan assaulting pakistani security forces public servants state property tribal leaders and journalists and carrying heavy weapons dawn 6 september 2006
2371798 it binds the government to cease ground and air assaults against the taliban and resolve all future disputes according to the rivaaj tribal customs it further obligates the government to redeploy its troops from north waziristan to their designated camps and forts and dismantle all 12 checkpoints that were set up to hunt al qaeda and taliban militants dawn 6 september 2006
2371799 together these events ceding territory and releasing prisoners may constitute the most significant development in the global war on terror in the past year
2371800 taliban fighters searched government negotiators and military officers for weapons before allowing them to enter the meeting which took place in a soccer stadium in the north waziristan capital of miranshah
2371801 immediately after the pakistani delegation left flag was run up the flagpole of abandoned military checkpoints and the taliban began looting leftover small arms the taliban also held a parade in the streets of miranshah clearly they view their truce with pakistan as a victory it is trumpeted as such on jihadist websites
2371802 the destruction of safe haven in afghanistan during taliban rule has essentially been negated by the rise of talibanistan in western pakistan
2371803 according to nato statistics since the signing of the waziristan accord in september 2006 attacks into afghanistan along the border with waziristan have increased by almost 300 percent consequentially us military deaths in the region were almost double during this period in comparison to what they were during the same period the previous year further emphasising the strategic importance of the sanctuaries recent reports have indicated the al qaeda fighters wounded in afghanistan are being treated for their wounds in bajaur hospitals
2371804 within months the north waziristan accord was followed by agreements in bajaur swat and mohmand agencies news from the tribal agencies of kurram orakzai and khyber has gone dark these tribal agencies are very likely under taliban control open source reporting indicates all or portions of the settled districts of dera ismail khan laki marwat tank khyber bannu hangu kohat charsadda dir mardan and even the provincial seat of peshawar are under taliban influence to some degree or another
2371805 compulsion is not legally valid as the soul forced to kill is not better than the soul of the one killed
2371806 the government and army have become enemies of the ummah community of muslims all of them have pledged to the cross worshippers to fight true islam and its people and permitted american cross worshipper forces to use the air soil and water of pakistan the country of islam to kill the people of islam in afghanistan and then in waziristan
2371807 we in the al qaeda organisation call on allah to witness that we will retaliate for the blood of maulana abd al rasheed ghanzi
2371808 bowing to international pressure president pervez musharraf has restarted an offensive in the remote tribal areas that are rapidly becoming a hub of global terrorism yet early indications are that no matter who is in charge the pakistani army is ill suited and perhaps incapable of doing the job
2371809 if it does the army will get divided vertically with officers remaining loyal to headquarters and the rank and file becoming increasingly alienated says ayesha siddiqa author military inc a book about the pakistani army cracks are appearing she adds
2371810 lining up against the pakistani army will be the shura council of mujahideen comprising senior al qaeda and taliban commanders local clerics and leaders of the fighting clans wazir and mehsud known as the pakistani taliban
2371811 if the planned battle is successful and waziristan is pacified the global islamic resistance would be back where it was in 2003 when it had fighters but no centralised command or bases to carry out organised operations
2371812 the safety of taliban and al qaeda assets in waziristan is a matter of life and death and therefore the militants have devised a forward strategy to target the pakistani cities of lahore karachi and islamabad hoping to break the will of the pakistani armed forces
2371813 underscoring the seriousness with which the military is planning for the coming battle it is reported that shiite soldiers from northern pakistan are being sent to the waziristans in the past the pakistani army has been plagued by desertions of pashtun and sunni troops who refuse to fight fellow pashtuns or sunnis
2371814 500 leading religious scholars signed a fatwa a religious judgment ruling that militants killed in the action are martyrs the same fatwa forbade the public to pray for the dead government soldiers

2371857 rss is the basis for the concept known as the semantic web the w3cs vision of a web of information that computers can understand
2371858 it is a series of concepts and those concepts can be different per individual
2371859 the semantic web is the polar opposite of web 2 0 standardise all your data in rdf encode it in xml ok so theres also n3 but its probably mostly going to end up as xml create your owl and then once you have all this standardised data let the machines loose on it because this data is for computer consumption the sw should be more or less transparent to its users

2371941 we were branded as dangerous people because we are christians
2371942 i have been forced out of office now for more than 16 months not retired and not on staff roll of ramat polytechnic
2371943 other christian brethren too have either been forced out or have been the subjects of witch hunts
2371944 the muslim student slapped the christian student on claims that christian students were disturbing them with worship songs in a classroom
2371945 at this time we were using classrooms for our worship services bible studies and prayers because we didnt have a chapel
2371946 sensing that this ugly situation needed to be arrested we the leaders of the christian community felt that we should apply for land to build a chapel
2371947 i remember ummara calling both christian staff and students to a meeting in the school and telling us that we were in the school for educational purposes only and not for religion
2371948 he warned that he would not tolerate our request to have a chapel in the school it was from this point that we were marked out for elimination
2371949 it was baffling that in spite of this number of mosques in the institution
2371950 our demand for just a parcel of land to build a chapel became a thing for the muslim administration in the institution and in the state to use to discriminate against us leaders of the christian community and begin a witch hunt
2371951 we were recalled but later told that we must leave
2371952 after we left deacon anyetebo was also retired he died soon after because of shock and then maryam bwala became the fourth christian victim to be retired because of the chapel matter
2371953 he was suspended and dragged before security agencies and harassed several times all because of the same chapel problem
2371954 eventually they forced him out and he is currently working with the united nations country office in abuja
2371955 it is practiced in all government agencies and ministries our children too are not left out in the practice as they are denied admission in schools or even denied the teaching of their faith the christian faith
2371956 the government requested that we settle the case out of court and we did but up till now that i am speaking to you the teaching of crk has not been permitted and yet islamic religious knowledge is being taught in all schools
2371957 one catholic priest was also killed and in my church the church of christ in nigeria gambaru local congregation 82 women and two pastors were injured
2371958 i and my associate were attacked by muslims too all my theological books worth over 1 5 million naira were destroyed when the pastorate was burned by muslim militants
2371959 if you are a christian and your blood brother is a muslim
2371960 whenever there is a religious crisis he would be ready to kill you
2371961 these muslims had received assistance from these pastors in form of money food clothing etcetera
2371962 they knew where the pastors lived and so they brought their fellow muslims to kill these pastors
2371963 it is difficult today to say exactly how many christians were killed because security agents kept the figures secret
2371964 in addition they removed some corpses and buried them in a mass grave we have only been able to count those we recovered and that is the figure weve been using
2371965 i fucked up but i did what i could to repair it
2371966 we need to talk im me when you see me on
2371967 we strongly condemn this loss of innocent lives and express solidarity and condolences with the families of the deceased
2371968 we consider the killings at karachi an act of extreme cowardice and terrorism and demand that the government should ensure the safety of the lives of citizens we also demand a fair and prompt enquiry of the tragic incident and strict action against the culprits
2371969 we also call upon citizens irrespective of religion cast and creed to work for peace and harmony in the country

2371971 the community colleges are really about access and affordability and having a facility such as this in new bedford would only expand on both of those

2371973 it is certainly the most ambitious single project that our college has ever undertaken
2371974 it would be such boon to us because space is so critical

2372012 well he chews with his mouth closed which is i suppose more than you can ask of any writer
2372013 i loved dv when writing the episode did you intend on the team bonding developing moments i got out of it i e a lot of mckay teyla building on previous episodes where she seems to be able to get him to calm down and focus more as well as him beginning to value her more hi linda yes the team bonding moments were planned from the beginning we knew this episode was going to air number 4 in the schedule so teyla would still be feeling her way as a new mom whose other job was saving the galaxy getting the team trapped together seemed like a good way to get these feelings out in the open in addition these scenes provided a nice breather between the action heavy sequences loved the mckay dropping the baby comment it is so like him or at least i imagine it to be from watching the show also loved the mckay shep scene where mckay said he had to not think like himself and used sheppards idea i find a lot of humor in that kind of stuff liked that teyla was knowledgable in how to use the computers on the ship on a seperate note your daughter is beautiful yes i read end credits in s amp r did she cry on cue in the birthing scene because that was very real sounding but it looked real too
2372014 question for alan i enjoyed daedalus varaitions a lot i think the plot was excellent and hope we get more of these kind of episode my question is will we see anymore episodes with this enemy it seems this enemy in the alternate reality have establishment and sheppard points out the certain symbol on the ship and then on the dead alien i think it would be excellent if in a future episode the team comes in encounter with a ship or facility on a planet with that symbol and perhaps the enemy themselves
2372015 in my opinion sga works because of the balance between humour and serious issues between action and relationships
2372016 were there any aus you would have loved to include but couldnt what was the hardest to cut and why did it lose out over what we saw
2372017 i noticed at your page on imdb that you were man in stall in the movie american psycho care to elaborate on the experience
2372018 can you keep it down im trying to do drugs
2372019 i enjoyed daedalus variations alot but i did have a question how come the starmap on the bridge was orange instead of green was it meant to point out the fact that the ship is from a alternate universe or was it a prop error
2372020 more questions for alan in one of the realities atlantis was using f302s for fighting are we to presume that reality doesnt have puddle jumpers or theirs were all destroyed also for the new alien race did you choose how theyd look or was that a group effort will other shows coming up use some of these reality scenarios to work with in some way
2372021 does the daedalus have an automated response to turn life support down to minimal when no life signs are detected if not did the other team have a reason for doing so
2372022 i wanted to thank you for all your wonderful episodes since season four youve become one of my favorite writers on the show
2372023 questions for mr mccullough did they happen to bring one of the neat alien weapons with them to their reality could they have gotten into the space suits to get to the hangar bay for the jumper thank you for taking time to answer questions linda gagne said i on a seperate note your daughter is beautiful yes i read end credits in s amp r did she cry on cue in the birthing scene because that was very real sounding but it looked real too i i thought the ending credits said torren was annalise macculloch different spelling not sure that print is tiny and then they shove it all to the side to show yet another commercial
2372024 questions for alan how did you come up with the science to explain the incredible reality jumping in tdv did you have to consult knolwedgeable people or reference works to ensure that the science made sense ps loved the episode
2372025 some questions for mr mccullough first thank you for taking the time to participate in this forum in regards to tabula rasa how did you decide on a virus that affected memory
2372026 for alan and maybe joe as well if you can please share with us the alternate realities that you guys thought up that didnt end up in the episode like i dont know a reality where new lantia was actually unicron or something thanks
2372027 my questions for alan m re dv which i enjoyed very much
2372028 i love the episodes that isolate the team together and this was another great one would you have written dv differently if the network hadnt required five act breaks for the us market if so how would it have been different
2372029 what kind of stuff can you not put through ring transport and what would happen if you did
2372030 ok mister writer man extraordinaire can you compose a haiku about one of the episodes youve written this year
2372031 how is it that sheppard has learned to manage all stations on the big d seems he handled weaps flight and miscellaneous engineering
2372032 my question sheppard has been shown as both a smart and b able to fix ancient tech why was he being a pill and demanding rodney fix it when it would have been much faster and more productive if he helped rodney come on we like sheppard being smart and its cool hes learned from rodney this was a good chance to put it into action yes nice to work in showing teyla is learning things but they all three could have been helping rodney and teaching ronon as well or teyla could have been on the bridge they didnt show her how to fire the guns
2372033 thanks alan for guest blogging when i saw your photo on the gateworld interview page i thought you looked like someone else maybe tobey maguire perhaps grow a beard and don a spidey suit and i can decide anyhoo on with the questions 1 do you have to be very disciplined to be a writer 2 do you ever watch the episodes youve written 3 which character main or supporting do you enjoy writing best 4 whats your favourite word
2372034 it seems with joes latest taste testing endeavor that you are surrounded by crazy people someone once told me that most of the entertainment industry is completely insane and that with my background in psychology id fit right in i am working toward script writing do you feel you are the normal one in a room full of lunatics or do you include yourself to be as wakko as everyone else
2372035 what was is the most difficult or interesting script you have written for stargate atlantis or any others and why
2372036 in each of your episodes there is always at least one great mckay sheppard friendship moment is that by design in other words is there a conscious effort to include such moments in your episodes or is it just a by product of the plot whatever the reason your episodes are some of my favorite of the series thank you
2372037 how hard is it to write all the technobabble do you have a science background or do you have to do much research when writing the script
2372038 of the episodes you that have written for stargate are there any that didnt turn out quite as well as you had hoped were there any that turned out better than you had hoped also which is your favourite episode whether written by you or someone else and why thanks
2372039 alan waves ive noticed in the episodes you tend to write that theres very much a time space element to them the road not taken tabula rasa tdv line in the sand
2372040 question about the au team that died on the daedelus how did they die if they were starving why didnt they use their puddle jumper t abandon the the ship and get down to the planets mainland or was every au they came across worse than starving
2372041 i have to admit that your first sg 1 episode
2372042 comment for alan i enjoyed dv very much especially mckays comment to sheppard about being opposite of himself and sheppard praising himself for mckays benefit the teams reaction to that was hysterical question for alan in outcast what were your thoughts when you decided that sheppard would come from a wealthy family versus middle class or needy i enjoyed sheppards interacton with his older brother dave lot of feelings emotions expressed in those few short minutes they had together
2372043 to clear up any confusion there is a distinction between the way the wraith reproduce normally and the cloning technology seen in spoils of war both require the queen to secrete genetic material into pods but in the case of the cloning facility that genetic material is then copied many times over to create hundreds of wraith all at once normal wraith reproduction takes place on hive ships while its never been established my feeling is that some part of the male wraiths dna is used in the process
2372044 a little of both todd is a fun character to write for because hes always got his own agenda
2372045 dont worry the wraith arent going anywhere we love them too
2372046 to clear up any confusion there is a distinction between the way the wraith reproduce normally and the cloning technology seen in spoils of war both require the queen to secrete genetic material into pods but in the case of the cloning facility that genetic material is then copied many times over to create hundreds of wraith all at once normal wraith reproduction takes place on hive ships while its never been established my feeling is that some part of the male wraiths dna is used in the process
2372047 was this an attempt to show the limits to the characters patience or was he just hoping to get away with the ship and a few
2372048 the police administration and other prisoners constantly pressured me to convert to islam
2372049 one day an officer brought quran the muslim holy book and asked me to take it and recite the kalma the central statement of faith in islam
2372050 i told him that if being released from prison meant forsaking jesus christ then i did not want to be released
2372051 many people from different parts of the country got in touch with me and invited me into the fold of islam promising to get me out of prison but i flatly refused them all
2372052 during this trying time hundreds of cards and letters poured in from around the world strengthening my faith and encouraging me to fight back and resist evil i am thankful to jesus for all the encouragement and love
2372053 during my imprisonment i was beaten everyday they blind folded me tied my hands behind my back tied my feet and then beat me with clubs sticks kicking and slapping me they treated me worse than the animals
2372054 when i was first brought to the prison the jail administrator announced that no one was allowed to talk to me on many occasions they locked me in a cell all day
2372055 i had to bribe the guards to let me out of my cell for one or two hours they often gave me very tough work to do throughout all this it was his grace and love that helped me to remain steadfast
2372056 the guards asked me to name other christians so that they could arrest and implicate them on one occasion they took me to a remote area and told me to run away i refused and told them that they would have to kill me and tell the world that i was killed in a police encounter
2372057 another time they beat me almost senseless trying to get me to name a fellow believer
2372058 you were beating me to make me speak now i am speaking and you have problem with that
2372059 during the past eight years my wife and children have suffered greatly but they have shown immense courage patience and forbearance i am thankful to jesus for my wonderful family
2372060 one day my grand daughter visited me in jail she comforted me with the gentle reminder that jesus would get me out at his appointed time
2372061 they worked tirelessly to get me out of prison when i was first arrested my wife asked everyone we knew to help with my case including some influential christian clergy but at that time none of them helped us claas is the only group who was willing to take on my case because of this i am so thankful to god for them
2372062 the atrocious conditions in the jail and repeated beatings ranjha suffered
2372063 i find great stores through this and that but every time i try to buy from store i have to re enter the same billing shipping and credit card information

2372095 the power under the constitution will always be in the people it is intrusted for certain defined purposes and for a certain limited period to representatives of their own choosing and whenever it is executed contrary to their interest or not agreeable to their wishes their servants can and undoubtedly will be recalled
2372096 this constitution and the laws of the united states which shall be made in pursuance thereof and all treaties made or which shall be made under the authority of the united states shall be the supreme law of the land and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby anything in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding

2372098 whensoever the general government assumes undelegated powers its acts are unauthoritative void and of no force
2372099 no legislative act contrary to the constitution can be valid
2372100 the purpose of a written constitution is to bind up the several branches of government by certain laws which when they transgress their acts shall become nullities to render unnecessary an appeal to the people or in other words a rebellion on every infraction of their rights on the peril that their acquiescence shall be construed into an intention to surrender those rights

2372105 the power under the constitution will always be in the people
2372106 if a juror accepts as the law that which the judge states then that juror has accepted the exercise of absolute authority of a government employee and has surrendered a power and right that once was the citizens safeguard of liberty

2372149 all of us are under no illusions that that wasnt their most devastating performance
2372150 there were times there i think coach matty elliott said that they were toying with us a bit
2372151 it makes us realise the level that we have to get to in order to be competitive
2372152 she said that she would dance with me if i brought her red roses
2372153 but in all my garden there is no red rose
2372154 ah on what little things does happiness depend i have read all that the wise men have written and all the secrets of philosophy are mine yet for want of a red rose is my life made wretched
2372155 night after night have i sung of him though i knew him not night after night have i told his story to the stars and now i see him his hair is dark as the hyacinth blossom and his lips are red as the rose of his desire but passion has made his face like pale ivory and sorrow has set her seal upon his brow
2372156 and my love will be of the company if i bring her a red rose she will dance with me till dawn if i bring her a red rose i shall hold her in my arms and she will lean her head upon my shoulder and her hand will be clasped in mine but there is no red rose in my garden so i shall sit lonely and she will pass me by she will have no heed of me and my heart will break
2372157 what i sing of he suffers what is joy to me to him is pain surely love is a wonderful thing it is more precious than emeralds and dearer than fine opals pearls and pomegranates cannot buy it nor is it set forth in the marketplace it may not be purchased of the merchants nor can it be weighed out in the balance for gold
2372158 and play upon their stringed instruments and my love will dance to the sound of the harp and the violin
2372159 as white as the foam of the sea and whiter than the snow upon the mountain but go to my brother who grows round the old sun dial and perhaps he will give you what you want
2372160 as yellow as the hair of the mermaiden who sits upon an amber throne and yellower than the daffodil that blooms in the meadow before the mower comes with his scythe but go to my brother who grows beneath the students window and perhaps he will give you what you want
2372161 as red as the feet of the dove and redder than the great fans of coral that wave and wave in the ocean cavern but the winter has chilled my veins and the frost has nipped my buds and the storm has broken my branches and i shall have no roses at all this year
2372162 only one red rose is there no way by which i can get it
2372163 but it is so terrible that i dare not tell it to you
2372164 you must build it out of music by moonlight and stain it with your own you must sing to me with your breast against a thorn all night long you must sing to me and the thorn must pierce your heart and your life blood must flow into my veins and become mine
2372165 death is a great price to pay for a red rose
2372166 and life is very dear to all it is pleasant to sit in the green wood and to watch the sun in his chariot of gold and the moon in her chariot of pearl sweet is the scent of the hawthorn and sweet are the bluebells that hide in the valley and the heather that blows on the hill yet love is better than life and what is the heart of a bird compared to the heart of a man
2372167 be happy you shall have your red rose i will build it out of music by moonlight and stain it with my own all that i ask of you in return is that you will be a true lover for love is wiser than philosophy though she is wise and mightier than power though he is mighty flame coloured are his wings and coloured like flame is his body his lips are sweet as honey and his breath is like frankincense
2372168 that cannot be denied to her but has she got feeling i am afraid not in fact she is like most artists she is all style without any sincerity she would not sacrifice herself for others she thinks merely of music and everybody knows that the arts are selfish still it must be admitted that she has some beautiful notes in her voice what a pity it is that they do not mean anything or do any practical good
2372169 or the day will come before the rose is finished
2372170 or the day will come before the rose is finished
2372171 you said that you would dance with me if i brought you a red rose
2372172 here is the reddest rose in all the world you will wear it to night next your heart and as we dance together it will tell you how i love you
2372173 i am afraid it will not go with my dress
2372174 and besides the chamberlains nephew has sent me some real jewels and everybody knows that jewels cost far more than flowers
2372175 i tell you what you are very rude and after all who are you
2372176 it is not half as useful as logic for it does not prove anything and it is always telling one of things that are not going to happen and making one believe things that are not true in fact it is quite unpractical and as in this age to be practical is everything i shall go back to philosophy and study metaphysics

2372208 you know heavy feeling of tiredness which hangs just beyond your eyes in the morning where one stands and feels groggy but not wholly useless it would be the most accurate metaphor to describe how i always feel
2372209 that the wretchedness of my existence is manifest in the cloud which hangs about my eyes my mind and my soul i thought to my heart as i strolled that perhaps god himself will send me an angel a man more vile then i but yet more apt to action confronting me he will sweep me of my existence that maybe i might be lifted of the burden of doing away with my own vileness by a reprobate more downtrodden then i i have not as of yet had the honor of meeting such a saint
2372210 oh thou become a flower when one was once not but a knife
2372211 forgive me it is not i that speak but a foreign demon something which seems so vicious and hate filled that it consumes me its name i know not but with melancholic brooding it surfaces it as a pot left to boil yields spite and self piety leaping out to scald all which stand close
2372212 no its not ok how am i to be peaceful with myself when inside there sits such an evil such a poison oh i might learn to express myself artfully in subtle cleverness yet its meaningless when one expresses for one wish ardently to be rid of that self
2372213 are nothing but an attempt to quell the demon that they are not expressions of my heart but are actually intertwined with my demon that it is the one that should be praised not i laughable that the demon itself is of more value then i ha
2372214 drake you know this to be false why do you speak so strangely
2372215 it is not i that speak but the demon you see i speak strangely for it is the demon do you understand
2372216 of course you would not understand who is to understand
2372217 i wrote these in utter agony you know but what are they now i dont feel better they didnt cure me of this sickness nor did they serve to make me happier after the fact now they lay mocking me speaking of how my sickness is but an engine for expression i want to read one to you if thats ok
2372218 oh woe a hopeless despair sinks in having no recollection of where i have thusly traveled i am lost no trail to follow no guide hope where has it run to faith has it escaped leaving only melancholy and despair at my flanks both with glee escort me further within each cold decaying hand upon my shoulder i am to meet my fate surrounded by daemons ready to hold me upon the cold ground i call for light within pleading to the evils for release what greets me are eyes without expression the lurking horrors that dwell within the evils of darkness im reprobate cast off alone among those who wish to lead me astray an icy wind flows through my whole self as if i was naked exposed to all i shudder
2372219 now it is i look back at these words and i shake my head i think to myself that the demon which invests so much in my suffering is now not just within the breast but actually manifests itself in front of me now so it can torment me even when it is not me understand

2372289 the opinion is unfortunate and in my opinion wrong the court places itself in the position of judging the legitimacy of native american beliefs and practices it becomes the arbiter of religion which is not the proper role for the courts the evidence clearly shows that the peaks are important to 13 of the tribes in the southwestern united states and that using sewer water to make snow on them constitutes a significant burden on the tribes ability to practice their religion
2372290 in so holding the majority misstates the evidence below misstates the law under rfra and misunderstands the very nature of religion
2372291 the sierra club will continue to support our tribal partners to bring as much protection to the peaks as possible and will continue to educate the public about the importance of protecting sacred lands located on public lands from irresponsible developments like artificial snowmaking

2372307 the cultural survival of more than 13 indigenous nations is directly intertwined with the environmental integrity of the holy san francisco peaks
2372308 todays decision not only places these ways of life in peril but sets the stage for an ecological and public health catastrophe we have no choice but to uphold our commitment to protect the holy san francisco peaks
2372309 only effect of the proposed upgrades is on the plaintiffs subjective emotional religious experience that is the presence of recycled wastewater on the peaks is offensive to the plaintiffs religious sensibilities the diminishment of spiritual fulfillment serious though it may be is not a substantial burden on the free exercise of religion
2372310 the court places itself in the position of judging the legitimacy of native american beliefs and practices it becomes the arbiter of religion which is not the proper role for the courts the evidence clearly shows that the peaks are important to 13 of the tribes in the southwestern united states and that using sewer water to make snow on them constitutes a significant burden on the tribes ability to practice their religion
2372311 in this country native americans have no first amendment rights when it comes to government land use decisions
2372312 the federal government likely holds thousands of acres of land that tribes hold sacred this case was the last best chance for the tribes to be able to provide some legal protection to those lands in a nation that prides itself on religious liberty it is unconscionable that native american beliefs are not respected under the law or the constitution we anticipate petitioning the u s supreme court for review of this matter
2372313 this ruling sets a negative precedent that impacts the future of native american religious practice
2372314 religious exercise invariably and centrally involves a subjective spiritual experience
2372315 the majoritys misunderstanding of the nature of religious beliefs and exercise as merely
2372316 rfra was passed to protect the exercise of all religions including the religions of american indians if indians land based exercise of religion is not protected by rfra in this case i cannot imagine a case in which it will be i am truly sorry that the majority has effectively read american indians out of rfra
2372317 this decision is a painful affirmation of the lack of protection for our religious freedom
2372318 it is a bitter reminder that not all citizens are equal in this country but just as the civil rights movement did not give up when courts delivered blow after blow we will not give up until our rights are fully upheld we the youth will continue to stand up for our cultural survival
2372319 federal land management policies are inconsistent when addressing native american religious practice relating to sacred places this case underscores the fact that we need legislative action to guarantee protection for places held holy by native american tribes
2372320 the deeply held religious beliefs of hundreds of thousands of citizens of this country have been trumped by a single for profit private business operating on public lands
2372321 eight of eleven judges decided to completely ignore the issue of what happens if a child were to eat this snow
2372322 the court dismissed the whole health issue on a procedural error thereby refusing to comment on the true health impacts of this fake snow which has been proven to contain harmful pharmaceuticals and personal care productions on our children the court has obviously cast off this responsibility and we will continue to demand accountability for our children and the land
2372323 we obviously disagree with ruling snowmaking with sewage is still plainly a bad idea

2372359 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
2372360 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2372361 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2372362 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2372363 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all

2372445 the overriding problem is that the bush administration has said that hamdan will be held until the war on terror is over regardless of what sentence he gets
2372446 it is almost kafkaesque that regardless of what the sentence might be and whatever credit he is given for his prior detention they are saying they are going to hold him until the war ends and everyone knows that is virtually limitless
2372447 for all the governments attempts to paint the commissions as another nuremberg they remain utterly outside the law and will be mired in challenges for years to come hamdan was convicted based on laws that were passed long after he was picked up and the commission allowed coerced evidence both illegal under not only international law but u s law as well
2372448 hamdans trial revealed what is common knowledge the military commissions are fatally flawed and do not adhere to major aspects of the rule of law hamdan suffered nearly seven years of unlawful detention only to face a process that falls far short so far the trial continues the bush administrations efforts to escape the rule of law and the requirements of justice
2372449 the trial was a show trial the rules of evidence are so tilted in the governments favor that the tribunal is ill designed for getting at truth its hard to credit any verdict though its telling that the executive failed to win the entire case even in its contrived system that however in no way proves the system is fair or that it works
2372450 this is an enormously compelling indication of how independent the process has been
2372451 the problem is the law was specifically written after the fact to target mr hamdan
2372452 the power to proceed because its structures and procedures violate both the uniform code of military justice and the four geneva conventions signed in 1949

2372461 at present approximately two thirds of world trade is conducted in dollars and two thirds of central banks currency reserves are held in the american currency which remains the sole currency used by international institutions such as the imf this confers on the us a major economic advantage the ability to run a trade deficit year after year it can do this because foreign countries need dollars to repay their debts to the imf to conduct international trade and to build up their currency reserves the us provides the world with these dollars by buying goods and services produced by foreign countries but since it does not have a corresponding need for foreign currency it sells far fewer goods and services in return

2372470 the president has no inviolable constitutional prerogative to nominate us attorneys
2372471 instead us attorneys are inferior officers under article ii section 2 of the constitution and are nominated by the president because congress has provided for that authority
2372472 appears to be outside the scope of the committees investigative authority which is limited to areas which congress may legislate and instructed the rnc not to produce the category two documents at this time
2372473 accordingly the rnc is awaiting a determination by the white house as to whether it will invoke executive privilege over those documents
2372474 in the meantime the rnc is proceeding deliberately and cautiously by withholding them pending the outcome of the white houses discussion with the committee and concerning the white houses decision concerning invoking the privilege
2372475 willing to accept your invitation to meet with your staff together with representatives of the white house counsels office to discuss these issues in greater detail
2372476 the executive cannot identify a single judicial opinion that recognizes absolute immunity for senior presidential advisors in this or any other context
2372477 that simple yet critical fact bears repeating the asserted absolute immunity claim here is entirely unsupported by existing case law
2372478 the aspect of this lawsuit that is unprecedented is the notion that ms miers is absolutely immune from compelled congressional process the supreme court has reserved absolute immunity for very narrow circumstances involving the presidents personal exposure to suits for money damages based on his official conduct or concerning matters of national security or foreign affairs the executives current claim of absolute immunity from compelled congressional process for senior presidential aides is without any support in the case law
2372479 harriet miers is not immune from compelled congressional process she is legally required to testify pursuant to a duly issued congressional subpoena
2372480 the court once again emphasizes the narrow scope of todays decision the court holds only that ms miers and other senior presidential advisors do not have absolute immunity from compelled congressional process in the context of this particular subpoena dispute
2372481 there may be some instances where absolute or qualified immunity is appropriate for such advisors but this is not one of them
2372482 y our client has declined to produce or itemize the subpoenaed documents relying on the very executive privilege claim that was considered by judge bates and you have previously indicated that the rnc would adhere to the terms of a court resolution of the dispute between the committee and the executive
2372483 accordingly i expect you will provide any non privileged documents that your client possesses and an appropriate list and description of any subpoenaed documents that you continue to withhold
2372484 a limited number of u s attorneys could be targeted for removal and replacement

2372718 the first thing western societies did was to separate religion and state
2372719 from the age of three or four the killings of girls begin cover your knees
2372720 we do not want a secular state the arab countries are not secular states we have our religion and the sharia and we have values that we must preserve modernity is desirable we all want modernity but when it runs counter to our values customs and traditions it must be rejected every person in this world lives according to the social values that he absorbs we must reject the erasing of our identity
2372721 jack san you want yojis advice about the babes you come to yoji with respect

2372723 i am deeply honored to merit a link from solomon who lives up to the venerated ancient name with his wisdom and sagacity

2372725 if their father is willing to continue risking his livelihood in order to continue chopping up animals in a laboratory than his children are old enough to recognize the consequences said vlasak a former animal researcher who is now a trauma surgeon
2372726 this guy knows what he is doing he knows that every day that he goes into the laboratory and hurts animals that it is unreasonable not to expect consequences
2372727 the inconvenience and the suffering of any children or any family members pales in comparison to the suffering and oppression that goes on in these animal laboratories
2372728 putting himself and his family in harms way by continuing to abuse animals
2372729 we must not allow a violent minority to dictate the future of medicine
2372730 my child has down syndrome a form of mental retardation and i am sad that you would find your shirt humorous

2372732 my goal this year is to prove natural selection on the show its gonna take a while its gonna be very hard to make it fascinating on film in the context of our narrative structure but i figure screw it the skys the limit lets do lets do natural selection im sick of fifty percent of this country thinking creationism is reasonable its appalling and i have the unique ability maybe to sell this idea to discovery and theyll they might allow me to do it and im gonna try as hard as i can

2372745 democrats this week chose the prayer of alternative energy over proven prosperity theyve handed prosperity in the here and now to the republicans run with it
2372746 this is the willie horton of 2008 the issue that we have to take back and own or lose
2372747 remember the cheapest form of energy is the energy we dont need to buy in the first place and yet even while americans are worried about making their dollar stretch as far as it can the tremendous power of energy efficiency is being dismissed leadership is the missing ingredient strong forward thinking leaders would 1 show americans that efficiency isnt about sacrifice its about ingenuity high tech solutions and saving money 2 enact policies that give car makers tire manufacturers and motor oil companies incentives to make more efficient products
2372748 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2372749 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2372750 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2372751 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2372752 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2372753 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2372754 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2372755 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2372756 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2372757 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2372758 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2372759 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2372760 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2372761 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2372762 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2372763 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2372764 what drives the nader gonzales campaign clearly is the country is in deep trouble
2372765 the giant corporations are tearing the heart and soul out of america in so many ways the corporate crime wave being the more recent one and john mccain and barack obama are ignoring corporate crime they want a bigger military budget they want to stay in iraq they want to expand the war in afghanistan and theyre not good on consumer protection at all
2372766 theyre using a lot of money in their campaigns from commercial interests and in many ways theyre similar
2372767 theyre not really for a living wage theyre both opposed to a canadian style health care system which gives you free choice of doctor and hospital hows that for starters
2372768 no one dies in canada because they cant afford health insurance everyone has it but 18 000 americans die every year according to the national academy of scientists because they cant afford health insurance
2372769 so it does not subordinate environmental consumer and labour rights to the supremacy of commercial power
2372770 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to continue counterterroism missions in iraq against al qaeda
2372771 bush burned down a haystack to try to find a couple of needles he didnt find the needles but there have been 1000s of innocent deaths
2372772 a nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death
2372773 i dont really have anything worthwhile to say but i might as well bash harper since thats the in thing to do
2372774 in canada you get to choose your own doctor and hospital
2372775 before the decade is out to put a man on the moon and return him safely to the earth
2372776 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2372777 it would be impossible to solely credit the surge for the turn around
2372778 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2372779 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices
2372780 with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly
2372781 and i think they need to work through that process of healing my sense is that thats going to be their top priority
2372782 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2372783 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2372784 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2372785 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2372786 i am proud of the courage john showed by his honesty in the face of shame
2372787 i ask that the public who expressed concern about the harm johns conduct has done to us think also about the real harm that the present voyeurism does and give me and my family the privacy we need at this time
2372788 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false
2372789 used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it
2372790 mad she was angry furious would be a good way to describe it
2372791 she should not be involved in protecting me from whatever the consequences of this are
2372792 my lord and my wife have forgiven me and so im going to move on i think our marriage will not only survive it will be strong
2372793 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2372794 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2372795 the expanded use of pills and insurance policies that favor short office visits
2372796 47 report a history of medication but no therapy more than a third 34 report a history of both medication and therapy and 19 report a history of therapy but no medication
2372797 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2372798 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2372799 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2372800 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2372801 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2372802 just so you all know we did set a record
2372803 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2372804 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2372805 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2372806 there are good muslims and bad muslims that i have to admit just like there are good and bad jews
2372807 no this was their place first they could take the hot weather and some of them went far in this world theyre not lazy
2372808 i know hes smart i dont think hes a dummy like bush
2372809 im fine i have to go for blood work again they keep me waiting for an hour im all sunburned like a berry i get in the water and i forget to get out i get in conversations
2372810 the first phone call i placed was answered cordially i was told that someone would get back to me i never heard back from anyone
2372811 the second time i called the person i was speaking with hung up and the third time i called the line was disconnected
2372812 i had them draw all that instead and then i brought the drawings to the mayor
2372813 i started crying in the mayors office because i was a child in this town and i remember the glory days of longbrook park when people cared enough to take care of things
2372814 when i go down there i expect the towns public works can have one plumber come and make sure theres a water supply for the children and workable toilets
2372815 you then lock it all up at night so the vandals dont get in what is so difficult about this
2372816 there was also this red mold growing in the sink
2372817 the majority of her complaints that shocked the conscience if you will had to do with vandalism done probably by youths who obviously need better supervision who have no manners or respect
2372818 a new york cop goes undercover in the world of parkour aka free running in order to track down a gang of sly bank robbers
2372819 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
2372820 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
2372821 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
2372822 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
2372823 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
2372824 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2372825 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2372826 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2372827 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2372828 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2372829 i have a recommendation but its not of a person and i shared this with them back in march
2372830 wait till the democrat convention is over and see who they pick youll have more information
2372831 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
2372832 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
2372833 the global warming climate change issue is so important that people on both sides of the issue including policymakers should be fully informed before policy is actually formulated tragically thats not happening in the global warming issue
2372834 many things we thought we knew about the climate system just a few years ago are now proving to be uncertain or quite mistaken
2372835 its become quite news worthy to go out and tell people that we are about to have an apocalyptic climate change and the moment you make that announcement its easy to go around the world and find things to support that viewpoint
2372836 the ipcc is a political organization setup by the un to provide evidence to support the framework convention on climate change its entirely political they made up what they were going to do beforehand and choose whatever science they ipcc could find to support their theory
2372837 this cuts at the heart of national sovereignty of the u s we would be saying that we would allow an international body to come in and dictate to our industries our businesses our people what they can do and what they cant do the use of what energy the sources of energy the cost of energy etc
2372838 carbon dioxide gas co2 lags behind temperature changes in history by 800 years co2 doesnt cause temperature change
2372839 based on the evidence of ice core studies at the polar ice caps it shows that co2 follows temperature not the opposite so the fundamental assumption of the whole theory of climate change by human intervention of co2 emissions causing temperature changes is wrong
2372840 human intervention accounts for a small fraction of co2 of the atmospheric gases in the atmosphere that water vapor accounts for about 97 of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere co2 accounts for 1 9 therefore man is responsible for less than 3 of all greenhouse effect in the atmosphere globally
2372841 0 55f 0 30c cooler than the 1971 2000 average
2372842 my concern is that we may be moving away from an irrational lack of concern about climate change to an equally irrational panic about it
2372843 the problem is that in this panic we are going to spend our money unwisely we will take actions that are counterproductive and we will fail to do many of those things that will benefit the environment and ourselves for example right now the clearest threat to many species is habitat destruction take the orangutans for instance one of those charismatic species that people are often fascinated by and concerned about they are endangered because of deforestation in our fear of global warming it would be sad if we fail to find funds to purchase those forests before they are destroyed and thus let this species go extinct at the heart of the matter is how much faith we decide to put in science even how much faith scientists put in science our times have benefited from clear thinking science based rationality i hope this prevails as we try to deal with our changing climate
2372844 co founder of ipcc al gore is trying to be a climate change profiteer essentially he wants to make a fortune by creating a new market for a product that he is attempting to create by legislative fiat if he succeeds and carbon emissions trading comes to the united states al gore will be uniquely positioned to cash in hes made sure of that
2372845 gore himself is chairman and founder of a private equity firm called generation investment management gim he says the london based firm invests money from institutions and wealthy investors in companies that are becoming environmentally friendly to use green parlance gim appears to have considerable influence over major carbon credit trading firms the u s based chicago climate exchange ccx and the u k based carbon neutral company cnc ccx appears to be the only firm in the u s that claims to trade carbon credits as a politician gore speaks warmly of transparency but as gim chairman gore has not been forthcoming little is known about his shadowy firms finances where it gets funding and what projects it supports
2372846 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2372847 the consensus in kyoto as outlined in the ipcc report will bind america to reduce energy consumption by 25 which will have a devastating effect on the american standard of living and the u s economy it will continue to drive more industries out of america for a more global economy
2372848 for climate changes he glosses over that this local planetary system is in constant change and we cant accurately measure the recent relatively small changes and anthropogenic contributions are an open question
2372849 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
2372850 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
2372851 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both

2372860 empire of debt the rise of an epic financial crisis
2372861 the honest truth is that we have too many people in washington living for today rather than saving for tomorrow
2372862 give americans a good talking to about the countrys sloppy debt habits
2372863 the american people are a lot smarter than people give them credit for
2372864 comment by bruce in miami august 8 2008 at 9 54 am
2372865 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
2372866 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
2372867 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
2372868 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
2372869 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
2372870 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2372871 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
2372872 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
2372873 we are looking at options and ways that we can streamline the command and control arrangements for u s forces in afghanistan
2372874 this is not a finished action this is not a done deal by any means
2372875 although it would be one commander in charge of both missions the missions would not be blended in any way
2372876 so youd have the isaf mission and youd have the oef mission and theyd remain separate and distinct
2372877 so youve got u s forces that are not all under the command of a single u s officer in afghanistan
2372878 the influence of polling location on voting found in our research would be more than enough to change the outcome of a close election
2372879 voting at a school could increase support for school spending or voting at a church could decrease support for stem cell initiatives
2372880 environmental cues such as objects or places can activate related constructs within individuals and influence the way they behave
2372881 voting in a school for example could activate the part of a persons identity that cares about kids or norms about taking care of the community similarly voting in a church could activate norms of following church doctrine such effects may even occur outside an individuals awareness
2372882 we want factors like political views whether someone thinks a candidate is going to make our country a better place to sway elections
2372883 but in forming election policy we also want to make sure that arbitrary factors such as polling location dont ultimately influence voting behaviors
2372884 what our research suggests is that it might be useful to further investigate influences such as polling location to better understand how such factors affect different types of voting situations
2372885 axelrods not the type to drop a refrigerator on a guys head hell take the refrigerator apart drop one piece at a time and save the biggest piece for last
2372886 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2372887 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
2372888 this is a classic washington story anonymous quotes from armchair quarterbacks with no sense of our strategy data or plan
2372889 friedman tells stories well with a keen eye for wars absurdities and his own fading illusions of wars glory

2372891 a time to lead confirms the rewarding benefits of military service at a time when such service is experiencing considerable strain it also includes a comprehensive description of americas current national imperatives which deserve serious consideration

2372895 there are many physicians who do not believe fibromyalgia exists
2372896 i believe it exists and try to treat it sometimes successfully and sometimes not
2372897 i thought girl get up from this chair i went to the break room to try to regain some kind of energy and my knees buckled i made an appointment that day
2372898 i would hear it must be in your head because those symptoms were not a part of rheumatoid arthritis
2372899 the diagnosis was confirmation that its not all in my head
2372900 but at the same time i felt a tremendous sense of urgency because there is no cure
2372901 it is very possible the patient may return to normal but i tell my patients that they will never completely be rid of the illness and that they need to make lifestyle choices which will ease their discomfort
2372902 like ive been run over by an 18 wheeler im always on some level of pain sometimes its a one or two on a scale of one to 10 other days its a 10 plus most days its a six you must fill out the comment body in order to submit a comment at left sisters shirlene millert jacqueline miller brown and carol miller mccrackin all suffer from fibromyalgia jackson miss rheumatologist neal shparago said the medical community believes there is a genetic link associated with the chronic pain disease
2372903 well hollywoods all about money they just make what sells
2372904 vacate its earlier order holding that 1 a non exempt employee is entitled to a meal period for each five hour block of time worked and 2 the premium pay owed for a violation of section 226 7 is a wage
2372905 a separate meal period must be provided for each five hour block of time worked regardless of the total hours worked in the day in other words the court interpreted the law to be that o nce a meal period concludes the proverbial clock starts ticking again and if the employee works five hours more a second meal period must be provided
2372906 nothing in s ection 512 requires a second meal period be provided solely because the employee works five hours after the end of the first meal period where the total time worked is less than 10 hours
2372907 does not dictate the anomalous result that meal periods must be provided every five hours
2372908 gets a meal period at some point during the workday

2372912 class members who worked one or more work periods in excess of three and a half 3
2372913 class members who worked one or more work periods in excess of five 5 consecutive hours without receiving a thirty 30 minute meal period during which the class member was relieved of all duties from and after october 1 2000
2372914 class members who worked off the clock or without pay from and after august 16 2000
2372915 fail ing to provide rest periods for every four hours or major fraction thereof worked per day to non exempt employees and failing to provide compensation for such unprovided rest periods
2372916 no employer shall require any employee to work during any meal or rest period mandated by an applicable order of the iwc
2372917 insofar as practicable shall be in the middle of each work period
2372918 discretion to not have rest periods in the middle of a work period if because of the nature of the work or the circumstances of a particular employee it is not practicable
2372919 provide meal periods for days on which non exempt employees work ed in excess of five hours or by failing to provide meal periods altogether or to provide second meal periods for days employees worked in excess of 10 hours and failing to provide compensation for such unprovided or improperly provided meal periods
2372920 presented corporate policy evidence of a pattern and practice by brinker of failing to provide a rest period prior to employees meal period as a result of its practice of scheduling meals early
2372921 brinker maintains company wide policies discouraging rest periods including requiring servers to give up tables and tips if they want a break and failing to provide rest periods
2372922 must be given before an employees work period exceeds five hours
2372923 the dlse wants employers to provide employees with break periods and
2372924 appears to be in violation of section 512 by not providing a meal period per every five hours of work
2372925 no employer shall employ any person for a work period of more than five 5 hours without a meal period of not less than 30 minutes except that when a work period of not more than six 6 hours will complete the days work the meal period may be waived by mutual consent of the employer and the employee

2372927 a n employer may not employ an employee for a work period of more than 10 hours per day without providing the employee with a second meal period of not less than 30 minutes
2372928 its sad to know that there are some people that cant be trusted chris wagner is one of them
2372929 i was hunted and not only was i hunted but it was by another man that man over there christopher william wagner
2372930 he is unmistakably a violent criminal and they let him go they failed to keep him in jail then reduced his bond i am ashamed and angry at their actions or lack thereof the colorado justice system was simply a failure and one that almost cost me my life
2372931 took a wrong turn when she murdered our child she drove me off the road i was hoping she could be my tow truck for the past few years ive been living with this wreck
2372932 i changed my name because i couldnt stand chris wagner nobody can grasp what it means to be me
2372933 i do feel bad that this happened the shoot out now so many people hate me
2372934 make no mistake about it mr wagner is the most dangerous person who has ever appeared before this court
2372935 the defendant maintains his innocence and claims hes sorry for his actions but he takes no responsibility for it he still claims he did nothing wrong and we cant rehabilitate someone who has done nothing wrong
2372936 showed that the southwest museum was not economically feasible solely as a museum
2372937 based on the projected operating losses of these two hypothetical models options a amp b we do not believe it is economically feasible to operate the site exclusively as a museum
2372938 its not my job i didnt say it in an ugly tone of voice
2372939 i was already freaked out because she was accusing me of stuff i didnt do
2372940 you dont go to jail because you like different restaurants do you
2372941 lots of operable windows for natural daylight and free ventilation
2372942 but kitchens are especially enjoyable for family and guests when they are bright cheerful and free of stale cooking odors heat and humidity
2372943 venting skylights can utilize their natural chimney effect to exhaust not only kitchen air but to vent volatile organic compounds vocs and other indoor air pollutants from other areas of the home as well
2372944 the first few times you take some of them they are so crippled they cant even sit in a chair
2372945 there was one little girl i took for eight years and when she first started going to the hospitals there didnt seem any chance of her walking i was privileged to take her to greenville last year for her last trip
2372946 when she walked out of that clinic she walked just as straight as you and me
2372947 she had a great big grin on her face and i knew she had been released she came up and hugged my neck
2372948 after you take them for a while these people are family
2372949 and the best thing about it is we do the best work in the world for orthopedic burns and spinal cords
2372950 one day we asked ourselves whats wrong with writing about our kids
2372951 we raised tobacco and after we paid the taxes and fertilizer we didnt have anything left
2372952 this is without a doubt the most satisfying thing i have done in my life
2372953 we have a banking crisis and an agency crisis and a mortgage crisis and a coming credit card crisis weve never seen anything like that before and it all seems to be coming home to roost at the same time thats never happened either
2372954 but we did not even have credit cards in the 1930s there were no such thing as student loans
2372955 what ive said is that im playing the hand that was dealt and that my responsibility is to protect the u s economy and the american people
2372956 the intellectual elite causing an impression of loss of courage by the entire society should one point out that from ancient times decline in courage has been considered the beginning of the end
2372957 the constant desire to have still more things and a still better life and the struggle to obtain them imprints many western faces with worry and even depression the majority of people have been granted well being to an extent their fathers and grandfathers could not even dream about
2372958 today well being in the life of western society has begun to reveal its pernicious mask
2372959 the defense of individual rights has reached such extremes as to make society as a whole defenseless against certain individuals it is time in the west to defend not so much human rights as human obligations
2372960 destructive and irresponsible freedom has been granted boundless space society appears to have little defense against the abyss of human decadence such as for example misuse of liberty for moral violence against young people motion pictures full of pornography crime and horror
2372961 a false slogan characteristic of a false era people also have the right not to know and it is a much more valuable one the right not to have their divine souls stuffed with gossip nonsense vain talk a person who works and leads a meaningful life does not need this excessive burdening flow of information
2372962 through intense suffering our country has now achieved a spiritual development of such intensity that the western system in its present state of spiritual exhaustion does not look attractive
2372963 when they arrived a number of residents were pointing there fingers at mr scott ryan saying he was the driver
2372964 mr scott ryan was holding his jaw he had no injuries and a blood test found he was under the limit
2372965 in interview he said he knew he was disqualified from driving and said he was going to the shop
2372966 he also added he was driving at 15 miles per hour
2372967 he suffers post traumatic stress and depression going back to 1996 when he was kidnapped at gunpoint and held for a number of hours
2372968 the city has been in a lot worse shape than this
2372969 philosophically it could still go further because where we were in 1980 was lower than this in that there were more abandoned houses there were larger sections of neighborhoods that were abandoned
2372970 swap stop wasting abandoned properties a providence nonprofit agency would give you houses for 1 000 and give you a grant to fix them up
2372971 the wisdom in real estate is you buy low sell high
2372972 this is how i got started i bought in a time like this

2372975 the un secretary general had not uttered a word meaning that he respects our law and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us air it out in clarion call to say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2372976 why should gore and the former us vice president give judgment of evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning for the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country

2372979 washington defense secretary robert m gates will endorse a 20 billion plan to substantially increase the size of afghanistan s army and will also restructure the military command of american and nato forces in response to the growing taliban threat senior pentagon and military officials said thursday
2372980 taken together the two decisions are an acknowledgment of shortcomings that continue to hinder nato and american led operations in afghanistan with the war in iraq still an obstacle to any immediate american troop increase in afghanistan the plan was described by officials as an attempt to increase allied and afghan capabilities in advance of deploying the additional american brigades that mr gates and his commanders agree are necessary

2372982 the soviet union citing the 1978 treaty of friendship cooperation and good neighborliness that had been signed between the two countries intervened on december 24 1979 over 100 000 soviet troops took part in the invasion backed by another 100 000 plus and by members of the parcham faction amin was killed and replaced by babrak karmal the soviet occupation resulted in the killings of at least 600 000 to 2 million afghan civilians over five million afghans fled their country to pakistan iran and other parts of the world faced with mounting international pressure and great number of casualties on both sides the soviets withdrew in 1989
2372983 nato took command of the nationwide mission to stabilize afghanistan in 2006 the allies expected to face little direct combat and to focus on reconstruction and on maintaining security in areas that were relatively calm in contrast the american led mission in afghanistan has focused from the start of the war on combat operations to capture or kill insurgents and terrorists as well as on training afghan security forces counter insurgency and reconstruction
2372984 yup but it would be much cheaper to just buy the opium crop
2372985 meanwhile the taliban managed to nearly eradicate the majority of the opium production by 2001
2372986 as much as one third of afghanistans gdp comes from growing poppy and illicit drugs including opium and its two derivatives morphine and heroin as well as hashish production opium production in afghanistan has soared to a new record in 2007
2372987 it should be noted that operation enduring freedom afghanistan which is a joint us and afghan operation is separate from the isaf international security assistance force isaf which is an operation of nato nations including the usa the two operations run in parallel and although has been intended that they merge for some time this has not yet happened
2372988 i ask are we in fact at war with radical islam world wide and if so just say it
2372989 obamas popularity is not because of his race but in spite of it he is popular because of his charisma enthusiasm vision energy convictions and because of the confidence and hope that emanate from his persona
2372990 his stated policies are potentially extremely destructive and foolish such as massive tax increases and protectionism
2372991 it is our business however to go after terrorist enemies of the united states and our nato allies wherever we find them
2372992 it is this intensely emotional response to obama that is such a concern his followers love him with the zeal of cult members without bothering to discuss policy
2372993 what i am now is a citizen of a country that was attacked by people who flew commercial airplanes into buildings and i think we need to keep that in mind
2372994 but none of obamas supporters bothered to discover the facts which are readily available
2372995 is this e mail real it says no it is a bogus bunch of bird droppings
2372996 principles often take a back seat when there is a substantial economic consideration
2372997 youre using the obama campaign site as a reference for his tax policies
2372998 q would obama tax my profits if i sell my home would he tax my ira would he tax my water
2372999 i think the most reasonable take is that obama is probably doing just fine
2373000 the city watchdog the financial services authority has told the uks banks to make sure they are strong enough to

2373007 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
2373008 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
2373009 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
2373010 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
2373011 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
2373012 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
2373013 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
2373014 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
2373015 if you want your leadership to matter lead in the things that matter to god
2373016 jesus didnt come to make us feel safe he came to make us brave
2373017 now that i have it im miserably unsatisfied but i still want more of it
2373018 real results by the end of my first term in office
2373019 take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
2373020 leverage billions more in private capital to build a new energy economy
2373021 will create 40 50 less carbon emission and use half the fuel of other similar houseboats
2373022 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
2373023 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
2373024 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
2373025 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
2373026 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
2373027 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
2373028 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
2373029 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2373030 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
2373031 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
2373032 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
2373033 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
2373034 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2373035 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2373036 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2373037 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2373038 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2373039 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2373040 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2373041 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2373042 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2373043 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2373044 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2373045 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2373046 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2373047 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
2373048 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
2373049 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
2373050 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2373051 theres frustration there because theyre watching these childish ad campaigns and they know exactly how to answer it but theyre powerless to do so
2373052 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
2373053 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
2373054 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2373055 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
2373056 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
2373057 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
2373058 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
2373059 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
2373060 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
2373061 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
2373062 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2373063 i think global warming alternative energy and solar energy in particular like al gore are all overblown
2373064 but i think that global warming alternative energy and solar energy in particular like al gore are all overblown
2373065 the involvement of charities means that not only will the film inspire people to act but we can also give them a way to put this inspiration to use afterwards
2373066 we want people to realise that they have the power to resist
2373067 we hope that ngos will be able to tell their members about the project driving more people to the site when we make the film hopefully it will inspire more people to visit the site and join the resist network continuing the whole process
2373068 in most cases the support is not just financial we have worked with all sorts of films including features such as blood diamond in the past people came to us with completed projects and asked us for support but now we work in a more holistic way from script development and research onwards
2373069 if the film maker wants to tell both sides of the story they can do that
2373070 we support freedom of expression any storytelling is positive for us if it shines a light on what is happening in the world we get involved to tell our side of the story correctly documentaries can be overwhelming if they do not contain a solution to the problems they highlight ngos can give that al gores film ended with an example of what people can do people are ripe for that kind of activism
2373071 then we went to britdoc and its organisers supported us pitching for funding when people have seen what we have made we want them to feel inspired to act
2373072 we got involved with britdoc two years ago because we thought documentaries were an effective way of getting complicated issues which cant be summed up in a soundbite through to the public erasing david looks like it will be entertaining and this makes it more accessible which is perfect when trying to interest people in a debate
2373073 it is easy to see how these collaborations can work with subjects such as science if there is transparency
2373074 but i think that where for example a film maker wants to make a documentary on the international criminal court one needs to be particularly careful that both sides of the argument are properly analysed
2373075 i sense that film makers often want to make a film and they are not too concerned where they come from i am a journalist and i like to see things investigated with a critical eye when there is more than one view on a topic we need to be careful about where backing comes from
2373076 i cant think of subjective journalism that i have a problem with if it is marked as subjective and clear
2373077 most journalism is already subjective even if it is labelled as objective i am suspicious of all organisations including news organisations there always needs to be proper controls to protect editorial integrity for ngos collaboration wont work if they ask for something too specific but if say they want to fund increased reporting from congo it can work
2373078 there used to be five broadcasters paying high sums for documentaries now with for example the probability that itv will be able to reduce its public service commitments everything is different commercial and third sector brands can invest in documentaries if it is done sensibly
2373079 you need people who will email friends and walk the streets to talk about a project third sector people care enough to do that
2373080 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
2373081 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
2373082 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2373083 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
2373084 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
2373085 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
2373086 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
2373087 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
2373088 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
2373089 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
2373090 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
2373091 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
2373092 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
2373093 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
2373094 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
2373095 they can hang the panels over the screen its all about personalization
2373096 these products are great quality so something can last four years and beyond to the first apartment
2373097 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
2373098 and yet few politicians have seemed inclined to address solutions particularly if those solutions involve a modest individual sacrifice
2373099 since taking steps to make his home more environmentally friendly last june gore devours an average of 17 768 kwh per month 1 638 kwh more energy per month than the year before the renovations by comparison the average american household consumes 11 040 kwh in an entire year according to the energy information administration the cost of gores electric bills over the past year topped 16 533
2373100 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
2373101 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
2373102 the key for fannie and freddie both and also for banks is do they have the capital to get through the next year or so
2373103 so if they can hold if they are not taken under by a wave of defaults now itll be a good business two years out it looks like they can but there are a lot of negatives out there too
2373104 the housing crisis that we all observe as we drive home every single day continues to strain our results and our capital
2373105 while we expect that 2008 will be our peak year for credit related expenses the total amount of credit related expenses will be significant in 2009
2373106 none of the plans that weve advanced contemplate access to any treasury line weve not asked them and they have not offered
2373107 i dont think its by any means inevitable that they will go insolvent but after the legislation we dont know what the capital will be
2373108 we are no longer investors in fannie mae and freddie mac
2373109 por favor la imagen de mi hija no la saquen a la luz porque a ella no le gusta y a m tampoco a m h ganme lo que quiera pero no toquen a mis hijas porque yo mato me pongo bestia
2373110 soy amiga de la mam de omar mahchi desde hace tiempo y l es amigo de mis hijas y ac no hay nada m s que una amistad ella alejandra es una joven de 20 a os y no tiene ning n tipo de relaci n ni con omar ni con nadie solo tiene amigos
2373111 me parece perfecto y genial yo lo sab a y no tengo ning n problema en ese sentido
2373112 rejecting a prosecution request for a severe sentence a panel of military officers sentenced the convicted former driver for osama bin laden to five and a half years in prison on thursday the sentence means that the first detainee convicted after a war crimes trial here could complete his punishment by the end of this year
2373113 to see yourself in an advertisement while you are walking down the street is kind of breathtaking and its rewarding to know that you are being a part of something thats above yourself its something the entire country is sharing
2373114 i thought it would be fun to see if i still had the stuff
2373115 i never really took modeling seriously until i started getting work through ford chicago
2373116 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2373117 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
2373118 this is a glorious but also huge task for anyone
2373119 i should never let the dream of all the chinese people down that was why i was nervous
2373120 every time i must balance myself in the air and hold the torch as close to the cauldron gas outlet but every time the wind blew in different directions
2373121 means china is standing side by side with the rest of the world
2373122 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china
2373123 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
2373124 i could force you to download child porn or send subversive material to china
2373125 the exploitation is almost limitless google has to fix it
2373126 it turns out a lot of people who develop these things arent good at security
2373127 weve been telling google about these vulnerabilities for years and they have not made corrective actions
2373128 they chose to open the doors and insomuch put a lot of consumers at risk
2373129 oh yeah but hes not as good as al gore if only al gore had won did i tell you how much i like al gore
2373130 its no good running a pig farm badly for 30 years while saying really i was meant to be a ballet dancer by then pigs will be your style
2373131 there is a direct correlation between how people perceive the economy and the importance they place on the environment when times are tough people resent paying more to salve their conscience
2373132 when people are feeling the pinch we need to make it pay to go green instead of being fined for not recycling households should be paid for recycling

2373138 recently mr obama has been talking more about thrift than trees instead of showing off his recycling skills he explains that his children dont receive christmas or birthday presents
2373139 mr obama has been talking more about thrift than trees instead of showing off his recycling skills he explains that his children dont receive christmas or birthday presents
2373140 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention the real enemy then is humanity itself
2373141 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
2373142 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
2373143 what a stupid sign all people who do home repair are mobile they come to you what else are you supposed to do bring your home to them to repair it

2373145 our second quarter results reflect challenging conditions in the housing and mortgage markets that began in 2006 and have deepened through 2007 and 2008
2373146 fannie mae is providing stability and liquidity to the housing market in the united states and we will continue to play a key role as the market recovers from this cycle
2373147 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2373148 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices
2373149 with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly
2373150 and i think they need to work through that process of healing my sense is that thats going to be their top priority
2373151 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2373152 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2373153 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2373154 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2373155 i am proud of the courage john showed by his honesty in the face of shame
2373156 i ask that the public who expressed concern about the harm johns conduct has done to us think also about the real harm that the present voyeurism does and give me and my family the privacy we need at this time
2373157 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false
2373158 used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it
2373159 mad she was angry furious would be a good way to describe it
2373160 she should not be involved in protecting me from whatever the consequences of this are
2373161 my lord and my wife have forgiven me and so im going to move on i think our marriage will not only survive it will be strong
2373162 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2373163 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2373164 help two friends and former colleagues rebuild their lives when harassment by supermarket tabloids made it impossible for them to move forward on their own
2373165 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen
2373166 i want to see our party lead on the great moral issues yes me a democrat using that word the great moral issues that face our country
2373167 if we want to live in a moral honest just america and if we want to live in a moral and just world we cant wait for somebody else to do it we have to do it
2373168 scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy because of slowing consumer demand
2373169 there is growing talk of rba rate cuts and commodity prices are plunging said akifumi uchida deputy general manager of the marketing unit at sumitomo trust amp banking in tokyo
2373170 a selling scenario seems to be under way for the aussie he said
2373171 it is looking more likely that demand will remain subdued and economic growth will be fairly slow over the period ahead
2373172 the market is pricing in aggressive easing by the central bank said yoshisada ishide a fund manager who oversees the equivalent of us1
2373173 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
2373174 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
2373175 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
2373176 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
2373177 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
2373178 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
2373179 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
2373180 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
2373181 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
2373182 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
2373183 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
2373184 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2373185 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2373186 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2373187 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
2373188 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
2373189 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
2373190 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
2373191 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
2373192 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
2373193 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
2373194 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
2373195 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
2373196 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
2373197 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
2373198 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
2373199 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
2373200 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
2373201 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
2373202 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
2373203 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
2373204 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy

2373208 internet filtering has been on the rise in asia for the past five years says john palfrey executive director of harvard universitys berkman center for internet amp society
2373209 it matters because it highlights the tension between the desire to grow the economy with the desire to control political speech
2373210 internet filtering is an attempt to make the internet function much as traditional media have yet where the state can serve as a gatekeeper over what is said and by whom palfrey says
2373211 netizens in china are helping to highlight corruption and abuses of power the phenomenon has taken some government officials by shock and thats a good thing
2373212 depends on specifically how they are deployed by and with whom and how transparently and openly that deployment happens says rebecca mackinnon a media professor at the university of hong kong and a widely read blogger
2373213 despite the growth in internet filtering in asia the long term prospects for censorship on the web are not great palfrey says
2373214 citizens in asia among other parts of the world like the middle east have often demonstrated their ingenuity when it comes to evading censorship online
2373215 somebody was laying on my legs a lady next to me she had her arm crushed up the lady who was on my left a man was on top of her
2373216 i think im the luckiest one out of most people

2373218 we have requested law enforcement agencies to be alert for any buses being operated by angel tours or iguala busmex since they are not authorized to operate legally
2373219 if found on the road we want law enforcement to immediately stop and place the vehicles out of service
2373220 this happened like katrina like challenger what we can do is pray
2373221 god will comfort them tell people to keep trusting in god do not blame anybody do not ask why now we just help each other to get through this
2373222 the church is like one big family here were very close we stick together
2373223 we are here with them to pray for those who are lost and for gods consolation in this time of grief and loss
2373224 the vietnamese catholic culture is very strong a lot of those who have come here have been through a great deal just to get to this country theyve always preserved their catholic faith this is a trial this is a challenge
2373225 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
2373226 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
2373227 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
2373228 some members of the council need more time this negotiation has not come to a halt tonight and will be resumed tomorrow saturday
2373229 the expectation around the world is for a ceasefire for an end to use of russian aerial bombing missile attacks use of combat forces us ambassador zalmay khalilzad told reporters
2373230 show restraint and to refrain from any further acts of violence or force
2373231 with the connivance of a number of security council members
2373232 we will not allow to go unpunished the deaths of our compatriots
2373233 historically russia was and will remain the guarantor of the security of the people of the caucasus
2373234 humanitarian assistance cannot be used as a pretext for the presence of non georgian troops
2373235 the parties to show the utmost restraint and refrain from actions that would further inflame the situation
2373236 with cloud computer looming on the horizon it is important for us all to think of the privacy threats there as well
2373237 the tool resides with someone else and the data is stored somewhere else generally that is a bad idea
2373238 when information is in the public domain it is game over
2373239 information on your computer may get protection under the law but on someone elses it gets less protection
2373240 the information we are all giving to online companies is massive and dangerous and its going to get worse before it gets better
2373241 giving them our data is a clear and present risk
2373242 how hard would it be to target someone as a political activist or a person with aids
2373243 this is heresy but one day google will die what happens to data when a company dies is a big question
2373244 the divisions agreement in principle with ubs if approved by the commission will quickly restore liquidity to tens of thousands of ubs investors
2373245 todays solution provides further relief beginning in september to investors who have been understandably frustrated by the industry wide failure of the ars market
2373246 our clients have been caught in an unprecedented liquidity crisis
2373247 the driver saw that the bridge was moving and was starting to fall
2373248 he immediately slammed on the emergency brakes and hid in the engine compartment of the locomotive
2373249 six seconds later there was the shock and it was still going at 120 kilometres an hour
2373250 i heard a terrible noise i immediately left my office to see what had happened the image before me will never leave me until the day i die
2373251 it is not easy to speak when you have a catastrophe of such proportions before your eyes
2373252 the czech government will examine this catastrophe on august 20
2373253 if there had been the slightest suspicion of complications for example cranial head trauma then they would certainly have been kept in
2373254 our carriage was full of young people and we were having fun then there was the crash chaos people were dying they had no legs and arms i am alive i have been born again
2373255 save someones life and you have a burden for life
2373256 it is extremely improbable that we will have the structure and financial ability to take on all the people who require art antiretroviral therapy and then treat them for life
2373257 if you add the current 35 billion that is being spent in the developed world youre talking at that time about annually needing almost 90 billion dollars in a continuous fashion
2373258 and that doesnt even take into account complications with secondary resistance to drugs and other issues
2373259 a kind of curious passivity among the international aids establishment
2373260 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
2373261 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
2373262 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
2373263 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
2373264 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
2373265 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
2373266 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
2373267 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
2373268 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
2373269 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
2373270 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
2373271 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
2373272 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
2373273 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
2373274 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
2373275 a single parent living in riverside county or orange county needs to earn 24 74 an hour to make ends meet but after 10 months of negotiation 11 50 an hour is the last best offer the 10 campus university of california has made to 8 500 gardeners janitors kitchen workers parking attendants and the like in response their union the american federation of state county and municipal employees local 3299 called a five day strike which began monday
2373276 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
2373277 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
2373278 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2373279 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
2373280 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
2373281 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
2373282 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
2373283 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
2373284 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
2373285 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
2373286 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
2373287 well ok then but you make sure you go potty before we leave
2373288 thats it go on and make fun of your mothers mental health its no wonder im loosing it i keep hearing some small child calling me grandma
2373289 if those little girls slept with as many men as they say in the tabloids why their little butts would have more fingerprints than the fbi
2373290 now we have to review to ensure sensitivity and clarity
2373291 not only is the patient receiving had news but insensitivity on top of that this is something that requires the human touch
2373292 in the rest of the country insurance companies are making these decisions and are not paying for suicide
2373293 involuntary choices are foisted on people all the time by virtue of denials
2373294 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
2373295 train as if you were in a war and when the time comes and you face hell it will seem like a day out on a park pond fail to train and you will face the very real risk of never being seen again

2373326 given the record high price of home heating fuel far too many new yorkers will have to choose between heating their homes throughout the long months of ice and snow and bitter cold that are coming and feeding their families we cannot wait until the crisis is upon us before we act
2373327 at a time when our economy is in a decline and new york is facing serious economic challenges shell and exxon mobil recorded a 2008 second quarter profit of nearly 12 billion each and chevron and every other big oil company enjoyed another quarter of record profits
2373328 many new yorkers are expected to struggle this winter with the high cost of home heating oil
2373329 the assembly majority has developed and passed a plan to provide an additional 550 million to enhance the home energy assistance program heap and 250 million for energy conservation measures and home energy efficient programs our plan will help more families to qualify for much needed assistance we dont want anyone in our state to have to choose between heating and eating
2373330 while we believe this id s workable plan that demands big oil to help solve the crisis they created we remain open to all ideas for funding
2373331 the point is we cannot let new yorkers freeze this winter

2373337 there is decent evidence the race is tightening not just here but nationally

2373441 in the past decade we have made historic strides in crime reduction in this state
2373442 we cannot lose ground and we must never become complacent where public safety is concerned vigilance and consistent focus pressure and smart strategies are necessary to achieving long term results in crime reduction

2373457 i would naturally i would probably stand on my basically my reputation and say it came from the vice president
2373458 but there wasnt anything in the writing that you remember saying the vice president
2373459 you know if youve ever seen the vice presidents stationery its on the white house letterhead it may have said ovp office of the vice president i dont remember that so i dont want to mislead you
2373460 this posting is contrary to my practice across 25 years as a journalist but the issues in this matter are simply too important to stand as discredited in any way
2373461 i would say right it came to us george had a raised eyebrow and basically we passed it on it was to and passed this on into the organization
2373462 they are not involved in any way in this conflict between the russian military and the georgian military
2373463 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2373464 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2373465 georgian military forces completely control all the territory of south ossetia
2373466 they have sent in their troops and weapons and they are bombing our towns
2373467 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located

2373482 there are two kinds of letter the first is precise but lacks soul in this case although the calligrapher may have mastered the technique he has focused solely on the craft which is why it hasnt evolved but become repetitive he hasnt grown at all and one day hell give up the practice of writing because he feels it is mere routine the second kind is done with great technique but with soul as well for that to happen the intention of the writer must be in harmony with the word
2373483 many projects have taken place in wards without the consultation and participation of ward members and without accountability to the local communities through the ward structures
2373484 how will the existing structures which bring transparency and accountability be utilised in any planning for this programme
2373485 the way its being spent should be discussed in public it should all be transparent
2373486 he is somebody who doesnt want dialogue he wants to close down dialogue
2373487 some officers dont seem to realise that their job is to act in accordance with what councillors want not the other way around
2373488 the real issue here is that councillors are the elected representatives of the people and we have the contacts and the knowledge

2373515 i believe in compulsory cannibalism if people were forced to eat what they killed there would be no more wars
2373516 today when more children are overweight compared with previous generations it can be harder for parents to objectively identify if their child is overweight
2373517 research shows that most parents of overweight or obese children think that their child is a healthy weight some research showed that only 10 of parents with overweight or obese children described their child as overweight
2373518 preliminary findings of the survey suggest that many people who would be defined clinically as obese find the use of the term obese highly offensive and would stop listening to further advice
2373519 to shrink from using the word obesity is really ducking an issue
2373520 it does not have to be used in a judgmental or insulting way if a child is obese then the parents should know that its obese we must make parents know that the lifestyle of the family needs to be modified
2373521 risks and benefits of bmi reporting in the school setting
2373522 our feeling is that the information should be given to parents if there is a serious health concern much like any other health concern a child might have
2373523 this information should not be included on a report card or such medical information should be kept separate
2373524 the government must lead on action across society to tackle obesity engaging parents in this issue is essential to achieving success in instigating behavioral change
2373525 wed like to stomp out driving while impaired all together but in order to do that youve got to educate people and youve got to get voluntary compliance from the motoring public and thats what were attempting to do
2373526 a lot of people if they hear the campaign theyll pay attention and it will make everyone aware that were not going to tolerate it
2373527 the people that dont pay attention to the campaign then were going to take care of them too
2373528 if youve been drinking and you think youve had anything close get your buddy to take you home or catch a ride
2373529 canadians simply wont tolerate these lunatics what these people were going to do was hurtful harmful and disruptive to the peace order and good government that we guarantee to our citizens so they have no place in this country

2373533 the judge ruled in our favor and the city must remove the initiative from the november ballot
2373534 the city of big bear lake is unable to comment on the ruling because it is an issue between two private parties
2373535 we were aware of the ordinance but it hadnt yet been filed with the registrar of voters for the november election we were expecting it pending this court case
2373536 there are two common criticisms of a government funded classical music station one that it is elitist because it appeals only to the educated or privileged and two that it is irrelevant in the modern world because it can appeal only to the old my readers and the complainants to the cbcs own website prove both these conjectures wrong my correspondents included a fair number of university professors and trained classical musicians yes as does the listenership of the cbc but they were far outnumbered by the people who work in car dealerships or in boring offices and who love serious music just as much as any bespectacled torontonian
2373537 those who were the most passionate in their lamentations for this lifeline to challenging culture were those who lived in small towns or in the country over and over they reminded me that without public radio and in the absence of any regular music appreciation classes in the public school system there was nowhere absolutely nowhere for them to ever hear symphonic opera choral or chamber music or any discussions thereof
2373538 we are now on schedule for a dramatic dismantling of the last public national resource for access to a musical education particularly for those in small towns and for those without privileged access to an educated milieu once this point of entry to an educated world is gone that world will wither
2373539 we are anticipating the arrival of a larger first year class substantially larger than we had anticipated
2373540 and second what were seeing is a situation in where returning students more returning students want to live on campus
2373541 were going to have to provide police and security and well do that as frequently as we have to to make sure that students are able to get back and forth from wherever it is that theyre living to the campus
2373542 we wanted to put new insulated windows in the apartments
2373543 we wanted to bring air conditioning into the building as a result we had to bring in new underground steam and chilled water lines
2373544 of course we wanted to bring in an elevator too
2373545 it just seemed to make sense to me that first year students live on campus given that they tend to be the youngest students
2373546 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2373547 i recognized my mistake and told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness
2373548 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2373549 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2373550 take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby
2373551 if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
2373552 i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help

2373555 we were tired of seeing the candidates tip toe around the issues and merely pay lip service so we created this questionnaire posing specific policy questions for the candidates to answer
2373556 the first phone call i placed was answered cordially i was told that someone would get back to me i never heard back from anyone
2373557 the second time i called the person i was speaking with hung up and the third time i called the line was disconnected
2373558 it is clear to me that the mccain campaign is not interested in speaking to the issues
2373559 we believe that they owe it not only to us to respond to the questionnaire but to their base
2373560 if they dont respond at that point we can only surmise that they do not take the latino community seriously and are truly delivering nothing more than political pandering to get the latino vote
2373561 john edwards has admitted that he had an extramarital affair with a former videographer in his presidential campaign and repeatedly lied about it in an interview airing tonight on abcs nightline the former north carolina senator and democratic presidential contender acknowledged the affair which came during a campaign in which he stressed the importance of family and in which his wife elizabeth who suffers from an incurable form of cancer played a prominent role

2373573 the first attempt to circulate a beam in the large hadron collider lhc will be made on september 10
2373574 we are headed for massive shortages of food and other essentials mainly brought about by the depletion of geological fossil reserves of cheap energy and water
2373575 suppose that half of the land on every one acre or smaller urban suburban home lot in the entire nation were devoted to food growing
2373576 o nce the collapse sets in the dense interdependence of our globalised world will be subject to strains then shattering right across the system against which no modern state will be able to insulate itself even if the impacts are differential the whole orientation of political relations and structures of production and distribution will be violently torn apart ending in all probability as the usual end result of the collapse of complex societies in much smaller political entities with substantially simplified information and production systems and consumption patterns
2373577 the return to locally organised life will not be temporary but rather a return to life somewhat as it was many generations ago or even in the middle ages

2373593 since you are such an evil son of a bitch you get a choice of what you want to do down here but whomever you relieve gets a second chance at life
2373594 im not good at this either so what else do you have
2373595 in the fundamentalist things in the jihad that sounds like a country western term like jihad but in the jihad if you kill an infidel which im sad to say is all of us and you yourself die you go to heaven and there youre greeted by 71 dark haired virgins and anyone whos ever been with one virgin is going i dont know but recently theres an article in the new york times that says koran scholars said the actual translation is that it is not 71 dark haired virgins but 71 crystal clear raisins slight difference in interpretation really thats really strange its like finding out thou shalt not kill is really thou shalt not wear a kilt and the scottish are going fuck off
2373596 you were amazed to discover that cell phones have uses other than setting off roadside bombs

2373599 the fee engine becomes so huge that these products take on a life of their own
2373600 everyone rationalizes that its safe because theyre making so much money but its far from safe
2373601 the subprime crisis and its fallout on commodity and foreign exchange markets significantly raises the odds of a recession early next year
2373602 whenever the market turns against you you take the biggest losses in illiquid securities
2373603 because there are so few buyers youre forced to sell at a discount that is both huge and highly unpredictable
2373604 the risk to investors is far greater because were getting so little information
2373605 this will take two to three years to play out
2373606 is taking a pool of risky illiquid bonds and through the magic of securitization offering higher yields than on similarly rated securities
2373607 management should have learned from the ltcm and asian crises that when liquidity runs dry it happens in a day
2373608 what we had was a perpetual motion machine driving mortgage prices to uneconomic levels of risk vs reward
2373609 the hedge funds and other customers were demanding higher yields so merrill couldnt sell that supposedly safe aaa rated paper
2373610 merrill took the top tranches onto its own balance sheet
2373611 they must have had their eyes on the fees and not the risk
2373612 we believe the number of murdered women is much higher as cases go unreported by their families who fear reprisal from extremists

2373639 his life was all about him blah blah blah he was a rebel i dont need to know anything else i dont need to know the minutia everything you need to know is right there
2373640 the question to my mind is whether or not we ought to get them the heck out of that country because thats some crazy stuff when youve got your officials talking like they are in a back alley brawl and not government officials who took an oath to obey the law and so forth

2373651 i went to the vermont department of motor vehicles yesterday to update my drivers license i was told that my name and social security number do not match up in the computer and i have 90 days to correct the situation or my license can be revoked someone has stolen my name what besides my house my car and my bank account do they want
2373652 i think someone may have paid someone at social security to change the spelling of my name in order to deprive me of my medical records to exposure to federally regulated toxic hazardous substances at work im just trying to figure out who would want me to stop using my name cris ericson i have a little house an old car and a tiny bank account i think the real motive for someone allegedly paying someone at social security to change my name is that the attorneys for the employers bankruptcy action dont want me to ever get official whistle blower status for prying open their nasty trade secret chemicals which include a carcinogen i will do my best to get my name back to get my identity back i have called the f b i i will file whatever injunctive relief court actions i have to file
2373653 you can point the gum down and hurt your foot
2373654 you can point the gum up and then the things come down like rain and land on you
2373655 richard told me that the gum makes a person day o duh de
2373656 if you use a gum on a robber then in three days he will be dead but on humans they will be alive four days and then they will die and then we hope they had a good life
2373657 mama i want to know about the powerful things what are the other powerful things
2373658 oh my god why is so obsessed with these morbid things
2373659 this is so gross cant we do something else now
2373660 its a normal phase that he will grow out of my job is to accompany him through this and to point him in the direction of goodness
2373661 how come dave and harold our neighbors dont have any kids
2373662 because some mens want to have mamas and some mens dont and sometimes it is two girls in the family
2373663 if things are quiet and undisturbed in your church that is not necessarily a good sign things are usually pretty quiet around the sick and the dead and especially in graveyards
2373664 it has been placed there in memory of the young men who died in the service
2373665 which service did they die in the morning service or the evening
2373666 the surprising thing is not that so few people come to church the surprising thing is that anybody comes at all
2373667 okay go and get it its hanging up with your coat and sweaters
2373668 honey you dont have to be naked to wear your smock
2373669 it is critical that all new yorkers do their part to protect the states water resources
2373670 while recognizing that the presence of pharmaceuticals in the water is a multi faceted issue with no single solution or easy technological fix all of us need to take precautionary action on the things we can affect immediately
2373671 this is an emerging environmental issue and the consequences are not yet clear
2373672 new yorkers can help out by not flushing unused drugs and instead using alternate disposal methods we recognize that were now asking residents to change something that has been standard practice for years but we know everyone wants to protect new yorks water quality and public health
2373673 new yorks public drinking water is of high quality but keeping unused drugs out of our waters helps to maintain or improve that quality
2373674 hospitals and other institutions can also help with these efforts
2373675 the state education department recognizes this emerging environmental problem and is working with the dec to address the proper disposal of drugs
2373676 the education department with the advice of its board of pharmacy and the pharmaceutical community that it regulates will continue to study why so many dispensed drugs go unused and to determine appropriate strategies to insure that new yorkers and their environment are protected
2373677 in a chat room you have the feeling that you can say whatever you want
2373678 i was talking with some people in a chat room
2373679 when a man asked me if i knew any 14 year olds he wanted to have sex with them he said that he was willing to give them money for sex
2373680 gradually seduce their targets through the use of attention affection kindness and even gifts
2373681 they listen to and empathize with the problems of children they will be aware of the latest music hobbies and interests of children these individuals attempt to lower childrens inhibitions gradually by slowly introducing sexual context and content into their conversations
2373682 i thought i had enough self control to terminate a chat session if the subject turned to sex but time and again i found myself hanging on and chatting about sexual subjects i felt bad later
2373683 all of a sudden he is going after her like a bull that comes even to the slaughter
2373684 when an immoral picture popped up on my screen the person i was chatting with had sent it to my computer
2373685 keep your way far off from alongside her and do not get near to the entrance of her house that you may not give to others your dignity that strangers may not satisfy themselves with your power
2373686 all of a sudden he is going after her like a bull that comes even to the slaughter just as a bird hastens into the trap
2373687 when an immoral picture popped up on my screen the person i was chatting with had sent it to my computer
2373688 keep your way far off from alongside her and do not get near to the entrance of her house that you may not give to others your dignity that strangers may not satisfy themselves with your power
2373689 i would start conversations with people and then take on a personality to fit the conversation
2373690 and with those who hide what they are i do not come in
2373691 by eliminating the differences existing between the member states legislation the directive has had a positive effect on the free movement of database related goods or services within the community

2373695 no matter how successful the google book project becomes no matter how many libraries co operate and no matter how many billions of pages are ultimately archived online physical libraries full of paper books will become more important than ever
2373696 librarians will have to locate and provide information about local resources for food medicine travel and shelter they will be required to identify local talent and experts and list plants native to the area they will carry information about the environmental needs of the region its transportation and the source of the communitys water and whether it is healthy libraries will have to maintain current travel information walking bus car golf cart etc and knowledge about local land use librarians will also identify and address barriers to information access they will facilitate local access to people developing alternative means of transportation energy and more they will keep track of available housing and whether there is enough of it armed with data about the resources that make communities function librarians can begin to develop an information communication and referral system that addresses the unique needs and assets of their region
2373697 m ost of what today is considered to be information will disappear for three reasons firstly much information today is only available electronically and with the failure of electrical systems this will disappear through the illegibility of electronic memories secondly most of what is deemed to be useful today by way of knowledge and information will lose its relevance and so be abandoned and finally making a living through developing and processing knowledge will become a luxury in so far as most human time will return to manual work in fields and workshops one can imagine if there is some planning for an energy and knowledge parsimonious future that some centres universities or whatever will survive and these will rescue and store information and go on to recover or re learn knowledge relevant to the emergent circumstances

2373705 russia is fighting a war with us in our own territory
2373706 the number of refugees is climbing the panic is growing people are trying to save their lives
2373707 now that there is talk that georgia and ukraine might join nato at some point i think russia which has significantly reasserted itself on the world stage has said point blank that this will not happen
2373708 russias voice has been ignored many times by the west on nato expansion on kosovo on iraq and i think this time russia is determined because this is on the russian border and russia assumes that this is a territory where russia has very serious interests
2373709 people are there without water food electricity they cant leave their shelters
2373710 however is that the result of the renewable fuels standard mandate our conclusion is no
2373711 and second are those price increases meeting the statutory requirement of severe harm to the economy and our conclusion is no
2373712 instead the misguided corn ethanol mandate is forcing farmers to plow up marginal land and wildlife habitat while increasing global warming and dumping toxic fertilizers and pesticides into our precious water sources
2373713 i am disappointed that the epa missed this opportunity to provide relief for american consumers who are dealing with skyrocketing food prices due to the unintended consequences of the continued escalation of the ethanol mandate
2373714 continue to plan for and meet the fuel and food needs of the future
2373715 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to
2373716 this song is not only outrageously offensive to sen clinton rev jackson sen mccain and president bush it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics

2373719 im working all the way until the beginning of the fall semester i wont get a vacation until labor day weekend
2373720 i just graduated with a degree in geology so the accreditation association for ambulatory health care institute for quality improvement recently announced that arizona state universitys campus health service has been awarded an honorable thirteen writing prompts
2373721 i think shiny tight and short is the quickest way to look hoh blogs and pictures
2373722 you like it when i use your name i know you do go ahead and show it master id like to see
2373723 what is it that you want doctor and dont tell me its to rule the universe with me or to escape the time lords punishment youve already turned down the former as for the latter well lets just say that im a bit leery of your claims to hate bondage your recent double bluff of the axons hinged on an ultimately false professed desire to shake off the high councils yoke after all
2373724 its very simple master im surprised you havent guessed really
2373725 yeah well not a big surprise that i suppose some of the things i did in this time line could have left you with the opposite impression
2373726 i want your mind you body i want to be in you
2373727 go ahead see for yourself im telling you the truth i want you believe it
2373728 i believe youre lonely and that you want your loneliness to stop if only for a little while
2373729 strangely enough doctor right now i find that i dont especially care whether it is or isnt
2373730 then perhaps we should go now before your state attracts attention
2373731 if anyone notices ill just tell them that you did it you are evil after all some things never change
2373732 doctor this is 1971 its just possible that holding hands with another man in public can still get you arrested here even if it isnt
2373733 im sure its the kind of thing these humans all around us would find objectionable
2373734 well well just explain that were two dear old friends who are sharing an umbrella because i was incredibly forgetful and didnt bring mine with me today
2373735 why not itll save us a night in jail or a mugging well hopefully
2373736 we were friends once more than friends we should be able to remember that sometimes
2373737 this is lovely come over here and try it master
2373738 perhaps now youd tell me what this is all about
2373739 i believe that you want company yes but i still cant figure out why you claim to want my company
2373740 that you say you do doesnt abate my skepticism doctor
2373741 i want you because youre the one i want to be with youre the only one
2373742 i cant explain why i want you any better than that
2373743 since that circuitous logic explains absolutely nothing perhaps you could tell me why you think im the only one you can be with this way surely you could find a human companion who would be willing to indulge your hitherto infrequent sexual urges this body youre wearing now is quite pleasing to the eye if a bit on the thin side i imagine you could attract any number of adequate bed partners
2373744 i imagine i could too but this isnt about adequate bed partners its not about just sex and it isnt the same with humans you know that from your little dalliance with queen galliea im sure and then theres your wife
2373745 you marry a human in the future i think it was a church wedding and everything
2373746 cant think why she was pretty enough i suppose but she hardly had a towering intellect must have made for some very boring evenings once the fucking was finished id always credited you with being a bit more discerning but there you are in the future with a human wife you marry a human
2373747 is that jealously i hear in your voice doctor i suppose i should be touched that you come to care what i do in future but we were talking about you if you dont find humans sufficiently satisfying why not a member of some other species the forest of cheem are a delightful and refreshingly intelligent people why not seek out one of them for sexual relations or perhaps even another time lord you should be able to find a least one time lord stodgy and frigid though they may be to couple with perhaps another renegade surely there must be someone somewhere whos willing to have sex with you
2373748 i dont want to have sex with someone i want to make love with you
2373749 oh so its tenderness youre after ive always found that knowledge gained through experience is the truest knowledge since you left gallifrey in search of new experiences you can probably understand what i mean i know you maybe youre different now with other partners but i know that when it came from me you preferred rough sex to gentle lovemaking ninety nine times out of every hundred excuse me then for saying so if it offends you but the thought of you wanting tenderness from me is rather amusing
2373750 i know you too master ive known you for longer than youve known me and i think that maybe just maybe tenderness is something you wish id have always let you give
2373751 the time lines are starting to fray cant you feel it
2373752 you always were more sensitive to fluctuations in the time lines than anyone else
2373753 im not sure it started when i was a child at our induction in fact i looked into the vortex and it chose me
2373754 my dear doctor are you experiencing auditory hallucinations in your old age the master looks down at the doctor with amusement but also concern
2373755 no im talking about that tapping youre doing is that something youre hearing right now
2373756 as a matter of fact it is you should be able to hear it too if you listen its the sound of your hearts beating they used to beat the same way after wed well in any event they apparently still beat that way afterwards
2373757 i used to think when we were together that i was the only one in all of creation who could make your hearts beat with that particular rhythm
2373758 the foolish things we tell ourselves when were young and in
2373759 yeah he says by way of agreement then gathers this master to him with both arms and holds on to him tightly for a little while before he leaves
2373760 the concept had been on the table for some years now all countries have finally agreed on the formation and implementation of the saarc food bank
2373761 properly realised it would serve as a milestone in strengthening the existing cooperation among the nations of south asia
2373762 this involves the construction of new food warehouses in member countries local procurement and the international purchase of extra food grains and developing an administrative system and a distribution network so it is likely that it will take some time before operationalising the saarc food bank
2373763 americas problems the reason for every major problem facing america is in the bible sin the root cause of every major problem facing america is our sin americas solutions the solution to every major problem facing america is in the bible constitutional republic the united states is a constitutional republic not a democracy democracies are based on mans will specifically the will of the majority completely aside from moral considerations by contrast our constitutional republic is based on judeo christian principles and constitutional checks and balances between the three branches of government executive legislative and judicial

2373781 i actually walked the country to see who i am who i really am but i dont know what the result of that will be
2373782 but for me personally id rather be successful or unsuccessful based on who i really am not based on some plastic ken doll that you put up in front of audiences thats not me you know
2373783 this is what the 21st century will be about a great unraveling of some things long taken for granted
2373784 in such a time what was once heresy becomes common wisdom and the unthinkable becomes the new normal case in point the emerging mainstream consensus in the mass media that suburbia has no future the american dream is collapsing into a nightmare
2373785 changing demographics as well as a major shift in the way an increasing number of americans especially younger generations want to live and work
2373786 every day it becomes clearer and clearer that the suburban model so beloved by americans and canadians doesnt work in fact the need for change has reached a critical moment a point of no return

2373796 what he made of his former republican colleagues in the house protesting the congressional recess and making speeches to an empty room about the need for offshore drilling
2373797 my reaction to that is the same as my reaction to president bushs repeal of the 1991 executive order that his father signed that made it even more difficult than pre existing legislation to engage in offshore drilling i commend the president where has he been for seven and a half years i commend the house republicans for finally standing up and doing something but where have they been for the last seven and a half years are they serious about this or has this been an action taken to gain some headlines in advance of the democratic and republican conventions the timing is to be honest a little suspect but all of that being said its good that theyre finally doing something but to do something that will improve their standing in the polls before the election i expect that will take more than standing on the house floor making speeches with the power turned off it would take a lot more than that to create an agenda that will win them votes
2373798 barr was actually there for the first two years of the period hes talking about of course but i got his point

2373819 in the stadium kamarampaka the interahamwe took me there directly and there were many white soldiers all over i was put in a room of the tent just near by and the next thing a huge white soldier entered and closed the tent closure and undressed
2373820 i was very small he just lifted me like a baby ripped off my cloths and he started raping me
2373821 the pain was terrible i screamed till i lost my breath i was bleeding profusely then he changed and penetrated me through my mouth

2373910 its people like yourselves that understand the threat that need to come into the government and help us address this problem

2373919 my sense is that the u s went through an awful few months and were just entering those few months now
2373920 canada has been considered a bastion of economic stability unlike the u s the u k europe japan which are already in recession or heading that way
2373921 canada until recently has held up quite well but this jobs report is a sign that its our turn now
2373922 the u s dollar has already weakened and now the other countries are catching up

2373965 this proposed rule is nothing but a solution in search of a problem
2373966 the changes would invite excessive and abusive lawsuits against public companies and hurt u s global competitiveness
2373967 the proposal would encourage the same abusive litigation that is threatening the integrity and efficiency of our legal system the litigious nature of the u s markets have put us at a competitive disadvantage vis vis other markets

2374023 its a sentiment that flies in the face of history hindu majority india and muslim pakistan were born in the bloody partition of the subcontinent at independence from britain in 1947

2374038 the greatest surprise of all even for me after eight years spent working as a film critic has been the sustained level of intensely sadistic brutality throughout the film
2374039 the dark knight is a superhero movie and the violence it contains exists within that context
2374040 watching screen violence had changed the frontal lobe brain function of normal adolescents to be more like that of the children with disruptive brain disorders

2374056 more investigative minded readers may find it interesting to read the entire biblical chapter quoted here first timothy 2 goes on to ask that the woman learn in silence with all subjection and not to teach nor to usurp authority over the man but to be in silence one presumes these verses do not reflect the position of the conservative party on the role of women in canadian society

2374085 oh i cant let you have this think of what you could do with it
2374086 doctor you cant just tell them what technology they can and cant have
2374087 oh they wont need this anyway they owe me after a couple centuries of trying to capture me or kill me or whatever
2374088 it may be one two or many but they make you happy
2374089 che mi hanno lasciato messaggi e un ringraziamento speciale a tutte le persone che mi hanno lasciato il messaggio tutti i giorni
2374090 i thought that you were beyond the anti all things gallifreyan this time around
2374091 maybe im still not sure that ive forgiven you for that act of master restitution of yours
2374092 you gave him to the daleks to execute he deserved better
2374093 besides for a rebel and a rogue youre a remarkably forgiving man you really do believe that everyone can be better than they are dont you
2374094 yes well usually anyway there have been a few times ive learned my lesson but all in all its a good policy
2374095 even when everythings changing youll be one of the few that stays ahead of the tidal wave even if
2374096 i didnt realize you were given to visions of the future
2374097 but traveling with you changes people doctor you do make people better you make us into what we could be instead of what we are i didnt believe that when the high council sent me to you but over time i learned and i changed you made me better and made me see that time lords have a responsibility to the rest of the cosmos sometimes we cant just sit here and watch sometimes we have to care
2374098 change doesnt happen overnight after a few centuries of opening our eyes who knows where well be maybe well be better for it i have to try
2374099 youve always been an outsider thats your strength youre an example believe it or not of what we can do to help people we need that here on gallifrey
2374100 besides youd never have the patience to attempt change from the inside thats my job
2374101 of course i do have you ever known me not to i do so like challenges doctor remember
2374102 ive burned enough bridges over the last millennia but i suppose i suppose that i thought i might rebuild a few new ish doctor you know im more forgiving this time besides i figured that with you as president i might not be lynched upon arrival
2374103 probably not even without me doctor watching has become a bit of a spectator sport here you know
2374104 oddly enough that makes some of them envious the person we see as a rebel is the same man the rest of the universe sees as a hero thats a bit humbling even for time lords
2374105 is there really anything in the universe that can humble us ive yet to find it

2374114 i have deliberately and consciously written respectfully about islam and mohammed i envisioned that my book would be a bridge builder
2374115 cautionary advice not only that the publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
2374116 in this instance we decided after much deliberation to postpone publication for the safety of the author employees of random house booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the novel
2374117 by the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more than we achieve alone
2374118 i dont make it to church every week so its just kind of my way of keeping in touch with my faith
2374119 we all have our traditions but the bottom line is were christians i see the rosary not as something to in any way replace our sunday worship together but rather as a way to bring prayer into other areas of our lives where we may typically not pray such as while driving or exercising
2374120 its not like preaching to you or anything like that i dont think anybody would feel uncomfortable if they werent catholic listening to it
2374121 the mix with contemporary music is rather unique and i think its an attraction to the style of prayer for a number of people
2374122 weve used them in the church during reconciliation services for children the response has been good
2374123 the denial of my visa is part of a systemic effort by the chinese government to coerce and threaten athletes who are speaking out on behalf of the innocent people of darfur

2374130 you stand there eight years old staring at the raw power of time and space just a child some would be inspired some would run away and some would go mad i dont know
2374131 democratic gov ed rendell recently accepted a 12 8 billion bid to lease the pennsylvania turnpike in what would be the biggest toll road privatization deal in u s history
2374132 florida has undertaken over 150 outsourcing initiatives since 2005 leaders of all political stripes recognize privatization is a proven policy tool that can help save money and balance budgets
2374133 theres an old saying that if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck then its probably a duck
2374134 and i think we know a duck when we see one
2374135 despite some reports to the contrary we fully support our earlier position in a letter that the secretary of states office needs to tell new mexico youth organization nmyo to immediately comply with the law
2374136 due to the spread of misinformation there seems to be some thought that my office had disavowed our letter or told the secretary of state to ignore our advice that is just not true
2374137 if the deputy secretary of state thought we had instructed him to simply ignore our letter then that was a misunderstanding on his part of what was said
2374138 in the letter the center for civic policy set forth a number of claims supporting nmyos actions and urged the secretary of state not to grant the attorney generals request before they made a decision to disregard or follow the ags advice the sos was asked to let the ags office closely examine the ccps claims and report back that is where the issue stands today
2374139 we wanted to see what the center for civic policy was saying too why they were saying our advice was incorrect or flawed
2374140 the group claims that the mailers it sent out were not campaign materials
2374141 disappointed in the directive that attorney general kings office has released and we strongly disagree with their conclusions reached
2374142 the fairways are narrow and unfortunately if you miss by a foot you are worse off than if you miss by 20 yards which you need to take different peoples opinions as to whether that is fair
2374143 it is a difficult course anyway with the green and the pin positions to protect it i am not sure you need rough as long as it is and you certainly dont need to sweep it back towards the tee the night before the tournament when we have played it as it is in the practice rounds
2374144 i cant think of a reason they would do it other than to irritate the players as that is all it does
2374145 especially when you play practice rounds as it is it is 5 inches long why brush it back to us it makes no sense to me people want to see birdies and they have not seen me make any
2374146 i sound as if i am moaning which i am but it is a great shame as it is a fantastic golf course they are great greens and they are playable but there is no need to play it as it is
2374147 at this point ive been approached and asked to consider it and im considering it
2374148 its too early to be commenting on the 2010 race right now what im focused on is how are we going to help new mexico survive this republican economy what are we going to do in the special session to help new mexico families
2374149 its the next logial step for me and im very eager to run for governor
2374150 im not thinking about any other office im certainly in the game and planning on taking that next step
2374151 im not going to comment on michael sanchez or anybody i just think its too early for that
2374152 i wouldnt be considering it unless i thought i could do a good job
2374153 id give the edge as of today to diane denish because shes better known
2374154 but any viable hispanic candidate will do well here just because of the nature of our demographics
2374155 if hes gonna be a viable candidate in the primary hes gonna have to raise money early and get his name out early to compete
2374156 i think people in the fashion industry take themselves so seriously and i wanted to make fun of that

2374171 devices like the iphone even in its 3g incarnation are undoubtedly contributing to consumer awareness and usage of mobile music services people who are 15 to 20 today will anticipate to purchase directly with their phones and will drive this market over the next few years

2374175 other than search what has google done right they have 1 001 products in beta but whats been successful
2374176 there has been a sequence of missteps and failures and this is not the end they miscalculated the valuation of aol and this is the first time theyre admitting to it
2374177 for youtube from a user and consumption perspective it continues to gain market share and thats been a critical goal
2374178 there is still a risk and challenge in monetizing youtube and well have to see how it pans out but its still too early to tell
2374179 we cant dabble in the business policies or the personnel policies of an airline
2374180 what we found was that because they carried less fuel on the airplane they were getting into situations where they had to tell air traffic control i need to get on the ground
2374181 the additional cost of carrying unnecessary fuel adversely affects americans financial success
2374182 we didnt see any proposed changes we thought needed to be made
2374183 to either not stop for fuel when needed or to carry insufficient amounts of fuel
2374184 adding fuel indiscriminately reduces profit sharing and possibly pension funding
2374185 its a safety of flight issue and it needs to be treated as such
2374186 if dispatchers and pilots are saying the airlines are pressuring them and its having a chilling effect on the decisions they make every day in regard to the fuel loads and it looks its like eroding the authority of the pilot in command then that issue needs the attention of the government regulators who are there to oversee the system

2374200 we are seeking to add an important dimension to the treatment of diabetes through our proprietary flagship product this orally ingestible insulin capsule our team of scientists has worked over 25 years on developing this capsule and we are quite pleased with our progress and our accomplishments to date the fact that we attained a statistically significant response from 66 percent of the patients in this study met our expectations and we consider it a major accomplishment and a testament to the efficacy of the capsules formulation
2374201 looking ahead we anticipate partnering with cros in order to conduct additional phase 2 clinical trials on larger numbers of patients we also expect to initiate those trials by the first quarter of 2009 we believe that we currently have sufficient funding to conduct phase 2b clinical trials additionally we are preparing to file an investigational new drug application ind with the fda approximately 12 months from now
2374202 the successful completion of phase 2a trials on our oral insulin capsule is a major accomplishment for oramed the success of this trial will allow us to continue pushing forward at a steady pace to make an oral insulin capsule a reality for millions of diabetics around the world while we are quite excited about the progress we have made with our oral insulin capsule oramed is also focused on the oral delivery of other drugs and vaccines through our proprietary platform technology and we expect to share our developments in these areas with you as well
2374203 the language in there is so similar to the language in the left behind books
2374204 it should be known that in 2008 the world shall be blessed they will call him the one
2374205 obama is correct in saying that the world is ready for someone like him a messiah like figure charismatic and glib the bible calls that leader the antichrist and it seems apparent that the world is now ready to make his acquaintance

2374217 our goal is to see a crowd of 75 000 people at obamas nomination speech holding their hands above their heads fingers laced together in support of a new direction for this country a renewed hope and acceptance of responsibility for our future
2374218 we thought lets try and start a movement where even while walking down the street people would hold up the o and you would know that they were for obama
2374219 you interlace your hands in a circle the interlacing being a symbol of different types of people coming together and the circle a symbol of unity
2374220 we want to see it everywhere but more importantly we want this sign to take the world by storm
2374221 animals cannot just be sacrificed for the interest of political leaders
2374222 it is strange when india talks of progress in science and technology and is clamping down on child marriages it is allowing such practices as animal sacrifices in temples
2374223 how can anyone interfere with a religious practice inside a temple complex
2374224 europe works fairly well in many areas with the current treaties
2374225 we had originally made reservations for an eu debate in the autumn and perhaps a referendum due to the irish referendum the situation is now so unclear that the plan is no longer current
2374226 a full fledged adjustment phase has begun for the euro
2374227 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2374228 the pain of the long journey since 2006 was about to be renewed
2374229 john has spoken in a long on camera interview i hope you watch admitting ones mistakes is a hard thing for anyone to do and i am proud of the courage john showed by his honesty in the face of shame the toll on our family of news helicopters over our house and reporters in our driveway is yet unknown but now the truth is out and the repair work that began in 2006 will continue
2374230 i ask that the public who expressed concern about the harm johns conduct has done to us think also about the real harm that the present voyeurism does and give me and my family the privacy we need at this time
2374231 madness is like gravity all you need is a little push
2374232 i want to prove myself lets be honest im not coming off the greatest year in my career so this is a great opportunity for me
2374233 being captain its my obligation to get this team to the playoffs i plan on making this team a contender every single year and i think we are putting the right guys together to do that

2374236 las primeras sensaciones han sido buenas porque conozco a muchos compa eros eran gente de la cantera como m chel salva amaya regreso a casa porque me cri en el rayo

2374238 jugar con alves kanout luis fabiano te da experiencia te asientas y maduras espero desplegar lo aprendido para hacerme un hueco en un equipo muy completo
2374239 no debemos pasar apuros y si podemos luchar por el ascenso mejor
2374240 son muy importantes pero tambi n es verdad que siempre est la oferta y la demanda de mercado cuento plenamente que los dos se queden
2374241 espero que el equipo d un paso m s en su preparaci n y que corrija algunos aspectos de su juego nos gustar a mejorar la defensa porque en el ltimo encuentro no estuvimos bien en tareas defensivas y debemos generar m s ocasiones de gol y m s llegadas no creamos mucho peligro
2374242 we recognize that all human beings have the right to the preservation of life religion property intellect and dignity no muslim or christian should deny the other these rights nor should they tolerate the denigration or desecration of one anothers sacred symbols founding figures or places of worship
2374243 denounce and deplore threats made against those who engage in interfaith dialogue
2374244 i t is a legitimate means of expression and an essential tool in the quest for the common good
2374245 these were religious people they weren t interested in diluting their faiths
2374246 and in that a type of sincerity emerged that was perhaps the greatest benefit of the initiative
2374247 muslims feel they have been stereotyped and stigmatized in the media as evangelical christians we feel the same stereotyping
2374248 we are a diverse community of christians yet we are often portrayed through the media as being tied to one political agenda one view of eschatology and intolerant of all others
2374249 just as we promise to seek to move beyond the stereotyping of muslims found in the media can i ask you my muslim friends to get to know us beyond what is reported in the newspapers and television programs if we are going to continue to build this new bridge this must be a part of the architecture
2374250 but as the conference panel discussions would reveal no one backed away from the core assertions of their faith
2374251 we recognize that all human beings have the right to the preservation of life religion property intellect and dignity no muslim or christian should deny the other these rights nor should they tolerate the denigration or desecration of one anothers sacred symbols founding figures or places of worship

2374267 ik kom mn huis bijna niet uit doordat ik lijd aan pleinvrees de dieren zijn een soort alternatief voor buiten ze horen tot mijn beperkt geworden leefwereld
2374268 ik ben iemand die moeilijk kan wennen nu is het eindelijk mijn huisje we waren net van plan het hier op te knappen toen ik te horen kreeg dat de woonbron me eruit wil zetten
2374269 er werd toen ze in 2003 langskwamen na klachten gevraagd of ik een geboortekaartje wilde sturen als de nieuwe puppies geboren waren ze vonden het zo staat ook in een brief allemaal dik in orde
2374270 maar op dat stuk grond laat iedereen zijn hond uit er is nooit bewezen dat wij die stank veroorzaken ik heb ook nooit politie aan de deur gehad de kinderbescherming kwam onlangs langs om te kijken hoe het met baby giovanni ging de conclusie niemand hoeft zich zorgen te maken om het joch

2374273 im definitely feeling good and i just have to continue doing it every week
2374274 everybody knows how the cfl works the flip flops the first half of the season and the second half of the season teams get hot and you want to be in first place
2374275 to be in first place says a lot because everybody talent wise theres a lot of parity
2374276 thats the great balance of our team theres a lot of weapons
2374277 there would always be one play that we dont make and weve got to make that play to keep the drive going
2374278 like ryan expressed some guys are playing good some arent
2374279 in this sport as everybody knows its not a one man show its the team the team has to win and were not getting a team effort right now
2374280 debemos observar los progresos sustanciales que hemos podido lograr pero tambi n el largo trecho que nos falta por recorrer
2374281 en el pasado los gobiernos han sido c mplices en genocidios apropiaci n de tierras masiva degradaci n ambiental y muchos otros abusos negando a los pueblos ind genas sus derechos y libertades fundamentales
2374282 las medidas administrativas o legislativas adecuadas para prevenir los actos de corporaciones transnacionales en territorios ind genas
2374283 generalmente implica el reconocimiento de injusticias pasadas y justicia para las v ctimas
2374284 ofrece la oportunidad para que los estados y los pueblos ind genas fortalezcan sus relaciones promuevan la reconciliaci n y aseguren que no se repita el pasado
2374285 el p blico debe entender los derechos y preocupaciones de los pueblos ind genas y tiene que actuar para protegerlos porque siendo el grupo m s marginalizado del mundo muestra c mo seremos tratados el resto de nosotros tambi n representa la forma m s segura de proteger los ecosistemas que a n quedan

2374287 la conferencia ha sido una buena oportunidad para plantear diferentes enfoques en temas pol ticos y financieros ante el sida pero faltan acciones concretas sobre los c mo y los qu
2374288 es un encuentro tan enorme que a veces uno no puede ver la complejidad el c mulo de relaciones que se establecen y los compromisos que se hacen
2374289 a veces no somos capaces de recibir la informaci n completa de qu es lo que est pasando
2374290 ese acuerdo hist rico es una muestra del nivel de compromiso en la regi n y ser responsabilidad de la comunidad el llevar a cabo la auditor a social para que ese acuerdo sea cumplido
2374291 todos los grupos que se consideran mayormente afectados como los hombres que tienen sexo con hombres y los trabajadores del sexo comercial tienen que participar en las pol ticas p blicas el punto es que de la conferencia salga mayor participaci n de estos grupos en sus pa ses porque nadie sabe mejor su problema que ellos mismos
2374292 en estas reuniones hay mucha ret rica pero faltan medidas especificas y buena parte del trabajo recae en la instancia de decisiones pol ticas
2374293 el sida no sea s lo un tema de cinco d as
2374294 la comunidad de gobiernos organismos internacionales y grupos no gubernamentales sale fortalecida de la conferencia hemos visto el compromiso pol tico de los l deres
2374295 tenemos que construir una agenda de salud para enfrentar el vih y otras enfermedades
2374296 mi evaluaci n de la conferencia es muy positiva para m xico para am rica latina en el caso de m xico la cobertura de medios prensa radio y televisi n fue de tal magnitud que ninguna campa a que nosotros hubi ramos hecho hubiera tenido tal penetraci n
2374297 pero m s all de m xico se logr visibilizar la situaci n de am rica latina porque es un epidemia que normalmente pasa inadvertida y eso hace que el resto del mundo no la tome en cuenta o no la priorice
2374298 a estas conferencias no vienen responsables de tomar decisiones p blicas con la capacidad de firmar algo a excepci n en este caso de los ministros de salud y de educaci n de la regi n el resto de la gente que particip vino con la necesidad de aprender y compartir experiencias esperamos que muchas de las recomendaciones aqu vertidas las tomen en cuenta los pa ses

2374304 we created the shelby terlingua racing team so our small group of rebels could have some real fun

2374308 though the terlingua racing team flew under the radar after shelby stopped building gt350s and gt500s in the 1960s its flying high again today
2374309 with shelby autos creating terlingua racing team edition versions of the ford mustang and cobra it was time to bring back some of the extracurricular activities that make racing and life so much more meaningful

2374317 i guess it needs to be there if that many people are running red lights

2374330 online casinos survey results have always been difficult to gauge
2374331 but we consulted many unaffiliated survey groups institutions of higher learning and professional demographic firms about how to create a quality online casinos survey that would produce great results
2374332 i want to emphasize that we are not compensating surveyees for their answers but for their time
2374333 and typical protocol for any long survery such as this is to offer coffee snacks and token gifts to participants to provide comfort and a stress free atmosphere
2374334 i swore i would never take part in big business but the ramifications of this project do benefit higher education and the community at large
2374335 well have a fantastic array of fresh information to use
2374336 i cant thank boike kraus enough for putting together such an organized event its one thing to come up with an idea but another to follow through with it and take care of all the logistical problems it presents
2374337 its none of their business what my family income is and how many children i wish to have
2374338 all online casinos information and demographic data gathered in this survey is 100 completely anonymous we ask for no personal identification or names
2374339 were psyched about this project and want to make it an annual event
2374340 and our plans are already in motion to secure a survey facility data analysis bureau and publishers for next year

2374347 fencing and other safety measures are recommended by the u s consumer product safety commission for large inflatables as well as conventional in ground and above ground pools
2374348 safety standards vary widely and their enforcement is far from vigorous in some communities
2374349 capt craig evans of the germantown police department said his department lacks the resources to patrol neighborhoods for compliance with a village ordinance that requires fencing around any pool with water deeper than 18 inches
2374350 the village is considering an ordinance that would allow police to issue tickets to students if they violate rules about the use of cell phones and other electronic devices in schools
2374351 police chief peter hoell said he thinks the ordinance would be used only a couple of times a year
2374352 the village board is expected to approve the ordinance aug 18 given that is was unanimously recommended this week by the boards public safety committee

2374356 those were the days when foreigners and the chinese danced at separate discos nobody owned cars and foreigners used a separate currency called foreign exchange certificates simons told
2374357 but china looks at sports politically its a government game
2374358 i was extremely happy on 13 july 2001 when china won the bid to host the olympics
2374359 but ive become disillusioned it started as a wonderful opportunity for china to open up
2374360 the olympics has put sports reform in china back by a decade
2374361 the danger is that china thinks the olympics is the end of its sports journey but it should be the beginning of a new sports revolution in china

2374477 its been kind of a nagging shoulder i dont know if it means a whole hill of beans out there
2374478 he wont get tackled if he stays in a green jersey but when we do our thud stuff its hard for him not to get run into or bump into somebody trying to go through the line he could be in there on a tackle day but they just cant tackle him to the ground
2374479 when hes working tonys running backs coach drills and whether hes going through the blaster or just any kind of drill where you might practice pass protection on that side tony can see that hes favoring it some
2374480 knowshons not a guy who is going to go to the trainer and say his shoulder hurts a little bit its more of a coachs discretion on that one
2374481 i think hes got a special ability to go along with his physical ability
2374482 there have been none that have been at georgia since ive been here im not saying hes the best one but theres no one weve had thats like him
2374483 just ability wise hes outstanding but lets let him make a few plays before we don him anything
2374484 right now were just trying to find the best five and right guard especially has been in flux more than any other position
2374485 cordy has a big ole body and hes got some great punch hes not totally lost of course hes got another lineman standing by him telling what to do but theres nothing wrong with that at all
2374486 its not like the other guys dont have a good attitude or are not trying real hard
2374487 but so far nobody has caught the eyes of the coaching to suggest that hes legitimately fighting for a starting role or a lot of playing time
2374488 its been shocking truly probably more so for a j than for deangelo
2374489 i love coach garner to death but its tough but he wants us to be the best that we can we know we have to keep working hard
2374490 they withered a little bit in practice but i was proud of the way that they came back
2374491 yeah he said 322 but i asked him what we weighed before practice he said that he didnt know so that made me a little scared right there
2374492 you dont know i dont know what that indicated either hes real heavy or hes got another issue going on
2374493 the pace of the game is so much faster than theyre used to the guys so much more athletic and he came in a little heavy i told him that was going to hurt him and i think hes finding that out

2374511 cosmopolitanization is a non linear dialectical process in which the universal and the particular the similar and the dissimilar the global and the local are to be conceived not as cultural polarities but as interconnected and reciprocally interpenetrating principles
2374512 this is what i call methodological nationalism what do i mean by this i mean that sociology has been historically concerned with the analysis of societies with each society being based upon a distinct national state or nation state so there is a system of nation states and accompanying sociologies that study their particular society defined in nation state terms the nation state constitutes the container of society and the boundary of sociology

2374600 not only is it bad for the gators and for c i its bad for college football because ingram will be the poster boy for every junior with a decision to make

2374603 the only thing i want to do is help them win figure out my role early on the team
2374604 if its not starting then whatever i have to do to help the team win thats all i want to do
2374605 my goal was to be 315 pounds when i came here i was 317 actually and the back injury set me back a couple pounds i gained probably eight pounds but ive been shedding them during camp
2374606 when i got here i got a little bit closer to guys
2374607 i got to work with them a little bit before the other freshmen got in it made a big difference
2374608 los angeles was really fast it was city life it was a real fast life
2374609 there wasnt much time to be to yourself thats why i love gainesville i feel like i have more time to myself more quiet time
2374610 if im not spiritually right then i wont play football to the best of my ability hes the one who gives me strength hes the one that gives me comfort sometimes at practice ill look to him and start praying thats the difference between this season and all the other seasons is that hes really captured my heart the holy spirit is the one that guides me
2374611 i dont have any thoughts on that because i dont think about it much
2374612 my mind isnt always on football its on other things like god he definitely comes first football just falls into place
2374613 thats going to be the difference if i get comfortable with the offense so i can just play instead of thinking about what steps to take
2374614 the main reason santa is so jolly is because he knows where all the bad girls live
2374615 the most important thing for the u s government to do is not just offer words but offer deeds
2374616 an emphasis on universal as opposed to race specific programs isnt just good policy
2374617 tax laws that restore some balance to the distribution of the nations wealth
2374618 so many of the disparities that exist in the african american community today can be directly traced to inequalities passed on from an earlier generation that suffered under the brutal legacy of slavery and jim crow
2374619 ive met the girls a couple of times but i havent met the guys its all about getting to the practice venue and saying hello showing your face and if they want to use us fine if they dont likewise its nice just to come along and show your support at the training sessions
2374620 its sensational mate its a real privilege to be here to get up so close and personal with so many sports and training venues and to see what they have put into their sports i feel really honoured to be here
2374621 ive met most of them over the past six to nine months just to try and build up a relationship and if any of the athletes need some words from us the three mentors i guess our role is to pass on our own experiences in sport
2374622 the idea of twenty20 cricket at the olympics is definitely worth pursuing if you want to globalise the game then you have to look at including countries like china and the united states and getting cricket into the olympics will fast track that move
2374623 the chance to stand on top of the olympic podium to wear an olympic gold medal and the pride of belting out your national anthem would be a life changing experience
2374624 ive paid for your mistakes your time is borrowed your time has come to be erased

2374628 when we beat tennessee and we had so many young guys they figured were a lot better than we think we are and we really werent good at that point
2374629 the disappointing part about it all is we just didnt play well we never gelled
2374630 it was like we were separate units out there like the defensive line had their plan the linebackers had theirs and the secondary had theirs we were just never a defense no one was a leader no one stood up and said lets go two years ago we had reggie nelson ray mcdonald and guys who would say were not going to put up with this that did not happen last season
2374631 on the defensive side of the ball we were confused last season
2374632 i think were much more confident much more prepared for the season there are a lot of positives going on no 1 there is overall more maturity last year we had one senior player tony joiner and derrick harvey only two players who had played there before
2374633 you think a year of maturity the ups and downs you cant be taught other than going through it
2374634 we went through the ebbs and flows of a tough season last year it didnt end up the way we wanted it to thats all part of the maturing process
2374635 were going to be a more mature outfit hopefully handling adversity better and then making the critical plays there were a number of situations where somebody had to step up and make a football play last season and we didnt do it
2374636 teams didnt really have to run the ball because they threw it on us
2374637 we would get the lead and people would say lets just throw the football they cant rush the passer they cant cover anybody we were bad on third down we couldnt get teams off the field
2374638 i just know joe haden is a better football player than he was a year ago and wondy is a better football player
2374639 we are a better football team and the secondary is a lot better than it was
2374640 we had some young guys last season when the ball was in the air they missed the opportunity to make plays
2374641 i think youre going to see a major difference this year confidence comes with experience
2374642 we have experience now and guys are not going to be afraid to make mistakes when youre afraid to make mistakes thats all you do is make mistakes those guys are going to fly around and be confident and not be worried about the what ifs theyre going to be doers of the game
2374643 we got a lesson in how to play footy tonight an absolute lesson in how to play team football at a ruthless and unforgiving level a level we couldnt even match from the first minute to the last minute
2374644 i dont think we had a winner anywhere and we were second rate
2374645 they use the ball well and they move the ball quickly
2374646 at the end of the day the scoreboard shows us exactly the true indication of how we played on how well they were going and how effective they were
2374647 we got a real big lesson on how to play team football team football is paramount they do it at a level which were not near
2374648 we were turning the ball over mainly because of their good play and their good pressure and theyre incredibly effective on the counter attack
2374649 theres a connection between a lot of their players that was very difficult for us to match
2374650 yo le he ofrecido una prueba es que es una gran oportunidad para nosotros

2374661 as a mother it is incredible to me that any government regards itself as having a right to prevent women from having children western nations are complicit in this policy because they fund un agencies which work alongside chinese population controllers
2374662 many people i have spoken to about this subject including women who would regard themselves as feminists shrug their shoulders as if it isnt that important
2374663 reproductive rights just arent that important when the woman actually wants to have a baby the hypocrisy is disgraceful
2374664 today is about expressing our opposition to the one child policy and the indirect support it receives from most leading western governments including australia we are bearing witness to our hope that the chinese government will end the terrible violence inflicted upon their own people and embrace a culture that respects the dignity and rights of all human beings
2374665 religion that is pure and undefiled before god the father is this to care for orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself unstained by the world

2374668 we really were surprised at the level of trust we found
2374669 on april 15 2008 without warning more than a dozen workers and police knocked down the wall surrounding nis house in qianzheng hutong in the central xicheng district of beijing according to her husband dong jiqin when ni tried to protect her home she was hit on head with a brick and dragged to the ground by one of the demolition workers police detained ni and accused her of assaulting a demolition worker according to information from china human rights defender chrd a chinese human rights monitoring group police at the xinjiekou police station beat ni until she lost consciousness they also confiscated her crutches without which she has extreme difficulty standing on april 29 the beijing public security bureau of xicheng district formally arrested her on charges of obstructing a public official article 277 of the criminal law a charge that carries a maximum sentence of three years in prison
2374670 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have had seven years to deliver on their pledges that these games would further human rights instead the beijing games have prompted a rollback in some of the most basic rights enshrined in chinas constitution and international law
2374671 the magnitude of the dollars moves and the breaking of key technical levels suggest that a major shift in the outlook towards the dollar is occurring as massive positions are adjusted

2375023 i pray you will feel the delight of the lord he did not bring us not to meet us here
2375024 im not going to forget any of you in the locations
2375025 an event of this magnitude is a god sized event
2375026 weve had a lot of people working hard to make this event happen but ultimately everything was in gods hands
2375027 the significance of this event is that women gathered in local churches rather than travel to an arena location

2375040 because shes bloody sexy when she gets into a good rant
2375041 im not trying to pressure you or anything nobody is more surprised than i am that ive been thinking about this stuff its just well of course my career is important to me but i just will you at least think about it
2375042 i just looked around the common room and i saw you
2375043 you walked through the portrait hole and i started running toward you and i just couldnt stop
2375044 i was going to cook you dinner and have candles and wine and everything
2375045 but i thought id get too nervous to eat somehow i thought id be braver at breakfast

2375061 this has been a very involved sensitive and complicated investigation
2375062 these were kids were who taken from parental custody family custody for a variety of reasons and also youth who had been charged with criminal offences
2375063 mine happened in a secure unit where thered be two staff working and if you went downstairs with the staff only one would go down there with you the other one had to stay up with the other kids thats where my abuse happened
2375064 and what do you do youd get a cigarette and hed tell us straight that no ones going to believe you
2375065 whos gonna believe us most of us were criminals locked up as kids
2375066 people had to know i mean this abuse went on for decades why didnt the media pick up on this before because it was kind of hushed up
2375067 police and prosecutors want to be careful correctly about not laying serious charges unless theyre confident theyre going to achieve a conviction
2375068 ive always wanted to do that havent you of course you probably would already know what it feels like dont you

2375082 the ultimate goal is to equip those who attend to maintain and improve their fitness level people get more motivated when they go to the personal trainer but when they leave the ultimate goal of the trainer like the goal of the church is for the person to live outside what theyve learned inside the gym
2375083 the church and the parent should work hand in hand the pastor provides a level of instruction that the parent probably cant fully provide his goal is to equip the parent with an appropriate level of instruction the parent is not only to be an instructor but a model
2375084 even the redeemed heart has an inclination toward sin our hearts need to be strengthened by grace
2375085 people in the gym who are looking in the mirror all the time
2375086 christ cant flow through you into the world if your heart is clogged with spiritual plaque
2375087 it requires that we know the heart of god but also that we acknowledge that our own hearts are unfit
2375088 to get at the core of it is to understand who god is and to understand the depths of our own need
2375089 god calls the shots through scripture you must live your life for the purpose of godliness according to the scriptures

2375202 usually when you need to use any usb device like scanner flash memory etc you plug it into usb port of your computer but for all that the device is accessible only for the computer it is plugged into and what if someone else needs to use the same usb device
2375203 you can unplug usb device from your pc and give it to another user but according to different circumstances not always there is a possibility to give usb device to another user even for a while or you can allow another user to work with that device on your pc but sometimes it is not possible to allow someone else to work with that usb device on your pc especially if another user is in the another office city or country it is possible to purchase the same usb devices additionally but additional usb devices could be purchased but it depends on the cost of the device and quantity required

2375218 why have we not been attacked again competing and complementary hypotheses for homeland attack frequency
2375219 the hypotheses analyzed in this report can be divided roughly into two broad categories the first category capabilities suggests that terrorists have been unable to succeed in conducting another large scale attack on the homeland due to the effectiveness of u s defenses or because of the terrorists limited capabilities the second category motivations assumes that a number of terrorist groups possess the ability to attack the united states but have chosen not to do so for a variety of reasons
2375220 this study suggests that identifying a complete and consistent explanation for the non occurrence of a subsequent attack on the u s homeland may not be possible

2375251 i can see our discussion with the eu on the fta taking a relatively long period our fta with india itself has taken five years so what they are doing now is a survey on which members are willing to move forward so that they concentrate on the readiness of those countries
2375252 it will take a period of time to identify which member states and in which sector they are willing to open up and to negotiate to move forward with the rights of others to follow later on
2375253 it will be a formula that is moving forward but at the same time is not imposing and restricting not pushing and pulling anybody who is not willing to go along
2375254 theres a tradition in archaeology of saying people dont move very much they just transfer ideas

2375281 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance
2375282 were going to have a very clear message about how the campaign will cooperate and how the convention will be conducted when its appropriate to make that announcement
2375283 we will remember this tragedy for the rest of our lives
2375284 they are killing civilians women and children with heavy artillery and rockets
2375285 georgian military forces completely control all the territory of south ossetia
2375286 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2375287 i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness
2375288 you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2375289 i have responded to consistently to these tabloid allegations by saying i dont respond to these lies
2375290 the fact that it is a mistake that many others have made before him did not make it any easier for me to hear when he told me what he had done
2375291 i think the longer these allegations go unanswered and unresponded to the more difficult it is for the people producing the convention to give him a prominent spot
2375292 but i would expect that he would not speak or have any role at the convention unless this is cleared up
2375293 this is a difficult and painful time for them and i think they need to work through that process of healing
2375294 my sense is that thats going to be their top priority
2375295 john edwards was a great champion of working people during the first of this campaign many of his themes are ones that democrats as a whole share those will be amplified at the convention
2375296 my thoughts and prayer are with the edwards family today
2375297 it is time for me to step aside so that history can blaze its path

2375303 represent a collection of degenerative diseases for which there are no good treatments and more importantly no good animal models for the most part in studying them
2375304 the hope is that this will accelerate research and it will create a climate of openness
2375305 at least for the foreseeable future and i would argue forever they are going to be extremely valuable tools
2375306 in my almost 20 years first as a prosecutor and now as an attorney general i cannot recall ever seeing let alone hearing of a situation where a police officer trying to serve a subpoena was assaulted
2375307 i dont claim to have a good understanding of what your responsibilities are but i have to look at how the court system is run and perceived by the public
2375308 the calvo family members were the apparent victims of a local drug ring
2375309 i called him to express my sorrow and regret for that and for the loss of the familys beloved dogs
2375310 the deputies opened fire and executed our dogs the very second they broke down our front door
2375311 we were harmed by the very people who took an oath to protect us
2375312 the vice president looks forward to participating in the republican national convention and continuing to work for the election of senator mccain and other republican candidates in the coming months
2375313 i think its the meanest thing that could ever have happened to her
2375314 although john believes he should stand alone and take the consequences of his action now when the door closes behind him he has his family waiting for him
2375315 you know what shes still really bright and i still have a lot of respect for her
2375316 my heart goes out to her she shouldnt have to deal with this after all she has been through from the loss of her son wade to her brave battle against cancer
2375317 i dont think its anyone elses business whats going on in their marriage
2375318 i feel for elizabeth edwards and i also feel that shes the only person allowed to make any judgment in this situation
2375319 just because there has been an affair doesnt mean you dont have a strong marriage
2375320 marriages survive infidelity when both decide to repair and forgive
2375321 ok tell reporters its none of their business but dont lie
2375322 is he lying about the baby being his as well
2375323 this informs what cate will know about relationships with men
2375324 it informs how she will deal with her own relationships with men
2375325 if the government heard the jurys message it will not use a flawed war court to prosecute conduct that does not violate the laws of war
2375326 the lesson i hope the government learns from this case amongst other things is dont bring skimpy or weak charges of conspiracy
2375327 i think this is the big five and they want to get them into court before the election so they can validate this process
2375328 we firmly oppose any words or acts that interfere in other countries internal affairs using human rights and religion and other issues

2375330 this has got to be a historic moment father and son two presidents opening an embassy my dad was a fabulous president
2375331 this was probably the most important development of the campaign this week
2375332 thats why we think this is important its the furthest thing from straight talk you can imagine
2375333 it dramatically distorts what occurred in order to serve his own political end
2375334 the people of ohio dont deserve that kind of leadership
2375335 such mutual clarification can pave the way for a speedy and transparent negotiating process with a bright prospect
2375336 the republic of iran is ready to provide a clear response to your proposal at the earliest possibility while simultaneously expecting to receive your clear response to our questions and ambiguities as well
2375337 the second phase of negotiations can commence as early as possible if there is such willingness
2375338 our offer is clear and their response is not clear
2375339 the iranian government needs to respond in a very clear way to the generous offer from the international community
2375340 its a stalling tactic reiterating that they have goodwill but not answering the exam question
2375341 to be fair to the iranians they do this kind of thing rather well
2375342 i dont see any reason to believe that the russians and the chinese are any more willing today to support really tougher sanctions against iran
2375343 in a short time approximately 31 300 individual charitable and small business investor accounts will receive more than 8 2 billion in liquidity and approximately 9 200 investor accounts holding tax exempt auction preferred shares will receive nearly 3 3 billion in liquidity

2375435 this was a concept i was discussing with eric willis a few weeks ago when the opportunity rose for media mayhem to work with nassiri
2375436 we got to thinking about the timing of the 2008 olympic games in beijing as well as a number of other pressing events around the world and we wanted to be part of something positive out there and this is media mayhems way of doing our part to raise awareness that love is blind and sees no color

2375441 over the years a number of business acquisitions have resulted in peel ports operating several disparate purchasing and stores systems this has meant a lot of rekeying and duplication of data which over time has became a significant issue for us it has also become increasingly difficult to get meaningful and timely cost control information we needed to implement a group wide procurement system to overcome these problems and help us to streamline the whole purchasing process right across the business
2375442 our brief was to find a system that our business users would find easy to use we cited amazon com as an example of the simplicity we were looking for from the system we wanted it had to be easy to use and it had to deliver clear business benefit it also had to integrate with our sunsystems financial management system and we felt that proactis ticked these and other important boxes
2375443 sapphires pre sales team really went that extra mile to ensure that our business could thoroughly review the benefits of proactis we had several demonstrations and to validate our requirements fully we asked sapphire to prove a number of key business scenarios to us by way of user workshops sapphire put in a lot of personal time to ensure that we were totally happy with system
2375444 the real work begins now and there will be challenging times ahead in re designing existing processes and changing current behaviours in order to maximise the benefits of the proactis system we are looking forward to sapphire sharing their previous experiences to help us with this
2375445 when the system is fully live we hope to realise such benefits as enhanced visibility over spend and clearly mandated processes that will help to manage and regulate our purchasing procedures we look forward to proactis being able to provide a simple clearly defined procurement process for all our business users and a one stop shop for all our purchasing needs
2375446 we are delighted to be welcoming peel ports to sapphires growing proactis customer community proactis will provide peel ports with real cost savings by having one business wide procurement system peel ports will not only be able to procure more efficiently but they will have full visibility over their cost pipeline too which in the current economic climate is vital for any business big or small

2375453 earlier actresses preferred to stick to saris for award shows appearances and premieres but now they want a look that is in sync with international trends
2375454 its a strong look glamorous elegant formal and sophisticated at the same time and it has caught on
2375455 a lot of the work i do for bollywood films requires western clothes and there are very few who do western wear without embellishment
2375456 there is a classicism yet theatrical element to their gowns and dresses
2375457 but we continued because we like such clothes also when we put the tamer versions of the dramatic ramp looks on our racks we always found takers for them
2375458 women here are more curvaceous and slightly broader on the hips our bodies are different from women in the west and we know that women like our form fitting styles and also the fact that we highlight the best part of a womans body
2375459 i never need alterations in their clothes im really comfortable in their outfits
2375460 sometimes we dont even know who is wearing our label recently we met lara dutta in delhi and were surprised to see that she was wearing our dress when we asked her where she got it from she said she picked it up at zoya in bandra mumbai
2375461 i wear a lot of gauri and nainika actually i like that sort of semi formal minimalistic look with a great cut i was very excited when i discovered them
2375462 we have designed some gowns for her to wear on stage for this tour and she has also picked up corsets
2375463 we took what we thought would work and met at her hotel she tried on everything and took all the eight pieces we had selected for her
2375464 deepika told us she was looking for something for an award ceremony she was fine with whatever we thought would work for her we sent her swatches and few sketches and then made the gown
2375465 whenever i think of freedom i dont normally think of it in the usual context

2375467 being able to do what you want to and pushing yourself to do the best in that is how i think young indians define freedom today i am no different
2375468 for me freedom is not what our parents grandparents or even the artisans whom we work with define it as its not about india and the raj but about individual growth and expression

2375556 in the backdrop of communal and urban rural divides and debates over regional identities the two faces of india seemed enormously important to me and i was tempted to build the bridge between them

2375573 the united states will videotape and sound record the interviews between representatives of your government and the detainee s named above
2375574 obviously we knew that interrogations by foreign personnel were recorded since omars canadian lawyers had obtained release of the canadian videos from the canadian government whats interesting is that we learn more and more each day about evidence that exists in these cases that was previously secret
2375575 although mr khadr is no longer a juvenile he was 15 years old when he was alleged to have committed crimes in afghanistan canada has sought to ensure that the treatment of mr khadr is consistent with internationally recognized norms and standards for the treatment of juvenile offenders and that his age at the time the alleged events occurred is considered in all parts of the process
2375576 we remain concerned that other governments were in there and were complicit whether or not they were involved in ill treatment
2375577 the tapes could be evidence of human rights violations or criminal behaviour

2375582 may explain why prosecutors have fought so hard not to disclose evidence of omars interrogations at bagram and guantanamo bay
2375583 being able to do what you want to and pushing yourself to do the best in that is how i think young indians define freedom today i am no different
2375584 for me freedom is not what our parents grandparents or even the artisans whom we work with define it as its not about india and the raj but about individual growth and expression
2375585 our label defines us it is how we express ourselves if you like what we make you have to take it with our branding
2375586 explaining concepts to artisans who dont want to try anything new watching them stay content with designs they have worked on for centuries has been frustrating
2375587 the leap did not blend in with our idea of freedom which is about individual growth

2375596 i wanted to leave something for the reader and have chosen to focus more on moments in his journey rather than provide one definitive conclusion
2375597 the generation of indian writers writing in english before ours had a deeply ingrained sense of being colonized and it was difficult for them to move away from that model that language and yet create something that is of abiding literary value now indian writers are breaking out of the sense of being colonized and creating a new language that for me is creative freedom
2375598 you have to come away from a place and your experiences in it to be able to write about them

2376076 1 to what extent does business and professions code section 16600 prohibit employee noncompetition agreements and 2 is a contract provision requiring an employee to release
2376077 claims that in any way arise from or out of are based upon or relate to employees employment by association with or compensation from
2376078 courts have interpreted labor code section 2804 to apply to labor code section 2802 making all contracts that waive an employees right to indemnification null and void thus indemnity rights are nonwaivable and any contract that does purport to waive an employees indemnity right would be contrary to the law and therefore unlawful to that extent
2376079 we apply this rule in holding that a contract provision releasing any and all claims such as that used in the tonc in the present case does not encompass nonwaivable statutory protections such as the employee indemnity protection of section labor code 2802 in so holding we interpret the tonc such that it does not violate labor code section 2804 as a consequence the tonc is neither unlawful nor null and void

2376195 i dont consciously think that the people i see through movies tv and magazines are artificial still seeing juliette binoche all the time registers in my brain
2376196 our research suggests that our brains dont discount the women on the cover of cosmo even when subjects know these women are models subjects judge an average attractive woman as less desirable as a date after just having seen models
2376197 when the concept of most beautiful people in the world tends to be the same for everyone it becomes more and more difficult to make more people happy
2376198 if men found themselves being less attracted to their mates after being exposed to eight or 16 pictures in a half hour experiment what would be the effect if that happened day in day out for 20 years
2376199 there appears to be something about male teachers who come in daily contact with teenaged women that increases the likelihood of being currently divorced or separated
2376200 most real life divorces happen because one or the other spouse is dissatisfied with their mate
2376201 the contrast effect can explain why men might unconsciously become dissatisfied they dont know why they suddenly find their middle aged wives not appealing anymore their exposure to young women might be a reason
2376202 we want it we need it and our ancestors didnt have enough of it

2376205 it is better to utilise bmc funds for water supply and other health services than building college cum hospitals if the service is not used by mumbaikars it is not the bmcs obligation to fund medical colleges
2376206 mumbai desperately needs more medical college cum hospitals it is sad that we have more private medical colleges than government ones the bmc has opened only one medical college nair in the last 50 years

2376211 look i love julie garfields real name i was with him onstage in golden boy and hes a hell of an actor but in truckline cafe we had a kid whos just this much better theres something in him i cant describe some unique kind of magic i want the kid his name is marlon brando
2376212 we need a marquee name not some unknown not when we can get a star like john garfield whos perfect for it
2376213 either we go with the kid or get another director
2376214 became fascinated by the way he tore through blanches pretentious wardrobe trunk
2376215 it was different every night somehow he found something new and interesting to do
2376216 while marlon and i were sharing our dressing room we noticed that cash and valuables would disappear
2376217 thats marlon always for the underdog always worried about the little guys on the bottom all over the world
2376218 for you its one picture and a good role thats it
2376219 you know its so fuckin cold out here theres no way you cn overact
2376220 look as soon as charlie maguire our assistant director calls lunch lets go down in the kitchen and have it out once and for all
2376221 all right marlon weve been hearing about this fucking thing for too long what in hell is bothering you about the cab scene
2376222 look in the script ive got all that stuff to say about you were my brother you should of been looking out for me a whole big speech and all the time rod steiger has a gun pointing at me it doesnt work i dont believe it how cn anybody play that scene with a gun in his face i wont do it
2376223 what if you just reach out and put the gun down and then pick up your lines
2376224 its a good thing i was a happily married woman
2376225 his coming on to her in the scene made her so uncomfortable that kazan came up and whispered a single word in her ear
2376226 on the night that streetcar opened he walked into our apartment at two oclock in the morning he was wearing a black turtleneck t shirt and jeans same as always but i could tell from his stride that his life had changed but i knew not to mention it to him you couldnt say you were great tonight marlon then youd be out of the club it was like a club or a domain all the in people and he was the president or the duke and he made up the rules like never praising his work or mentioning his fame it came to him so suddenly and he really hated it he spent his whole life trying to run away from it but of course he couldnt he was on his way to being the most famous actor in the world and the more famous he got the more he hated it if people came up to him and asked for his autograph he was rude to them he carried it to extremes when we were in italy roberto rossellini asked me if i would introduce him to marlon i said sure come up here was the famous director of open city and other great films marlon was on his bed in his shorts and didnt even bother to get up he was unbelievably rude because rossellini said what an honor it was to meet him and how much he admired him all of us in the club knew that was a no no fame was marlons cross and he was going to suffer it the rest of his life he did the same with farley granger in venice farley mentioned a part he was up for and marlon said oh yes i turned it down i thought his behavior was disgusting
2376227 and i left him that time we had lots of fights years later i happened to mention farley and marlon said i believe i treated him very shabbily so of course he remembered he remembered everything every last detail he loved to study people and being famous got in the way of that because now they were looking at him instead of the way it had been before before the fame
2376228 buddy marlons nickname learns so fast ive already got him hooking off the jab and he moves so nice hes a natural i can make a helluva fighter out of this kid

2376241 and i said what do i think of you i think you are nothing nothing and marlon began to laugh and he went on laughing and laughing
2376242 the venue and back drop for this ceremony is very appropriate considering our relationship with bc ferries
2376243 holding this ceremony on board one of bc ferries main ships underscores the importance of bc ferries as a canadian marine employer who employs many of our graduates
2376244 the students are in a unique co op program in that they forge their future by making connections in the marine industry right from the start of their program
2376245 many of the shipping companies and the marine community strongly support our programs we see this through the generosity of bc ferries hosting our celebration and the support of co op employers like princess cruises upper lakes shipping algoma central corporation vships canada secunda marine valles steamship teekay and many more

2376249 that so much money is being spent by our benefits system on people who are supposed to have come to the country to work
2376250 a liberal open immigration policy only makes sense if you also plan for its consequences it is clear that the government has failed to plan adequately both in terms of housing and funding for local services
2376251 it should be remembered however that people are only coming to britain because they are successfully providing services and doing jobs available in the british economy to the benefit of british consumers
2376252 a man with 10 wives would collapse and die but my own power is given by allah that is why i have been able to control 86 of them
2376253 i dont go looking for them they come to me i will consider the fact that god has asked me to do it and i will just marry them
2376254 to my understanding the koran does not place a limit and it is up to what your own power your own endowment and ability allows
2376255 god did not say what the punishment should be for a man who has more than four wives but he was specific about the punishment for fornication and adultery

2376310 the economy is limping along and businesses are doing whatever they can to remain competitive
2376311 so we had fewer people working shorter hours and producing more
2376312 we have a banking crisis and an agency crisis and a mortgage crisis and a coming credit card crisis weve never seen anything like that before and it all seems to be coming home to roost at the same time thats never happened either
2376313 but we did not even have credit cards in the 1930s there were no such thing as student loans
2376314 what ive said is that im playing the hand that was dealt and that my responsibility is to protect the u s economy and the american people
2376315 isnt it funny that america has to compete in ever single event
2376316 i dont think there is anything intrinsically wrong with the church growth principles weve developed yet somehow they dont seem to work i would suggest that one reason they dont work is that they tend to approach church as if it were a business but a business driven response may make things even worse in the long run if we train people to be consumers instead of communers well end up with customers instead of disciples it might fill up an auditorium but itll never turn the world upside down for christ

2376590 el xito para la nataci n espa ola es poder nadar el mayor n mero de finales posibles espa a tiene un equipo femenino de un nivel muy bueno el masculino excepto tres nadadores son todos j venes yo estar a contento si estos j venes como sergio garc a y melquiades lvarez pudieran nadar tambi n una semifinal a las chicas como zivanevskaia villa cija y belmonte que tienen otro nivel les vamos a exigir cosas diferentes
2376591 estar aqu es un sue o nadar con gente de tanta clase a veces puede dar un poco de miedo pero intentar que no me influya eso
2376592 mireia est muy bien muy animada y tranquila sabe que en las dos pruebas que nada habr que marcar un tiempo cercano al r cord del mundo para las medallas e incluso batirlo pero est mentalizada para afrontar el reto en 200 estilos est sexta en el r nking mundial yo la veo bien en las dos pruebas pero el podio va a ser dur simo
2376593 tengo 24 a os y la experiencia suficiente para afrontar los juegos mejor que los pasados en la final quiero hacer 8 20 o un poco menos no s qu puede valer una medalla un cuarto o un quinto puesto si hago esa marca ya estoy contenta es bajar menos de medio segundo cada 50 metros

2376605 qu felices nos hacen los amigos que llegan de lejos
2376606 nothing is going to change we still are best friends
2376607 we cant change our attitudes if munoz plays better and wins awesome
2376608 i can get in my own game and forget who im playing and just see how low i can go
2376609 i just told myself to stay steady and play my own game and have fun at the same time
2376610 if you start putting well the rest of the game will come along
2376611 chris had really turned the corner he changed the way he was living his approach to school his approach to playing football i didnt get a chance to talk to him last when i tried calling the hospital but im going to tell him when i see him that this just a speed bump in the road sports has a way of teaching you lessons for later in life the guys say chris spirits have been great its very important to have that positive attitude following an injury
2376612 those guys have been very very good in terms of leadership and showing the freshmen everything they need to do kind of giving them a taste of how coach hill is going to be theyre getting after them and theyve done a great job of forewarning them hey make sure you run every drill staying in the playbook making sure they do all the nuances at the position
2376613 its not only on the field its in the meeting room hes got his playbook open asking questions its not like its brand new to him its not like its a new language like you deal with most freshmen and then on the field hes very physical and he has a presence about him thats one thing you know hes in the game and hes going full speed
2376614 hes been in there running full speed trying to hit the safeties and making catches and things like that actually he still young he missed two a days last year he just needs a lot of reps like we all do in this time of year but were expecting him to help us also
2376615 right now today its kind of a receiver group by committee but as coaches you always have to adjust coach nix coach shannon well sit down and if somebody is really starting to separate himself hell be our go to guy but as of right now were going to have a receiver group by committee and find guys that can run specific routes and make plays for us
2376616 he can run as fast as he needs to if there is a 4 4 4 3 db running hell run as fast as he needs to score hes electrifying very electrifying
2376617 ive seen it at times where we do a great job at it and ive seen it at times where i have to coach it
2376618 it may go into the season we just dont know right now the doctors will let me know it may be four to six weeks i dont know
2376619 its something that happened at practice its what it happens in camp we got orlando franklin fig joel figueroa gunn harland gunn whats my buddys name a j trump so we still got four guys that played some and got some quality work in you got to move on
2376620 its bad for him because hed been coming along he dropped a lot of weight and hed been doing great in practice whatever time it takes him to come back hes got to just start over and just get back into the groove of what hes doing
2376621 the greatest reward is to witness the journey of life
2376622 nobody is allowed to participate if they have not had full health and safety training and are not wearing life jackets
2376623 the last thing we want to do is injure ourselves or anyone else
2376624 we are still planning to go ahead with it people have been preparing for this for a long time we are determined to reach kingsnorth by land sea and air
2376625 we will send out an sos weve already had offers of conkers from as far as aberdeen
2376626 we need them a specific size and shape about one and a quarter 3 2cm to one and a half inch 3 8cm diameter and fairly round
2376627 were always optimistic weve had various threats before but i must admit we are getting more apprehensive now
2376628 i cant imagine that the horse chestnut will become extinct it would be a disaster if that did happen
2376629 for example we dont yet know the total number of horse chestnut trees in britain affected by bleeding cankers
2376630 there is a limit to what can be done to combat diseases of trees
2376631 the key things are to encourage tree owners and woodland managers to practise good woodland management and tree care to ensure maximum tree health
2376632 the healthier a tree is the better it is able to withstand attacks by pests and diseases

2376639 the senior police officer came in and asked who is the english guy here and i put my hand up and he said you are free you are out of here and everyone jumped up and cheered and started to clap
2376640 there were 22 in the cell yesterday and we were jam packed but they split us up one half in one cell and one half in the other
2376641 the average number of people in the cell was 15 and i slept on the floor all the time i dont think there are beds in brazilian prisons
2376642 they said i wasnt supposed to be with real criminals but the majority of people there were hardened criminals who happened to be in for child maintenance
2376643 i was worried about my safety when i first went in you go through an initiation process when you go in when the other prisoners gather round you and they surround you in the little bathroom
2376644 after theyve scared you they laughed and said we are all fathers here we are all in for child maintenance
2376645 he was following the guidance perfectly but at 1 000ft andrew turned away from the target landing area and became slumped in his harness
2376646 he seems to think hell be able to start activity next week and go from there hell be in a splint for another week and start working out with us and start taking batting practice next week right now everything is good and well see in a week
2376647 he really believes he can play right handed right now

2376651 la respuesta del pueblo chino al terremoto nos dio a n m s confianza
2376652 the olympics shouldnt have been offered to china on the basis of their human rights record
2376653 the olympics for china is a giant spectacle a game but for us its much more than that its a chance to call attention to what is happening in tibet
2376654 its important that we show the world that we stand up for those in prison and dying
2376655 the kentucky due diligence is ongoing and is not complete
2376656 once it is we will make a final decision and file one way or the other by the end of this month
2376657 it is a tremendous facility and the market is fantastic for sports you talk about sports fans that area is in a fever over sports
2376658 if we are able to get a cup date at that facility and acquire it at a good price that would give us a very strong facility and a great anchor in what is a midwest area where we dont have a race and a unique area of the country for nascar that really hasnt been served
2376659 some people say its close to bristol but bristol is close to charlotte and charlotte is close to other facilities and atlanta is close to talladega and phoenix is close to las vegas
2376660 that is one of the potential options we would have
2376661 zero tolerance policy against discrimination and harassment in the workplace
2376662 i obviously look forward to the road courses all season and view them as our best opportunities to shine
2376663 we tested road atlanta last week and have spent the last few weeks perfecting our cars for this weekends races i feel really good about this weekend and think we have a legitimate shot of being in victory lane saturday and sunday
2376664 watkins glen could be the race weve been looking forward to and the start of something big for our team
2376665 we have probably a 1 in 5 or 1 in 10 shot of winning we put a lot of effort into our road racing effort this is something ive done for 15 years now and i have a lot of experience road racing
2376666 we still havent won with one car but this weekends race hasnt happened yet either
2376667 its important to make one car run good first and weve been able to stay inside the top 35
2376668 but wed like to position ourselves to win races a second car is going to help in that the thing is whos going to pay for it how are you going to do it and what sponsors are going to be involved in it
2376669 obviously sponsors want to be involved with a team that can win races and i look at this weekend as an opportunity of putting our team in victory lane
2376670 there have only been three teams this year in victory lane so if we could pull it off that would be big
2376671 i dont do this out of my own pocket if i had to pay a driver id probably be in trouble but because i am the driver and the owner we can do a little bit of give and take and get through like were doing now
2376672 when i hit my driver like i did today this is an easy sport
2376673 im not that aggressive if im not hitting my driver good
2376674 if im hitting bad shots with it you dont hit it as much you hit it right where youve looked whale away
2376675 if youre hitting where youre aiming it every time youre hitting good
2376676 my senior year of high school i went out and watched tiger
2376677 a lot of the players they said hit the ball really long
2376678 its just a matter of taking care of the opportunities that im given theres weeks where you can play your best and not win and theres weeks where you can kind of stumble your way in and win
2376679 unfortunately things didnt happen for me on the back nine its very difficult and this is a major
2376680 you could argue that no ones ever ready to be president i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year you could argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can ever be fully ready for the pressures of the office and that everyone learns something and something different you could argue that
2376681 i expressed my displeasure to the families that we werent able to get more prison time
2376682 this is a very serious offense and when youre attempting to abduct children its a very serious matter
2376683 even when i go shopping with my mom i feel unsafe she will be two racks away from me and i feel like someone is watching me or following me
2376684 hope deferred makes the heart sick but desire fulfilled is a tree of life

2376693 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2376694 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
2376695 this is a glorious but also huge task for anyone
2376696 i should never let the dream of all the chinese people down that was why i was nervous
2376697 every time i must balance myself in the air and hold the torch as close to the cauldron gas outlet but every time the wind blew in different directions
2376698 means china is standing side by side with the rest of the world
2376699 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china
2376700 i need someone from apple to help me with this scam i saw this app with a few friends and we jokingly clicked buy thinking it was a joke to see what would happen i called my visa card and they verified that my card was charged for 999 99
2376701 the red icon on your iphone always reminds you and others when you show it to them that you were able to afford this its a work of art with no hidden function at all

2376705 whatever is available in a particular circumstance or at a particular time
2376706 i think thrs some problem with the printer it prints the pages by the length
2376707 that was spectacular tonight the world was able to join in a magnificent tribute to the athletes and the olympic spirit it was an unforgettable and moving ceremony that celebrated the imagination originality and energy of the beijing games
2376708 it seems to me that this should be done at a time of minimum traffic
2376709 my suggestion is do this in october we are inviting these people to our town and killing them with traffic
2376710 i can sympathize with the residents that will experience the negative impact
2376711 i am not happy about it being done at night because personally i am in bed before that

2376713 blessed with four talented actresses returning for the sequel as well as a fiercely loyal fanbase the movie didnt have to do much to satisfy its audience if it had only tried a little harder though it could have been something worth recommending
2376714 its a candy coated drama coasting on a once perceptible charm thats taken a vacation for this installment youd think the sexual misadventures of four beautiful actresses would be more entertaining to watch than this presentation of storytelling lethargy
2376715 the surprising thing is its not a bad movie even if youre a guy there are some funny moments that will transcend gender and bridgets storyline is emotionally moving in a universal way since it deals with family

2376729 he said he was coming back to claim what belonged to him i guess he feels like i do im still pinching myself to make sure im not dreaming
2376730 i know hes probably doing the same thing its really a miracle for him i really cant believe it
2376731 i dont know if he feels hes betraying them for the help and support they gave him but i know they have made him feel comfortable with it
2376732 they helped him with paperwork they have verified everything themselves they said they didnt want to throw dwight to the wolves they were not going to release him until they knew everything was right for him
2376733 our football staff and compliance office have worked very hard to make his enrollment a possibility and his teammates and i look forward to welcoming dwight to chapel hill
2376734 we want to play deandre as early and often and whenever we can
2376735 weve got to get him some reps so if it comes down to him at some point hes already played some and has some experience armanti missed four and a half games last year so you never know
2376736 as a matter of fact hes ahead of where armanti was after six days his freshman year he can go in there and do it now if he had to he just needs to get his feet wet weve got three more weeks to get him a lot of reps and by the time we get to lsu hell be ready to play
2376737 hes a lot like him except that hes right handed
2376738 he can run he can throw hes got a stronger arm than armanti hes not as accurate as armanti but hes got a stronger arm hes 160 pounds right now just like when armanti got here hes a great kid too
2376739 the only thing i havent had answered yet is how tough is he taking a hit he really hasnt taken a big hit yet were going to scrimmage today and well let him get hit i want to see him get up after he gets hit hard and come back ready for the next play those are the things that armanti can do with the toughness he has well see if he has that toughness and fight in him that armanti has
2376740 hes good the last two days of practice we scrimmaged at the end and he scored both days
2376741 on one he took off on about a 60 yard run and scored when he hits the second level its over nobody is going to catch him
2376742 we obviously cant have them all in the game at the same time weve just got a lot of good players at wide receiver and running back well have to find a way the good thing about it is well keep them all fresh and if one guy gets a little winded we can go with another guy and not miss anything
2376743 thats the thing but if everybody will stay unselfish like weve been well be fine
2376744 we just dont want any of that to creep in i dont think it will weve got good kids if everybodys on the same page of winning well make it work

2376746 it is the beginning of feeling were safe in our home again
2376747 it was just like something out of the movies they were yelling demanding money and drugs
2376748 something i clearly remember is one of the men was holding a gun at dans head one of them looked at me and told me not to worry because they had families of their own i dont know how he thought that was supposed to make me feel
2376749 they were definitely looking for somebody and they didnt know us from a hole in the ground yet there they were in our house pointing guns at us
2376750 i had locked my screen door and it is harder to get a screen door open than it is to kick in a door so i heard them before they were in
2376751 he knew i had no kids and he likely knew i would have a firearm in the house and other neighbors would not so he probably thought my house was the best place to get some help said ross
2376752 they werent at my place for drugs and they wouldnt have found any
2376753 these guys were lost they didnt know who they were looking for but they were determined they could have ended up at anybodys house
2376754 it wasnt personal that they went to dans and it wasnt personal that they were at my place thats just the society we live in and when youre 30 minutes from the rcmp and people come out of town to do their dirty work it is a worry
2376755 they didnt come all this way for nothing and that makes you wonder if it could happen again
2376756 he wont remember he wont carry the fear we have
2376757 were more careful and anxious than we used to be living out here in the country weve had no dealings with drugs were just quiet people whose lives dont usually get any more exciting than watching a movie in the evening
2376758 the downfall of the bigger cars was that they were forced to stop so often so while they kept overtaking us we eventually went past them at the next petrol station when they needed to fill up again
2376759 i think the other drivers initially thought it was a hoax that a smart had entered but they gave us more and more credit as the week went on and at the end they were genuinely pleased that we won

2376807 the vtp is a fantastic concept and the technology is proven and robust we are working with some of the worlds best designers and consultants including arup rtkl wsp and faithful amp gould and our tie up with ride trade and leading leisure veteran richard pawley ex drayton manor theme park combined with pettifers development expertise gives us one of the strongest design delivery and operational teams in the world
2376808 the vtp combines some of the most successful aspects of visitor attractions in the world including observation eg london eye eiffel tower family and adrenaline rides eg walt disney alton towers and extreme activities eg macau tower all in a highly accessible city centre leisure tower the latest research proves that people are gravitating towards city centres for their leisure time linking trips such as shopping dining and other leisure activities the vtp with a relatively short dwell time of 60 90 minutes fits perfectly with this trend
2376809 the vtp is a highly profitable concept that in leading international cities will deliver annual returns for investors well in excess of 30 irr we are currently working on the first 2 3 towers initial locations include birmingham where we have earmarked a superb site and will look to make an application later this autumn and saudi arabia where we are currently in the process of finalising a local partnership deal with a prominent and highly influential member of the royal family further discussions are also taking place in relation to a second flagship tower within the gulf region
2376810 we are working with strong and highly respected institutional and private funding partners including some extremely high net worth individuals and are hoping to buck the current market trend by raising in excess of 600 million for the first wave rollout which we hope to have in place by the end of the year oil rig like building in the center of brum

2376814 thirty months ago no one was talking about youtube now its a verb
2376815 if the question is is this a big issue the answer is not yet
2376816 right now people can go on the internet to watch but not enough will because its not the same experience
2376817 people love tv and still like to get entertainment that way
2376818 we have a billion dollars worth of revenue at stake here so that means were not public television for better or worse
2376819 the one thing that we looked for was to see who was in pretty good shape and how far we have to go with that
2376820 for the most part it was pretty good but the young guys did make some mistakes but thats why we practice to fix those mistakes before our first game
2376821 we are going to find the guy thats for certain
2376822 the thing about the first day of practice is everybodys anxious and everybody is trying to do well and thats when you start rushing it and making mistakes
2376823 we are going to have a quarterback and it will come
2376824 they have the hardest job because i used to be one and i know you have to give them a little leeway on the first day especially when you have some of the younger guys not really knowing whats going on
2376825 i think it went really good for the first day i like a lot of the new receivers we have and the running backs looked strong and im loving the big offensive line we had in there
2376826 we are questionable at quarterback so all of those guys are going to have to fight for the position
2376827 theres no william hayes here to bail you out anymore
2376828 we know well be young on the defense but i like the young guys we have back
2376829 i think well build off this practice its something we have to do
2376830 with such a young team you kind of enjoy doing it this way because every practice you are hoping to get better and with every practice those young guys see the light

2376838 there are some instances that within a matter of months they could be getting additional oil in some cases it would be a matter of a year in some cases it could take longer than that depending on the location and whether you use existing rigs or you have to install new rigs but theres abundant resources in the view of the people who are in the business that could be exploited within a period of months

2376864 the olympic songs i dont feel very good about it sounds like some prostitutes are trying to attract business
2376865 but china has walked out of national crises and reached todays achievement we are going to attend the world affairs and write the history of the world together with other countries china has been reborn instead of being very careful in front of foreigners
2376866 its not easy for china to develop to this level with that big a population this is the first time weve hosted such a big world event

2376889 the united states calls for an immediate cease fire to the armed conflict in georgias region of south ossetia
2376890 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2376891 all parties georgians south ossetians and russians to de escalate the tension and avoid conflict
2376892 these attacks mark a dangerous and disproportionate escalation of tension as they occur across georgia in regions far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia
2376893 we are asking our friends and the united states among them to somehow to try to mediate and try to persuade russia to stop this military aggression and invasion of georgia
2376894 what we heard is that the state department and the entire administration is deeply concerned and that they are heavily engaged with russia trying to de escalate the situation
2376895 what is most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave

2376951 women and children are particularly vulnerable and live in precarious conditions in prisons a large number of women are detained with their children and have to give birth without an attendant physician
2376952 that is why we will not stop making sure those in power are aware of the gravity of the situation it could be a fatal blow to our countrys image
2376953 trials are not always fair people awaiting trial are not always judged according to the nature of their crime
2376954 there are more people awaiting trial than those tried in prisons they havent been tried because we dont have enough judges to try them
2376955 we need to distinguish the guilty and innocent so we do not keep innocent people in prison
2376956 we are still working with the eight courts left over from the previous justice system

2377003 we dont like word to get out next thing you know everybodyd be livin in the gutters
2377004 i think that we as a society have become desensitized to the problem of the homeless if we try to do something about it right now we still have a chance if not i see the situation getting out of control quickly
2377005 what im hoping to do is to humanize the homeless to make people realize that these arent dogs were talking about here its kind of a human interest piece but riddled with enough statistics to make people realize that we need to act now
2377006 so youre interviewin us bums tryin to make us seem like people
2377007 maybe some of us are you should talk to bernie over there by the statue and maybe the guy over there with all the birds they like talkin and they seem like they could have been people if they hadnt hit the gutter doc thomas too see im over there at the trashcan hes an educated man his wife left him for another man he just couldnt take it quit going to work quit payin rent and now he just hangs out with the park trash all day givin lectures to whoever will listen about the future of automobiles

2377015 i see i came to see you see if youre ready to be famous yet
2377016 youre wrong im just another guy who gave up on life until it gave up on him
2377017 i like the way you say things i like your perspective
2377018 that makes one of us whatd you think of doc

2377020 you get im drunk enough hell start talkin about how the japs are gonna be major contenders in the automobile industry can you imagine good thing we aint in detroit theyd probably kill him for that kind of blasphemy
2377021 not sure really i had kinda planned on just observing the lifestyle the situations you know i didnt figure anyone would really talk to me
2377022 i went down to the docks the other day and the park yesterday thats about it
2377023 i heard thats where a lot of homeless people hang out
2377024 listen you gotta stop with all this homeless stuff or save it for your paper or somethin were bums if were slouching by the train tracks you could maybe get dramatic and call us hobos homeless doesnt work heck i bet 75 of people are homeless whether they got houses or not and none of us hang out at the docks
2377025 of course not too cold especially this time of year wind comin in off the water it makes for lousy livin in the summer its too humid any other time its too cold you wanna know where we hang out i can tell you
2377026 i saw youre not getting away from me that easily
2377027 we got married i cleaned up of course got a job stopped drinkin for the most part all of that we never could have any kids but it wasnt too bad we loved each other and we had our happily ever after bad part about that is even happily ever after has to end at some point
2377028 eight months ago eight months two weeks and five days i could get into the hours and minutes but that tends to creep people out
2377029 and thats that thanks for listenin alberto youre easy to talk to like her

2377035 its unfortunate that this happened but jason is resilient and hell receive the best treatment available
2377036 the backs need to go to the ground a little bit as well as the receivers
2377037 we get lulled to sleep at practice because the defensive guys do typically back off the guys carrying the ball so they need to get tackled to the ground a little bit and see if we can hang on to the football
2377038 when we practiced for the orange bowl we werent able to tackle our backs because they were all beat up
2377039 once they started getting tackled it was hard to secure the football
2377040 one of the things well try to do is just go over and have some live competition and hopefully the offense can take care of the football and the defense can improve a little bit on their assignments
2377041 you hear coaches talk about it all the time this time of year but you really kind of want every position up for grabs
2377042 certainly some of our veteran fifth year guys youd like to think that as long as they stay healthy those positions arent up for grabs but you never know from one day to the next whos going to be healthy
2377043 so its really important for us to start to develop an idea of where our depth is
2377044 one of the real issues is weve got about five or six true freshmen who look really really good
2377045 i dont have a problem playing them if theyre the real deal and they can get 20 or 30 snaps a game
2377046 we could come out of saturdays scrimmage and get together monday in our meetings and feel like weve got to move people around
2377047 that could happen if we dont feel good about where we are
2377048 right now i think were pretty comfortable with where weve got everybody lined up but as we head to baylor weve got to get to where were pretty solid two deep
2377049 but hes a pretty resilient kid obviously hes quite disappointed himself but hes got a lot of good options out there

2377111 we know the nobu restaurant does well in london we know the english love herzliya it was obvious we should put the two together
2377112 we have to have the right mix of people and that means 70 per cent english speaking
2377113 when i worked for isrotel and bought the sanatorium that became carmel forest spa they said i was nuts
2377114 we could sell all the units to the russians in ten minutes but we wouldnt have the right buzz the success of nobu depends on creating the right atmosphere so our aim is to sell only ten per cent to the eastern bloc ten per cent to the french and ten per cent to jews from other countries
2377115 we sold the first 20 units we released even before we launched the project in may
2377116 its a great deal instead of paying 500 000 for a flat in tel aviv brits can buy a suite on the beach in israels st tropez stay in it for up to 90 days and benefit from rental income the rest of the year and all the capital growth
2377117 he sat in on every design meeting i was staggered by the detail he went into
2377118 it was while we were enjoying the hot tubs that we came up with the concept of creating places where people could stay as well as eat nobu style
2377119 if armani and bulgari can expand their non hospitality brands into successful hotels why not a restaurant
2377120 well get a nuts and bolts hotel guy in who knows all about how to do it then have him drink the nobu kool aid
2377121 they met chef nobu two years ago at a childrens hospital benefit and it all started there
2377122 it was like dating it leads to the first kiss and the hand under the sweater and suddenly youre engaged
2377123 they totally get what we call dinertainment going out for dinner for more than food
2377124 israel is booming you cant get a room in tel aviv and there isnt a proper boutique hotel in the country

2377131 but to be honest with you i have done a bunch of interviews and they are like were you nervous to throw the ball or let it loose and i was like no because ive had no setbacks i didnt try to rush it when we started throwing nobody was around it wasnt like it was april and guys are working out or may and we have minicamp and im trying to push it i didnt have to push it because nobody was there so that worked in my favor and we didnt have any setbacks the arm felt too good your body knows when you feel something and i didnt feel any pain anywhere so that was nice
2377132 im not looking at it any different than any other first preseason game
2377133 you like to go out there and be productive and see what happens i dont have any clue how long i will play i think so many guys who are coming back from an injury they want to get out there but i dont feel that way ive been practicing i have no apprehension at all i dont know if im being naive but i dont feel that way at all
2377134 when i would sleep i would leave my arm straight at night waking up in the morning washing my face brushing my teeth little things like that we shot it up with cortisone late in the season before we played the saints in baton rouge and it was like total relief it lasted through the rest of the season and through the playoffs and the pro bowl and the offseason it didnt bother me because i wasnt throwing a whole lot but in the 06 training camp my forearm started bothering me everything was starting to and then i started to have pain in the back of the elbow that is when we had a bone spur and things went from there
2377135 that week leading up to it it just wasnt right
2377136 i remember vividly talking to my wife on a friday afternoon and she had to fly back from a funeral for my grandmother and she said how was practice and how is the arm and i said it was miserable this week it was just miserable this week and then it went your body just tells you sometimes
2377137 im not just saying that it feels great it really truly does feel great
2377138 even though it wasnt the best timing with it being the end of summer here we think its the best way to make use of the negative turning it into a positive
2377139 if the whole world does not stop russia today then russian tanks will be able to reach any other european capital

2377141 the entire town of tkshinvali is currently controlled by units of south ossetias self defence
2377142 he is in big danger of losing the cachet he built up for himself in being pro western and the restraint he has often shown in the face of provocation by russia
2377143 what russia is doing in georgia is open unhidden aggression and a challenge to the whole world
2377144 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2377145 the only possible way out is the withdrawal of georgian forces to starting positions

2377216 its not going to be a quick fix in nova scotia
2377217 we will reach our targets and then we will advance even stronger targets following the 2020 level
2377218 a cap on emissions is needed for nova scotia to hit its legislated ghg reduction target seeing ontario and quebec moving forward presents an important opportunity for nova scotia to join with provinces that are taking climate action

2377235 denying texas request is a mistake that will only increase the already heavy financial burden on families while doing even more harm to the livestock industry
2377236 good intentions and laudable goals are small compensation to the families farmers and ranchers who are being hurt by the federal governments efforts to trade food for fuel any government mandate that artificially props up a single industry to the detriment of millions of americans is bad public policy
2377237 if even five percent of biofuels are sourced from wiping out existing ancient forests youve lost all your carbon gain
2377238 even on optimistic estimates producing a gallon of ethanol from corn uses most of the energy the gallon contains
2377239 america should be focusing on viable clean energy solutions like conservation solar and wind instead the misguided corn ethanol mandate is forcing farmers to plow up marginal land and wildlife habitat while increasing global warming and dumping toxic fertilizers and pesticides into our precious water sources

2377245 the company directors have made several statements and suggestions for a resolution for outstanding orders none of which hsbc considers appropriate or practical
2377246 this is a complex situation and we are working with kpmg the administrator to get a clearer understanding of the companys financial situation and agree a way forward but the company has only been in administration for 24 hours and this will take some time
2377247 worketh all things after the counsel of his own will
2377248 thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power
2377249 is it not lawful for me to do what i will with mine own
2377250 but for the elects sake whom he has chosen he has shortened the days
2377251 ye have not chosen me but i have chosen you
2377252 but the lord said unto him go thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto me
2377253 and he said the god of our fathers hath chosen thee
2377254 not to all people but unto witnesses chosen before of god even to us
2377255 but god hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and god has chosen the weak things of the world
2377256 but we are bound to give thanks always to god for you brethren beloved of the lord because god hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation
2377257 according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world read the whole chapter
2377258 but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood an holy nation a peculiar or purchased people
2377259 and they that are with him are called and chosen and faithful
2377260 blessed is the nation whose god is the lord and the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance
2377261 i speak not of you all i know whom i have chosen
2377262 for thou art an holy people unto the lord thy god the lord thy god hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all people that are upon the face of the earth
2377263 to determine in favor of to designate choose or select as an object of mercy or favor predestinated in the divine councils one chosen or set apart one chosen or designated by god for salvation collectively the saved
2377264 this election is an act of distinguishing love of divine sovereignty eternal absolute and irrevocable personal
2377265 and he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds
2377266 who shall lay anything to the charge of gods elect
2377267 paul a servant of god and an apostle of jesus christ according to the faith of gods elect
2377268 for jacob my servants sake and israel mine elect i have even called thee by thy name i have surnamed thee though thou hast not known me
2377269 and i will bring forth a seed out of jacob and out of judah an inheritor of my mountains and mine elect shall inherit and my servants shall dwell there
2377270 for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of god according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth
2377271 even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace
2377272 wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure
2377273 but as touching the election they are beloved for the fathers sake
2377274 among whom are ye also the called of jesus christ
2377275 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose
2377276 but unto them which are called both jews and greeks christ the power of god and the wisdom of god
2377277 fight the good fight of faith lay hold on eternal life whereunto thou art also called
2377278 but when it pleased god who separated me from my mothers womb and called me by his grace to reveal his son in me
2377279 but the god of all grace who hath called us unto his eternal glory by jesus christ
2377280 for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are afar off even as many as the lord our god shall call
2377281 that ye would walk worthy of god who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory
2377282 they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance
2377283 there is one body and one spirit even as ye are called in one hope of your calling
2377284 wherefore also we pray always for you that our god would count you worthy of this calling
2377285 to fix to settle to establish or fix by decree or decision
2377286 and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient whereunto also they were appointed
2377287 for god hath not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our lord jesus christ
2377288 seeing his days are determined the number of his months are with thee thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass
2377289 open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction
2377290 thus saith the lord because thou hast let go out of thy hand a man whom i appointed to utter destruction
2377291 for there are certain men crept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation
2377292 and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed
2377293 for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them
2377294 art thou not from everlasting o lord my god mine holy one we shall not die o lord thou hast ordained them for judgment and o mighty god thou has established them for correction
2377295 for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called
2377296 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will
2377297 in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will
2377298 all that the father giveth me shall come to me
2377299 no man can come to me except the father which hath sent me draw him
2377300 a man can receive nothing except it be given him from heaven
2377301 but ye believe not because ye are not of my sheep
2377302 and other sheep i have which are not of this fold them also i must bring and they shall hear my voice christ had a definite work to do and thus a definite number to die for
2377303 for i am with thee and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee for i have much people in this city
2377304 and not for that nation only but that also he should gather together in one the children of god that were scattered abroad
2377305 i have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world
2377306 as thou hast given him power over all flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him
2377307 before i formed thee in the belly i knew thee
2377308 now we brethren as isaac was are the children of promise
2377309 therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed
2377310 when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed
2377311 supreme in power independent of and unlimited by any other
2377312 what if god willing to show his wrath and to make his power known endured with much long suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction
2377313 as it is written jacob have i loved but esau have i hated
2377314 hath not the potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honor and another unto dishonor
2377315 but now o lord thou art our father we are the clay and thou our potter and we all are the work of thy hand
2377316 woe unto him that striveth with his maker shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it what maketh thou or thy work he hath no hands
2377317 even every one that is called by my name for i have created him for my glory i have formed him yea i have made him
2377318 i form the light and create darkness i make peace and create evil i the lord do all these things
2377319 i have made the earth the man and the beast that are upon the ground by my great power and by my outstretched arm and have given it unto whom it seemed meet unto me
2377320 know ye that the lord he is god it is he that has made us and not we ourselves
2377321 the counsel of the lord standeth forever the thoughts of his heart to all generation
2377322 according as it is written god hath given them the spirit of slumber eyes that they should not see and ears that they should not hear unto this day
2377323 i thank thee o father lord of heaven and earth because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them unto babes
2377324 neither knoweth any man the father save the son and he to whomsoever the son will reveal him
2377325 and jesus said for judgment i am come into this world that they which see not might see and that they which see might be made blind
2377326 therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy and whom he will he hardeneth
2377327 the lord hath made all things for himself yea even the wicked for the day of evil
2377328 and that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy which he had afore prepared unto glory even us whom he has called
2377329 who then can be saved with men this is impossible but with god all things are possible
2377330 so then it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth but of god that sheweth mercy
2377331 but he answered and said every plant which my heavenly father hath not planted shall be rooted up
2377332 but these as natural brute beasts made to be taken and destroyed
2377333 and for this cause god shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie that they all might be damned
2377334 i know that whatsoever god doeth it shall be forever nothing can be put to it nor anything taken from it and god doeth it that men should fear before him
2377335 and again behold i and the children which god hath given me
2377336 for unto you it is given in the behalf of christ not only to believe on him but also to suffer for his sake
2377337 giving thanks unto the father which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light
2377338 for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things in bringing many sons unto glory
2377339 wherein god willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel
2377340 according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in christ jesus our lord
2377341 nay but o man who art thou that repliest against god shall the thing formed say to him that formed it why hast thou made me thus
2377342 for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god
2377343 but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my father
2377344 for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven
2377345 who then can be saved and jesus looking upon them saith with men it is impossible but not with god for with god all things are possible
2377346 every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the father of lights with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning
2377347 the lord of hosts hath sworn saying surely as i have thought so shall it come to pass and as i have purposed so shall it stand
2377348 this people have i formed for myself verses 1 13 chap 8 18
2377349 thus saith the lord thy redeemer and he that formed thee from the womb i am the lord that maketh all things
2377350 the will is that faculty of the soul whereby we freely choose or refuse things it is of the nature of the will to do freely whatsoever it wills but it is unable till it be changed by grace to move itself towards god and to will what is good is of grace our will being free in respect of sinful acts but bound in respect of good works till it be made free by christ
2377351 that doctrine therefore which teaches that when grace is offered we may refuse it if we will and if we will we may receive it is to be looked upon as contrary to the scriptures we all acknowledge dark sayings in scripture and things hard to be understood but the difficulty is not so much from the word as from a natural unbelief prejudice and darkness within which are those crooked wrinkled or discolored mediums men commonly look through at spiritual things the doctrine of general love will not stand with that of special election yet the doctrine of special election will stand without that and against it for there is nothing more plain than that there is an election of men to salvation as also the genuine import of election is to choose one or more out of many which necessarily implies the leaving or not choosing of some and consequently the not willing of salvation to all universally the will of god cannot be resisted successfully because with his willing the end he also wills the means my counsel shall stand i will do all my pleasure it shows what reason we have to discard forever that groundless and blind opinion which lays the stress of salvation on a thing of naught for what else is the will of a frail and mutable man the grace of god is little beholden to that doctrine which would give the glory of it to a graceless thing man one god was the maker of all but all were not made for the same use and end as in a great house are many vessels some to honor and some to dishonor so in the word we have some god raised up to be monuments of his power and justice exod 9 16 jude 4 1 peter 2 8 called therefore vessels of wrath rom 9 22 others are vessels of mercy whom he formed for himself isa 43 7 21 and are therefore said to be afore prepared unto glory rom 9 23 the principle thing intended and merited by the death of christ was the justification of sinners and that god might be just in justifying of them rom 3 23 and finally that they might have eternal life john 17 2 if therefore he merited this for all then all must be justified and saved rom 5 8 9 10 and it cannot be justly denied to any for it is their due by virtue of price for none can be condemned for whom christ died rom 8 34 therefore if christ died for all then all must be justified and saved and it must be concluded that all are not justified so consequently christ did not give himself for all to say that christ died for all without exception and yet admitting that only a few are saved would seem to tax god of injustice or else that the sufferings of christ were not sufficient to make a discharge due to them or it insinuates a deficiency of power or want of good will to prosecute his design to perfection that election is founded upon grace or the good pleasure of gods will is the only original cause and motive of election
2377352 declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times the things that are not yet done saying my counsel shall stand and i will do all my pleasure
2377353 and all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth and none can stay his hand or say unto him what doest thou
2377354 which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god
2377355 of his own will begat he us with the word of truth
2377356 for the scripture saith unto pharaoh even for this same purpose have i raised thee up that i might shew my power in thee and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth
2377357 and in very deed for this cause have i raised thee up for to shew in thee my power and that my name be declared throughout all the earth
2377358 and the lord said unto moses go in unto pharaoh for i have hardened his heart
2377359 for it was of the lord to harden their hearts
2377360 now go and smite amalek and utterly destroy all that they have and spare them not but slay both man and woman infant and suckling
2377361 jesus answered and said unto him verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born again or from above he cannot see the kingdom of god
2377362 for if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature and wert grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree
2377363 and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins
2377364 who hath directed the spirit of the lord or being his counselor hath taught him
2377365 the grass withereth the flower fadeth but the word of our god shall stand for ever
2377366 there are many devices in a mans heart nevertheless the counsel of the lord that shall stand
2377367 but he said yea rather blessed are they that hear the word of god and keep it
2377368 for a man can receive nothing except it be given him from heaven
2377369 nay but o man who are thou that repliest against god
2377370 be not rash with thy mouth and let not thine heart be hasty to utter anything before god
2377371 whom shall he teach knowledge and whom shall he make to understand doctrine them that are weaned from the milk drawn from the breasts
2377372 holy holy holy is the lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory
2377373 it is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in
2377374 whatsoever god doeth it shall be forever nothing can be put to it nor anything taken from it and god doeth it that men should fear before him

2377413 the house stood with us again and again voting our way on five separate votes on this bill over the last couple years
2377414 the senate has long been the more challenging chamber for us but even though the senate failed to do the right thing and pass the bill we found strong new allies and are poised for progress in 2009
2377415 the bill would elevate sexual orientation and gender identity or expression to the same level with the enumerations of race color ancestry national origin gender physical appearance mental physical or sensory disability all immutable or unchangeable characteristics
2377416 yet homosexuality bisexuality transgender cross dressing and other alternate sexual behaviors are not immutable but changeable it would be most egregious to affirm by state law that what is unnatural behavior is somehow unchangeably innate and normal
2377417 in the end we had the votes for passage in both chambers if everyone was there but absences in the senate hurt our numbers
2377418 neither chamber took up the bill knowing they lacked the votes for passage in the senate

2377423 hear another parable there was a householder who planted a vineyard and set a hedge around it and dug a wine press in it and built a tower and let it out to tenants and went into another country when the season of fruit drew near he sent his servants to the tenants to get his fruit and the tenants took his servants and beat one killed another and stoned another again he sent other servants more than the first and they did the same to them afterward he sent his son to them saying they will respect my son but when the tenants saw the son they said to themselves this is the heir come let us kill him and have his inheritance and they took him and cast him out of the vineyard and killed him when therefore the owner of the vineyard comes what will he do to those tenants
2377424 he will put those wretches to a miserable death and let out the vineyard to other tenants who will give him the fruits in their seasons

2377429 in the aftermath of world war ii jews are least afraid of the spectre of eugenics
2377430 there is a difference between state policy and individual behaviour
2377431 antisemitism is the best analogy its a bad thing but while you have the right to be an antisemite as an individual you dont have the right to be an antisemitic state thats fascism
2377432 as an individual you have the right to make stupid or amoral decisions about the way you conceive select or raise your children as long as it is not raised to be state policy
2377433 it already functions like a database they just insert a new field
2377434 it will always sound quite bizarre to say i was in love with a guy but broke up because we were both tay sachs carriers but it will become increasingly reasonable to say i married him then decided to have children through ivf
2377435 at the moment people have ivf and test as a result that process will become turned around with people having ivf because they want the testing
2377436 because the practice is getting so far ahead of the conversation
2377437 we have started speaking of genes that determine behaviour personality traits and even lifestyle preferences before we have had a chance to learn what these genes might be
2377438 studies seem to show that women who are aware of family history but decide not to take the test suffer from anxiety more than others
2377439 when i was tested there was a lack of accessible information and support networks but even in four years this has changed massively
2377440 all i could do was reduce the amount of knowledge that drove me crazy in my mangled internal math the 40 per cent risk of ovarian cancer was knowledge i could live with and the 87 per cent risk of breast cancer was not
2377441 if the only part of your body thats subjected to a real workout every day is your brain it might be time to consider strategies for getting the rest of you moving

2377445 los minutos se van adquiriendo en la medida en la que el entrenador lo considera oportuno hay mucha competencia y todos quieren jugar y tener minutos pero hay que tener tranquilidad tomarse las cosas con calma saber esperar y aguardar a que llegue el momento oportuno ahora sobre todo se trata de adquirir mucho ritmo

2377452 estamos a favor de que exista una regulaci n sobre las personas que se sientan y duermen en los soportales de las comercios
2377453 yo no estoy a favor de estas medidas pero tampoco de la beneficiencia cl sica de la limosna de toda la vida lo importante es llegar a las causas conocer por qu estas personas est n en la calle e intentar darles una soluci n a sus problemas
2377454 no todo es malo si el objetivo es ayudarles a mejorar su situaci n ser algo positivo
2377455 lo importante es combatir las mafias que est n detr s de la mendicidad sin vulnerar el derecho a pedir ayuda

2377460 la mayor a de las bajas se han producido por la crisis de la construcci n porque hay muchos aut nomos en el sector y las promotoras a los primeros que despiden es a los profesionales subcontratados
2377461 si despiden a un trabajador de plantilla tienen problemas como pagar las indemnizaciones pero con un aut nomo subcontratado simplemente cuando acaban el trabajo que est n haciendo no los vuelven a contratar
2377462 hay muchos aut nomos en el sector y no hay visos de que la crisis se vaya a acabar

2377488 the banks have to back track through all of the transactions because the compromise happened a couple of months ago this could have been a major incident if it had not been noticed and the cards blocked
2377489 the chances are that its just one retailer it could have been a disgruntled staff member who stole the details and then waited a few months to use them generally retailers here are above board you usually find that the owner or the manager knows nothing about it and its a staff member who only worked there for a couple of weeks
2377490 it is also a good opportunity to raise awareness among retailers that they should make sure they are complying with security standards and to update them if necessary
2377491 if we had a mandatory system of reporting then a couple of months ago when this information was stolen these 100 customers could have been informed and could have been monitoring their credit card accounts

2377557 who spent most of their professional lives developing and implementing methods to make national accounts comparable across countries particularly but not exclusively by putting them on a purchasing power parity basis the result of this lifetime effort was the publication of the penn world tables in 1991
2377558 to set up and solve a rather opaque set of many equations in many unknowns
2377559 economists and policymakers used to think poor countries were poor because they invest too little whether in physical capital or in their people and as a result at any point in time they have too little capital
2377560 what the penn world tables allowed chad jones and others to do is to check these assumptions against the data and to find that they were completely wrong the problem of poor countries is not that they have too little resources to produce but that they use these resources very badly what they need is not more investment or more schooling they need to become more efficient
2377561 in the same way that in medicine getting the right diagnosis for a sick patient improves his life relative to having the wrong diagnosis different diagnosis implies different therapy

2377567 as director of scprt i take full responsibility for the organizational failure that allowed one employee to approve this third party promotion without it undergoing the same scrutiny and review that all scprt ads undergo
2377568 we have made internal changes to ensure this doesnt happen again
2377569 for those skeptics who imply that the amro promotion was a strategic decision made by scprt at the policy level i invite them to review all of the documents correspondence and e mails made public this week by scprt this paper trail clearly demonstrates that the employee in question acted on his own without the knowledge of even his direct supervisor
2377570 i am disappointed that both prt and officials within the governors office had some knowledge of the so gay campaign prior to news coverage and thought it was appropriate to ever consider using tax dollars to promote the homosexual lifestyle
2377571 and i am disappointed that a low level state employee was a made a scapegoat

2377581 es una opci n por la que optan los comerciantes para intentar salvar estos meses y que el desastre econ mico sea un poco menor de lo esperado
2377582 aunque parezca incre ble hay mucha gente que a estas alturas prefiere comprarse ropa de invierno en vez de restos de la de verano
2377583 unas rebajas desastrosas con las ventas m s bajas desde hace a os
2377584 no quisimos hacer previsiones a la espera de c mo estuviera el tiempo asegura amor e incluso puede pasar que mejore en septiembre cuando ya d igual porque la temporada de rebajas se ha acabado
2377585 hay comercios que todav a tienen a la venta m s del 50 de los productos que rebajaron
2377586 esper bamos una poca desastrosa con ventas much simo menores pienso que parte de los malos resultados se deben a la psicosis que se est creando entre la poblaci n de que la situaci n econ mica es muy mala porque aunque no hay ventas en los comercios en las terrazas de las calle peatonal de ngel senra hay ambiente y gente tomando tapas y cervezas

2377701 all of us have gotten it down to a routine schedule were working on getting things done quicker you know like hair and makeup because there are five girls and four of the girls are in the first set so its hard to get everybody done but were doing really well
2377702 backstage i freak out a little bit when i look into the audience i go second so when chikezie is out there i peek through the little cracks and see how many people are out there i kinda freak out a little because there are so many people then you go out there and you do the same songs every night you dont have to learn new words or impress anybody youre just being yourself putting yourself out there for the people who have been watching you and supporting you

2377727 obama wins demo nomination a black flag for white america
2377728 will be a clear signal for millions of our people
2377729 obama is a visual aid for white americans who just dont get it yet that we have lost control of our country and unless we get it back we are heading for complete annihilation as a people
2377730 instead of this so called civil rights bill for example that says you have to give preferences to minorities i think the american people are going once they see the obamanation theyre going to demand a tweaking of that and say you have to put the majority into office
2377731 nationalists had to break through the news media barrier in order to be a social reform magnet and we have succeeded
2377732 obamas election could prompt more whites to get involved in politics
2377733 those were the good old days for straight white males

2377766 a principal advantage of linspire its codec licensing agreement with microsoft no longer applies
2377767 with the linspire acquisition we had three desktop brands and two distinct code bases from joint discussions with our respective engineering teams it made eminent sense to combine our efforts with a single code base and two brands
2377768 freespire is returning to debian because we need to build all of our desktop products upon a single code base
2377769 xandros has always worked closely with the debian community where the emphasis is stability and consistency over the bleeding edge besides its not that big a switch since ubuntu is based on debian as well

2377775 a recent history of writing and drawing is an exhibition that explores the evolving relationship between technologies of communication and their users it is a project by the programmer designer j rg lehni and the graphic designer alex rich curated by design historian emily king and involves a variety of interactive and non interactive devices for writing and drawing the centrepiece of the exhibition is viktor a large wall drawing machine that is controlled by an adapted version of ordinary design software and powered by small industrial motors on thursday evenings the gallery will host a variety of speakers including designers artists and musicians who are themselves known for using technologies in more or less orthodox ways during these events viktor will trace accompanying material on the gallery wall the image remaining in place for the following week other exhibits include a machine for creating hole punched posters and a specially adapted handheld printer and all of the works will allow visitors to explore the relationship between technology and expression moving away from the blunt duality of man vs machine it is now possible to appreciate the particular qualities of various forms of mechanical and digital mark making technologies can be enjoyed for their poetry and exploited for their spare capacity their ability to undertake tasks not foreseen by their makers lehni the creator of viktor is interested in the nature of tools and reworks technologies to suit his own needs often defying the apparent closure of proprietary software after seeing one of lehnis drawing machines at work rich a deft observer of accidental meaning opened a discussion with the designer about the machines historical and cultural context since this time the pair have had an ongoing exchange about the tools of communication and the potential of customised and corralled technology
2377776 were selling as many as 2 000 or 3 000 units per week today of blu ray devices and that basically builds our customer base and our loyalty because once someone buys the blu ray device we think were the best location for them to return and either rent or buy their blu ray products
2377777 we are seeing more momentum behind blu ray as hdtv penetration continues to grow
2377778 it should be a strong holiday for the format theres no more competition from hd dvd theres no more consumer confusion and more content is becoming available on blu ray even sales of up converting dvd players that are competitive with blu ray are good for the format because it shows consumers are willing to invest more in output

2377808 she was arrested by afghan police for acting suspiciously outside the governors compound in the central afghan province of ghazni on july 17 they said that ms siddiqui was with a teenage boy at the time
2377809 the warrant officer saw and heard siddiqui fire at least two shots as interpreter 1 tried to wrestle the gun from her no one was hit
2377810 siddiqui is said to have first been apprehended in afghanistan with a bag full of suspicious liquids in glass containers but whether the liquids were dangerous is not stated in the alleged struggle at a police station prosecutors indicate they do not know how many rounds siddiqui allegedly fired or even how many bullets struck her

2377822 described by many as the mother teresa of burma and learned how doctors there treat thousands of poor burmese for cataracts missing legs and other problems
2377823 twenty years have gone by everything is still the same or maybe worse in burma
2377824 we know that burma is a very rich country rich in natural resources and the junta uses those resources to prop themselves up for their own benefit not for the benefit of the people of burma
2377825 as you know the chinese depend on a lot of energy imports into china we urge the chinese to do what other countries have done to sanction to put a financial squeeze on the burmese generals the best solution would be if general than shwes regime would start real dialogue
2377826 thousands of heavily armed burmese security forces have been moved to the outskirts of rangoon days before the twentieth anniversary of an uprising which came close to bringing down the military regime
2377827 they are keeping large numbers of security personnel inside the city out of sight if they see a single protester in the street he will be picked up in minutes

2377830 these gave the lie to the governments claim that the disaster was under control and added to anger at its refusal to allow foreign emergency workers into the delta

2377836 but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups you could actually save just as much
2377837 theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption
2377838 efficiency experts say that keeping tires inflated can improve gas mileage 3 percent and regular maintenance can add another 4 percent many drivers already follow their advice but if everyone did we could immediately reduce demand several percentage points in other words obama is right
2377839 if our use of fossil fuels is increasing our reliance on middle eastern dictators while destroying the planet maybe we ought to use less
2377840 we can use those twisty carbon fluorescent light bulbs we can unplug our televisions computers and phone chargers when were not using them
2377841 its sad to see mccains campaign adopting the politics of the tire gauge promoting the fallacy that americans are powerless to address their own energy problems because the truth is yes we can

2377851 drugs can be sewn into suitcases strapped to peoples bodies or concealed internally hidden in shoes bag handles in hollowed out religious books or in book spines and covers
2377852 weve even found them in childrens toys you see a child walking through clutching a teddy bear and you wouldnt think it contained drugs but its something weve found
2377853 sometimes we just find blocks of drugs in a suitcase
2377854 we have teams of officers and dogs in the passenger terminals checking luggage and people and also in the air freight sheds
2377855 they are very experienced and they know what theyre dealing with
2377856 once the dogs pick up the scent theyre trained to smell for cash and animal derived products as well the officers will check and x ray the goods
2377857 were looking for illegal drugs excise goods such as cigarettes meat and diary product from non eu countries weapons and pornography
2377858 we make seizures every day but not necessarily of drugs id say we make regular drugs seizures but couldnt go any further than that some weeks theyll be two or three others none at all
2377859 the full impact is still not clear and that is why we have asked for a more detailed report the situation is a moveable feast as after going up tremendously fuel costs have shown some indication of settling down at this stage it is too early to say whether we would require extra money from taxpayers
2377860 every year we budget for possible inflationary increases for pay and non pay costs as each year progresses these estimates are closely monitored and revised in line with the emerging picture
2377861 recent increases in petrol and diesel costs have required us to re calculate what we are likely to spend on motor fuel in the current financial year
2377862 using current prices we initially estimate we may have to spend an extra 1m for petrol and diesel for the 2008 09 financial year above our original calculations and are now working to produce a more detailed estimate
2377863 last year we spent 636 000 on diesel which all of our vehicles use so far for the current financial year we have budgeted to spend an extra 159 000 a 25 per cent increase based on current prices
2377864 but the situation is being monitored weekly because of the fluctuating nature of fuel prices
2377865 the rising cost of fuel is undoubtedly a cost pressure on the service and it is purchased in the most cost effective manner
2377866 every year the trust sets a reserve with regards to what is expected within its budget the trust manages its financial situation based around what cost pressures are prevailing at the time and takes inflation into consideration
2377867 the budget for fuel for this financial year has been increased by 1 2m raising the budget for the whole of the north west to 5 6m
2377868 the increase in fuel costs is monitored on a monthly basis and this figure could change once again

2377871 enterprises need to have a presence on the web and they want to be relevant
2377872 but stories like this signal the need for sites like facebook and myspace to filter and be more proactive
2377873 this happens every time some cool new technology comes along that attracts a lot of users
2377874 weve seen it with e mail and instant messaging their popularity makes them a become a big target for the bad guys
2377875 the more reports we get the easier it is to respond decisively

2377887 were not rich and it was money we probably didnt have but we all had to be there

2377889 everything seemed to be above board and we were told that wed get the tickets two weeks before departure date
2377890 eventually we spoke to air france and klm who we thought we were travelling with they said the seats had been held but they had never been issued and so the booking had expired and was worthless
2377891 we cant really afford to go and the prices are really high
2377892 the btcb didnt want to cause the lads out there any un necessary stress so they stepped in and sorted new tickets for us all to go out there the lads expect us to be there watching them and no one wants their performances to be affected by our absence
2377893 we are really grateful for their help because without this we would not be going but we will still have to bear the financial burden when we get home
2377894 they have other branches but weve tried them and there is no answer
2377895 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2377896 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2377897 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2377898 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2377934 we are the most unique casino in the country were in a building that built in the early 1900s
2377935 i think its great did you see how beautiful the building is
2377936 we think its somewhat irresponsible to be opening this casino when there are questions that are still pending on the legality of the gambling operation
2377937 its been very frustrating we feel like weve always followed the rules and we were the only ones doing that it was very satisfying
2377938 its a great investment a very big investment its very exciting it adds excitement to our downtown i think it fits a piece of the puzzle of us working on downtown revitalization
2377939 im gonna enjoy this and see where it takes me
2377940 it all started with a conversation in a pub i was chatting to a pal about the first world war and it got on to the fact that i didnt even know my great grandfathers name
2377941 the initial part of research was quite easy with modern computer records but then it started to get a bit more difficult
2377942 i made extensive use of the internet however and managed to hit on family trees that other branches of the family had already researched which finally led me to make contact with relatives in the states
2377943 apparently three of his sons later made the journey to america to join him but when in 1853 william was on his way to salt lake city to meet them he was ambushed and killed by indians as they camped for the night
2377944 it seems that there had been something of a war going on between settlers and local indians and that he set out with three companions against all good advice
2377945 the location of his grave remains unknown but in 2006 a memorial was laid to his memory in his adopted city and william is also honoured as a utah pioneer in a memorial in manti
2377946 after his death williams three sons inherited whatever he had settled there and began families and their descendants are living in and around utah to this day
2377947 it was a tragic story not least because old letters unearthed in a trunk revealed that williams wife though clearly keen to see her children do well had been very fearful about her husband sailing to america
2377948 a year earlier one of her own brothers had died of cholera making the trip across the atlantic and later when two more decided to emigrate to new zealand another died of the same disease
2377949 i travelled out to utah two years ago and met up with a bunch of relatives
2377950 its more about spending your time here acting on what you believe than it is trying to figure out who you are

2377957 i am getting on a bit now but i still get out there and tend to the shrubs and flowers
2377958 my garden is definitely not messy and this whole thing has been a big mistake
2377959 i garden every day when it is nice and always pick the weeds up
2377960 i saw him through the office window and went out i pointed out there werent any double yellows there he said somebody would be coming along to paint them back and he basically accused me of being the one who had painted them out then he just gave me the ticket anyway
2377961 i had done no such thing to be honest i thought the council had done it because i dont think it is council land
2377962 ive heard of other people in our building who say theyve had tickets for parking in that space which were quashed because its not council land
2377963 it is apparent that a small section of double yellow lines on tivoli st have been deliberately obscured with a view to avoiding the obvious parking restrictions in place
2377964 if a motorist in receipt of a parking ticket considers that it should not be paid they should appeal following the instructions on the reverse of the parking ticket
2377965 it is a private street but we have been asked by the landlord to enforce parking regulations

2378041 at the present time approximately one out of six members of wake forest baptist church is gay or lesbian
2378042 we could not justify continuing to support in a major way major for our congregation an organization that on principle would discriminate against 15 of the members of our church on the basis of their sexuality
2378043 i have not attended a meeting of the cbf since the policy was approved
2378044 the desire to appeal to the broad middle of the moderate movement that has been present since the beginning of the cbf is not one that our congregation has chosen to embrace nor is it one i have chosen to embrace in my own ministry
2378045 i understand and appreciate where you and wake forest baptist church differ with our funding and hiring policy regarding homosexuals
2378046 this is an issue where baptists have differences of conscience and convictions i respect the protest of your congregation just as i respect the fellowships decision to implement this policy
2378047 i treasure your friendship and thank god for your ministry
2378048 something theyve known has been a probelm for a long time
2378049 cbf does not have the same kind of organizational structure as the southern baptist convention
2378050 it really is more of a netowrk that connects congregations rather than a denominational set up
2378051 it is important for congregations to work together even if they dont agree with everything otherwise you stay so polarized that nothing can get done that is one of the problems with our political system right now that just ends up with nothing getting done
2378052 the policy strictly relates to cbf organizations and cbf the corporation if you will
2378053 the hiring policy is not an official position and not in any way something enforced on individuals or churches in the fellowship
2378054 we feel like it is our baptist principles that prevent us from making a stronger statement on the issue
2378055 it is a difficult document from that standpoint it is certainly not a litmus test for membership in the cbf
2378056 make the worship of god primary in all our gatherings create places of refuge and renewal for those who are wounded or ignored by the church side with those who are poor pursue justice with and for those who are oppressed and hold ourselves accountable for equity collegiality and diversity
2378057 organizational policy on homosexual behavior related to personnel and funding
2378058 as baptist christians we believe that the foundation of a christian sexual ethic is faithfulness in marriage between a man and a woman and celibacy in singleness
2378059 because of this organizational value the cooperative baptist fellowship does not allow for the expenditure of funds for organizations or causes that condone advocate or affirm homosexual practice neither does this cbf organizational value allow for the purposeful hiring of a staff person or the sending of a missionary who is a practicing homosexual
2378060 we feel like it is our baptist principles that prevent us from making a stronger statement on the issue
2378061 it is a difficult document fromm that standpoint it is certainly not a litmus test for membership in the cbf
2378062 the freedom and responsibility of every person to relate directly to god without the imposition of creed or the control of clergy or government

2378084 your master has spoken very highly of you he is very pleased with your work here so i came here to ponder at how such an outstanding young gentleman such as yourself came into the employment of mister wilson
2378085 it is quite a long story maam i am sure you do not wish to spend your morning listening would you like me to wrap your purchases for you or is there anything else you wish to look at
2378086 mister thomas my only reason for coming here so early was to extract that story from you you needed wrap my selections if you refuse to tell me
2378087 alright maam i will tell you but please forgive me if we are interrupted by other patrons during the course of the tale
2378088 that is not a problem and so i do not feel any guilt about wasting so much of your work time i will match the amount of sales you make while you story goes on
2378089 may i find you a chair to sit in while i talk maam
2378090 that would be most lovely and please call me elizabeth
2378091 ah now that is a tale by itself my father was an infamous pirate that only attacked spanish ships
2378092 why only spanish ships you ask it goes along with why they call him odd james crazy most of the people who knew him never dared to ask but my mother has told me the tale when he was a young lad a spanish man came and robbed his daddys cargo once when he made port his dad was killed because he couldnt pay back the merchants for their loses when he attacked spanish ships it was his revenge for the fate of his father
2378093 my thomas sitting down on the job this is not what i house you for
2378094 edward please i practically forced him his loyalty was very endearing
2378095 mister wilson if she has ever previously conversed with you as she claims she has she knows that all you do is tease
2378096 very true edward you do not give me enough credit for knowing your character
2378097 in that case it is very nice to see you here today has he helped you find what you sought
2378098 mister wilson may i speak to you privately for a moment
2378099 she has just turned our lives around more extra money than you could ever dream of
2378100 for every item we sell while i tell her my lifes tale she has promised to purchase an item to match if you would look at the ribbons she has already selected you knows what this mean
2378101 no sir i speak the truth will you tend the store while i speak to her
2378102 no thomas i do not think i will let you have the day off to sit around and chat
2378103 the longer it takes for you to finish the more shall get her to buy every time you must leave her it will only add to her guilt it will work out perfectly
2378104 do you think it ethical to do such an act
2378105 it was her promise and i dont feel like doing any extra work today anyway our guest is waiting we should not leave her in such a state
2378106 id like to hear a bit more before i return home for lunch
2378107 im sorry madam elizabeth but there is some up keep that needs to be completed why dont you hurry home now well have the store all clean for you when you return
2378108 thomas what did you do you must have promised her something in return there is no way someone you have just now met would be so kind on your behalf i will not let you go til you do
2378109 mister wilson i can assure you this was completely her idea even after she made this promise i still did not wish to but you do not deny any lady something as simple as a tale you can tell by the look of her she has money to spend why not some of it go to the likes of us
2378110 oh thomas this surely is incredible and let me tell you this i will give you half of all profits made from todays sales for without you i would not have the money to give use it to buy something nice for sarah will you

2378115 thank you i shall return as soon as i can
2378116 thomas not again oh dear you ripped your shirt it would be nice if i would be allowed a break now again from mending your clothes you ought to be more careful when youre in a hurry the way that you run it would be much faster not to mention safer for you to walk the way

2378144 thomas i know i dont know what to do i cant ask you to give up your life for the sake of mine of course not
2378145 she seemed like a reasonable person surely if i go and talk to her she will reconsider at least on any part that involves you i dont have to stay here like you do sarah and i could move away she couldnt do any damage to us elsewhere
2378146 do not be so certain thomas you have never seen her darker side please be careful
2378147 maam i cannot live here with you i love sarah and am going to spend the rest of my life with her i cannot do that if i am your servant here
2378148 oh thomas how cute it is that you think you have a choice in the matter you are too lowly in society to have realized this but i always get that which i want no one will refuse me in the end
2378149 my dear husband is the mayor of this town his brother is the judge his sisters wife the prosecutor and my entire family is active in society too do you really believe i do not have the power to do what i have threatened to do to your dear master
2378150 he knows enough to figure out what was implied by my request
2378151 i cannot live here i will not he will lose his store anyway without me why give you what you want also
2378152 he will not lose his store because of me i will send him one of my servants who has shall we say passed his prime and no longer interests me

2378170 when i said that you could beat the deputies into submission with your willy i didnt mean that you should it was a turn of phrase it suggested great strength and power it was meant only to raise our morale and utterly destroy theirs
2378171 but since you are the heir to the throne of spanx i thought that you were giving me a 116 royal decree under normal circumstances i would have used my paws and perhaps the nearest available table or window frame i never intended to utilize my most private of parts though you must agree as a cudgel substitute mi guillermo enorme era muy eficiente
2378172 you dont have any right to keep us penned up in here like this the law master of weasels pit has no jurisdiction over the populace of anywhere other than weasels pit youll all hang for this or worse

2378174 your 118 men must have missed her when they came to my inn at my instruction i remind you
2378175 arse holes my men missed nothing you probably had her secreted away out the back somewhere you half breed scoundrel dick
2378176 thought you might have her youngling hidden in there i wondered if you were planning to sell it to the slave trading moles from the dreadful town of bloated gut itd be just like you
2378177 on your way cur youll get nothing from me tonight least of all a roll in a shallow road side ditch i would rather mate with my own esophagus
2378178 who dares utter a sound whilst i speak and who gives a fluff what sort of parasite anyway theyre all the same arent they
2378179 take the wasp for instance that might lay its eggs inside your body then later its larvae would eat you from the insides out are those the type of parasites to which you refer
2378180 now shut the fluff up i have something very important to announce
2378181 that particular nasty lives in your gut and starves you to death by consuming all your food after youve eaten it but before you can gain much sustenance from it and the only way to get rid of it is by pulling it from out of your arse hole is that the parasite to which you refer do you have a tape worm that youd like pulled from out of your arse you certainly appear both irritable and uncomfortable
2378182 ladies gentlehamsters and you lot of filthy scum behold your nemesis awaits our invitation
2378183 throw aside your hood to reveal your identity thereby stunning them all with the fact that someone in your exalted position should do my bidding then go amongst them and select those that ive had marked with a white cross upon their back and denounce them as stix then i can have them carried off into slavery for the wheel is it really that difficult you shaven headed nincompoop
2378184 you lot get off down to the bakery and get yourselves some sausage rolls for breakfast ill wipe out this lot with my mighty sword and powerful arm muscles by myself it shouldnt take more than a few minutes oh and by the way leave the door unlocked my paws might be so bloodied and coated in distasteful gore that i wont be able to turn the lock when i try to leave
2378185 now bugger off the lot of you remain out of trouble and stay incognito if you can just let the situation cool dont go antagonizing the law master so no trying to bust up the wheel for a while now get the fluff out before anyone comes back to witness the executions
2378186 if any of you happen to get recaptured you wont mention this little 126 episode the law master will have me slain in your places and theres loads of you
2378187 i say we corner the bastard on a dark alley and beat him to a pulp
2378188 i say we hang him from the abbey spire by his escroto
2378189 but not before we learn the whereabouts of his wealth i know that its my fathers most fervent wish to reclaim from the pawn brokers his toilet painting kit
2378190 he owns the rancid maggot inn hell be there plotting his revenge for the gross mistreatment that he received from the law master
2378191 i wouldnt be out here if it werent for the tomatillos
2378192 theyre like a tart tomato think granny smith think mexican food
2378193 even though black society would pull for him i still think that they think in the back of their mind that the only reason he is in is because he talks acts and carries himself as a caucasian
2378194 cant you see im on the phone obviously not no one can see if im on the phone or cooking or sweeping the floor or even standing on my head in the corner because no one can see me at all im invisible the invisible mom
2378195 why are you spending so much time carving that bird into a beam that will be covered by the roof no one will ever see it

2378264 know that my wares in the science of hadith are poor
2378265 as for hadith the bare minimum in it is to become thoroughly familiar with the two sahihs verifying your copy by reading it with an expert in the science of hadith texts and it is not necessary for you to memorize the texts of the two sahihs but only familiarize yourself with them thoroughly this way you can obtain whatever you need out of them at will if you want more then add to them other compilations such as the narrations in the sound musnads as for the maximum then it encompasses everything else besides whether weak strong or sound together with knowledge of the many chains of transmission that are conveyed and mastery of the status of the narrators their names and their attributes

2378280 we have a wide array of products that we provide to hispanic customers but when we looked at this more carefully and given the sensitivity of the topic we thought it was best to no longer carry the book in our stores

2378321 it doesnt rule out the possibility completely there are planets around pulsars for example but they must have formed by some rather different mechanisms

2378361 cest un de nos plus mauvais matchs de la saison se souvient patrice maupoux nous navions pas lassise d fensive que nous voulions les malgaches n taient pas l bref nous avons tendu une joue laller nous nallons pas faire la m me chose au retour
2378362 aujourdhui nous sommes dans le wagon des poursuivants poursuit patrice maupoux et comme nous avons en plus un match en retard le challenge peut tre int ressant
2378363 disons que nous sommes un peu mouss s physiquement en ce moment corrige christian dafreville la tr ve na pas eu lieu alors que nous lavions planifi e lors de la phase de pr paration mais par rapport au match aller nous avons aussi progress notamment au niveau tactique
2378364 ce sera un match difficile avec un score serr cest le point commun de tous les derbies et dieu sait que nous en avons dans le sud
2378365 sinc rement cette demi finale de coupe de france que nous aurons jouer contre la jeanne darc mercredi prochain ne me fait ni chaud ni froid lance lentra neur panonnais je ne pense exclusivement quau match contre les avirons a doit tre la m me chose pour mes joueurs

2378367 cest du bonus pour nous qui luttons pour le maintien recadre t il on sy int ressera au moment voulu pour linstant notre priorit cest le championnat
2378368 quimporte souligne lentra neur joueur fabien schneider pour nous il ny a pas quarante mille solutions si on veut se maintenir il faut gagner les matches la maison o lon sest impos quune seule fois cette saison surtout que nous aurons la chance de recevoir six reprises lors des onze derniers matches
2378369 cest lourd m me si dans laffaire nous avons affront les trois premiers pr cise le portier avironnais cest le match contre trois bassins qui nous fait tr s mal puisque tout le monde tait daccord dire quon y avait r ussi lune de nos meilleures prestations au final on a perdu lid al face la gauloise serait de bien jouer marquer des buts et gagner mais on se contenterait aussi dun simple succ s quitte faire un mauvais match

2378377 the bbfc should realize there are scenes of gratuitous violence in the dark knight to which i certainly would not take my 11 year old daughter
2378378 i was astonished that the board could have seen fit to allow anyone under the age of 15 to watch the film unlike past batman films where the villains were somewhat surreal and comical figures heath ledgers joker is a brilliantly acted but very credible psychopathic killer who extols the use of knives to kill and disfigure his victims during a reign of urban terrorism laced with torture
2378379 batman can jump off buildings and fly and the joker is not a realistic character and bounces back with a smile on his face
2378380 guidelines at 12a state that violence must not dwell on detail and that there should be no emphasis on injuries or blood and whilst the dark knight does contain a good deal of violence all of it fits within that definition
2378381 is a superhero movie and the violence it contains exists within that context with both batman and the joker apparently indestructible no matter what is thrown at them
2378382 the current system of classification comes from a time when videogames were in their infancy

2378394 you begin to see the movie for what it actually is simply images on a screen
2378395 thus its always the readers fault that they dont get what youre saying
2378396 its always the really down to earth stuff that appeals to me and most people
2378397 all im suggesting is that you never offer any of your stuff as an escape from anything

2378411 the world may never witness a ceremony of the magnitude and ingenuity as that which opens the 2008 olympics
2378412 most ambitious olympics in history opens with most spectacular show
2378413 for china before a tv audience of 4 billion this was the luckiest moment in a thousand years it is too the start of something even bigger than an olympic games it is or at least is meant to be the beginning of chinas new era of greatness witnessed and implicitly approved by much of the leadership of the planet
2378414 friends who come from far how happy we are to have you here was the message of greeting to the world even the part of the world china has had harsh criticism from
2378415 and in a stroke it made the latest polemics about bushs words on human rights slide away
2378416 because in the run up it was often not the great sporting event that dominated the news flow but the political situation in the host nation
2378417 not the economic giant growing to threatening size but a nation with an ancient culture fascinating sounds and traditional pictures
2378418 not the shocking severity of the dictatorship but what a strictly organised country can achieve if it puts in infinite effort
2378419 about china for at least the next 17 days becoming the world stage the chinese accustomed to humiliation real and perceived by foreigners for centuries are secure enough these days that they were willing even eager to share the spotlight

2378428 we were moving tailbacks to corner and he couldnt understand how these little freshmen were just destroying his dbs

2378433 as a young guy it is a big honor for me to play at the opening ceremony and to represent a new generation of chinese people to the world
2378434 im part of a new generation in china enjoying a very different way of life from our parents we love american culture and classical music but we also have strong chinese traditions
2378435 i fell in love with music and never looked back
2378436 i prefer to live in new york because no matter who you are there you wont be mobbed in china now everybody knows me

2378438 an american version of this material would have had too many explosions and far too much violence and it would have been similar to 30 other thrillers made here during the last 10 years
2378439 all of the major u s buyers saw it everyone liked it but they were reticent because they felt it resembled an american film too much we persevered because we were determined to see it come out in the u s and were very happy that it has finally been so well received there
2378440 landmark theaters saw tell no one early liked it a lot and was casting about for playable films this summer has been short on playable arthouse films so there was a paucity of competition that created a window for us
2378441 i think it is going to keep cruising into september
2378442 we still have key locations to open such as south florida and arizona
2378443 with the right film even a smaller company can really scale things up and do as good a job of releasing a film as a bigger better known company
2378444 if a film is a commercial hit in france it is perceived as not exportable but tell no one proves the arthouse and commercial can overlap
2378445 shall not affect the legal status of the parties to the conflict
2378446 you will see that the recognition of belligerency is an obsolete legal institution which was not even a generalized and accepted practice but rather an instrument of the policy of the usa in the southern american affairs at the turn of the 20th century i have always been amazed at the importance given to this subject by both parties referring to the grp and ndf in the philippines sad enough the application and respect of ihl even in its fundamental principles have been made more difficult because of this unnecessary political requisite
2378447 in practice the traditional international law on recognition of insurgency and belligerency is more theoretical than real
2378448 of mere historical interest is the notion that the government of a state engaged in a conflict may recognize the insurgents as a belligerent party such a declaration was last made during the boer war 1902 recognition of the south as a belligerent in the american war of secession was only tacit
2378449 much of the case law on belligerency derives from wars of independence in south america in the 19th century in a post 1945 context this model is no longer wholly adequate
2378450 today these recognition regimes have been replaced by compulsory rules of international humanitarian law which apply when the fighting reaches certain thresholds
2378451 i didnt expect to be number one it was just the luck of the draw
2378452 im used as cannon fodder they said send the old bugger out there first and see what happens

2378457 we are operating diligently to meet the needs of all clients
2378458 we have no intentions of closing because the need is so great the numbers of positive cases in charlotte continues to rise with the rise in cases comes the need for medical assistance case management financial assistance support groups one on one counseling sessions and the need for client involvement to create a continuum of care with that being said maps mission is to provide all of these services and more

2378460 other nonprofits sometimes experience deficits at the end of their fiscal years also
2378461 the bottom line is you always look at an organizations net assets
2378462 an organization can just about continue operating until their net assets are depleted much like a business does
2378463 in the following year of course you try to more than break even so you get rid of the deficit and add to your net assets

2378524 thats low risk for the studio because they know theyll get those fees back from the show
2378525 that seems to be where the studios feel more comfortable you also see a lot of studios just making blind script deals or specific script deals
2378526 it just feels like everyones a little tighter this year
2378527 the studios are waking up and realizing that the marketplace just changed
2378528 the studios realized they didnt have to pay as much as they historically had supply and demand come into play here theres an abundance of available talent and less demand for it
2378529 as the volume of scripts and pilots and even scripted series go down weve got to be more careful i dont think we need a roster the same size to service what will be less development
2378530 we will still have pilots and presentations but we will never get up to the number we had before in overall deals
2378531 the trend has been in that direction as everyone gets conservative about their development
2378532 but its slower to happen as the whole development business is slower it doesnt happen with the same energy

2378585 its been a little bit hard getting myself back in gear but honestly being here it doesnt feel like ive been away at all those eight years have slipped by very quickly
2378586 the most difficult thing is ive only had one horse to ride until february i hardly jumped a fence in eight years
2378587 its getting your eye in and getting your timing back im not where i was eight years ago but hopefully im good enough
2378588 im used as cannon fodder basically send the old bugger out there and see what happens i guess
2378589 they thought i had enough experience to go out there and lead the way
2378590 its always difficult you never know whether the judges have had a good nights sleep they havent had a chance to have a wine at that time of the morning

2378593 my immediate reaction is im looking forward to the cross country
2378594 after that test im looking forward to giving him a kick over the first fence
2378595 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2378596 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices
2378597 with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly
2378598 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry

2378605 the abundance of elements in the universe has increased as stars have accumulated
2378606 and the formation and destruction of stars continues to spread these elements further across the universe so when you think about it all of the elements in our bodies originally formed from nuclear reactions in the centers of stars long ago
2378607 dr yoshida has taken the study of primordial star formation to a new level with this simulation but it still gets us only to the halfway point towards our final goal it is like laying the foundation of a skyscraper
2378608 we must continue our studies in this area to understand how the initially tiny protostar grows layer by layer to eventually form a massive star but here the physics become much more complicated and even more computational resources are needed

2378639 things such as suffering and the horrific nature of what these folks have gone through
2378640 there are probably people looking into this as we speak right now
2378641 we had a horrific accident as i recall it was a church group driving down interstate 20

2378658 people are now coming around to the fact that growth is slowing both in the u s and overseas so demand for commodities will decline
2378659 everybody is scrambling to get out of the ship before the guy next to them
2378660 its amazing how fast commodities have become the last place people want to have their money
2378661 it looks like the bulls have run out of ammo
2378662 with poor demand prospects ahead theres not a lot of reason to be buying commodities right now
2378663 i dont see them with their scorched fingers coming back into the market that money is gone for a while
2378664 but were not expecting that to happen for at least a few quarters

2378696 its been a trying year in a lot of ways
2378697 but its been a great year in a lot of ways
2378698 hes always been a very aggressive hitter opposing pitchers are not giving him a lot of great pitches to hit and he needs to make adjustments to lay off those pitches
2378699 weve talked to him about that its a process hes a very aggressive hitter he loves to swing the bat sometimes that will hurt you more than help you because you try to do too much
2378700 hes got to start learning how to manage the strike zone manage his at bats be a little more in control of what hes trying to do you dont want to take away the aggressiveness you want him to be aggressive but under control put himself in a better position to be aggressive
2378701 were all about aggressiveness were all about swinging the bat with a purpose but its more a situation of being in a position to be aggressive to be in a position to see the ball well and put an aggressive swing on it right now hes not quite there hes taking aggressive swings at too many pitches

2378708 well it doesnt look so bare oh yeah well theres that
2378709 it certainly caused an extinction of several species in the marine environment
2378710 it wasnt as big as what killed off the dinosaurs but it was what we call an extreme event in the earths history something that doesnt happen very often
2378711 of the big five mass extinctions in the earths history most of them were some kind of impact with the planets surface
2378712 this one is completely earth bound its strictly a natural phenomenon
2378713 because the climate was so warm back than the oceanic current was very sluggish and it initially buffered this magmatic pulse but eventually it all went haywire
2378714 the oxygen was driven from the ocean and all the organic matter accumulated on the bottom of the sea bed and now we have these nice big black shale deposits worldwide source rocks for the petroleum we have today
2378715 organic matter thats decaying returns components like carbon and co 2 to the atmosphere
2378716 but this event locked them up at the bottom of the ocean turning them into oil drawing down the co 2 levels of the ocean and the atmosphere
2378717 theres a bit of an analogy for whats going on today

2378726 you can change your logo and you can change the name of your offering until the cows come home but if you dont change the fundamental way that you operate then the rebranding effort will be for not
2378727 this needs to be just the first salvo in an ongoing effort to become a softer friendlier company to deal with
2378728 this is not putting the cart before the horse this is reflecting improvements already made continuing to be underway in many many areas of the organization as a whole

2378737 ideally they would like it that the only thing the new entrants can pick up is people who already dont have cellphones which is a lot tougher sell
2378738 its going to be tougher for the new entrants especially if they see most of the subscribers when they move into the market already locked into three year contracts

2378870 o prince o chief of many throned powers that led th embattled seraphim to war under thy conduct and in dreadful deeds fearless endangered heavens perpetual king and put to proof his high supremacy whether upheld by strength or chance or fate too well i see and rue the dire event that with sad overthrow and foul defeat hath lost us heaven and all this mighty host in horrible destruction laid thus low as far as gods and heavenly essences can perish for the mind and spirit remains invincible and vigour soon returns though all our glory extinct and happy state here swallowed up in endless misery but what if he our conqueror whom i now of force believe almighty since no less than such could have oerpowered such force as ours have left us this our spirit and strength entire strongly to suffer and support our pains that we may so suffice his vengeful ire or do him mightier service as his thralls by right of war whateer his business be here in the heart of hell to work in fire or do his errands in the gloomy deep what can it the avail though yet we feel strength undiminished or eternal being to undergo eternal punishment
2378871 fallen cherub to be weak is miserable doing or suffering but of this be sure to do aught good never will be our task but ever to do ill our sole delight as being the contrary to his high will whom we resist if then his providence out of our evil seek to bring forth good our labour must be to pervert that end and out of good still to find means of evil which ofttimes may succeed so as perhaps shall grieve him if i fail not and disturb his inmost counsels from their destined aim but see the angry victor hath recalled his ministers of vengeance and pursuit back to the gates of heaven the sulphurous hail shot after us in storm oerblown hath laid the fiery surge that from the precipice of heaven received us falling and the thunder winged with red lightning and impetuous rage perhaps hath spent his shafts and ceases now to bellow through the vast and boundless deep let us not slip th occasion whether scorn or satiate fury yield it from our foe seest thou yon dreary plain forlorn and wild the seat of desolation void of light save what the glimmering of these livid flames casts pale and dreadful thither let us tend from off the tossing of these fiery waves there rest if any rest can harbour there and re assembling our afflicted powers consult how we may henceforth most offend our enemy our own loss how repair how overcome this dire calamity what reinforcement we may gain from hope if not what resolution from despair
2378872 this the seat that we must change for heaven this mournful gloom for that celestial light be it so since he who now is sovereign can dispose and bid what shall be right farthest from him is best whom reason hath equalled force hath made supreme above his equals farewell happy fields where joy for ever dwells hail horrors hail infernal world and thou profoundest hell receive thy new possessor one who brings a mind not to be changed by place or time the mind is its own place and in itself can make a heaven of hell a hell of heaven what matter where if i be still the same and what i should be all but less than he whom thunder hath made greater here at least we shall be free th almighty hath not built here for his envy will not drive us hence here we may reign secure and in my choice to reign is worth ambition though in hell better to reign in hell than serve in heaven but wherefore let we then our faithful friends th associates and co partners of our loss lie thus astonished on th oblivious pool and call them not to share with us their part in this unhappy mansion or once more with rallied arms to try what may be yet regained in heaven or what more lost in hell
2378873 o myriads of immortal spirits o powers matchless but with th almighty and that strife was not inglorious though th event was dire as this place testifies and this dire change hateful to utter but what power of mind forseeing or presaging from the depth of knowledge past or present could have feared how such united force of gods how such as stood like these could ever know repulse for who can yet believe though after loss that all these puissant legions whose exile hath emptied heaven shall fail to re ascend self raised and repossess their native seat for me be witness all the host of heaven if counsels different or danger shunned by me have lost our hopes but he who reigns monarch in heaven till then as one secure sat on his throne upheld by old repute consent or custom and his regal state put forth at full but still his strength concealed which tempted our attempt and wrought our fall henceforth his might we know and know our own so as not either to provoke or dread new war provoked our better part remains to work in close design by fraud or guile what force effected not that he no less at length from us may find who overcomes by force hath overcome but half his foe space may produce new worlds whereof so rife there went a fame in heaven that he ere long intended to create and therein plant a generation whom his choice regard should favour equal to the sons of heaven thither if but to pry shall be perhaps our first eruption thither or elsewhere for this infernal pit shall never hold celestial spirits in bondage nor th abyss long under darkness cover but these thoughts full counsel must mature peace is despaired for who can think submission war then war open or understood must be resolved
2378874 powers and dominions deities of heaven for since no deep within her gulf can hold immortal vigour though oppressed and fallen i give not heaven for lost from this descent celestial virtues rising will appear more glorious and more dread than from no fall and trust themselves to fear no second fate me though just right and the fixed laws of heaven did first create your leader next free choice with what besides in council or in fight hath been achieved of merit yet this loss thus far at least recovered hath much more established in a safe unenvied throne yielded with full consent the happier state in heaven which follows dignity might draw envy from each inferior but who here will envy whom the highest place exposes foremost to stand against the thunderers aim your bulwark and condemns to greatest share of endless pain where there is then no good for which to strive no strife can grow up there from faction for none sure will claim in hell precedence none whose portion is so small of present pain that with ambitious mind will covet more with this advantage then to union and firm faith and firm accord more than can be in heaven we now return to claim our just inheritance of old surer to prosper than prosperity could have assured us and by what best way whether of open war or covert guile we now debate who can advise may speak
2378875 my sentence is for open war of wiles more unexpert i boast not them let those contrive who need or when they need not now for while they sit contriving shall the rest millions that stand in arms and longing wait the signal to ascend sit lingering here heavens fugitives and for their dwelling place accept this dark opprobrious den of shame the prison of his tyranny who reigns by our delay no let us rather choose armed with hell flames and fury all at once oer heavens high towers to force resistless way turning our tortures into horrid arms against the torturer when to meet the noise of his almighty engine he shall hear infernal thunder and for lightning see black fire and horror shot with equal rage among his angels and his throne itself mixed with tartarean sulphur and strange fire his own invented torments but perhaps the way seems difficult and steep to scale with upright wing against a higher foe let such bethink them if the sleepy drench of that forgetful lake benumb not still that in our proper motion we ascend up to our native seat descent and fall to us is adverse who but felt of late when the fierce foe hung on our broken rear insulting and pursued us through the deep with what compulsion and laborious flight we sunk thus low th ascent is easy then th event is feared should we again provoke our stronger some worse way his wrath may find to our destruction if there be in hell fear to be worse destroyed what can be worse than to dwell here driven out from bliss condemned in this abhorred deep to utter woe where pain of unextinguishable fire must exercise us without hope of end the vassals of his anger when the scourge inexorably and the torturing hour calls us to penance more destroyed than thus we should be quite abolished and expire what fear we then what doubt we to incense his utmost ire which to the height enraged will either quite consume us and reduce to nothing this essential happier far than miserable to have eternal being or if our substance be indeed divine and cannot cease to be we are at worst on this side nothing and by proof we feel our power sufficient to disturb his heaven and with perpetual inroads to alarm though inaccessible his fatal throne which if not victory is yet revenge

2379004 with the opening of the beijing olympic games the world has entered an olympic period during these special days the outbreak of armed clashes in south ossetia is something the worlds people do not wish to see
2379005 a ceasefire can give people the chance to reflect on the massive carnage brought by war
2379006 we hope the various parties in the south ossetia dispute exercise calm and restraint and solve their differences through negotiations and not force
2379007 a few days ago i walked along the edge of the lake and was treated to the crunch and rustle of leaves with each step i made the acoustics of this season are different and all sounds no matter how hushed are as crisp as autumn air
2379008 the quote reminds me of an autumn morning where all the leaves are orange and dry so that when stepped on or disturbed they make a crisp crunching sound every season and its sounds are different like spring is the birds singing summer is the splash and laughter of summer vacation and winter is the soft silence of death and rebirth of spring and life again autumn is only a crunch and russle for food and shelter for up coming winter
2379009 every season has its sounds and when you stop and listen there is a hidden beauty to it that gets lost in the hustle and bussle of our lives school work and more get you in a rush so much that you completely miss it
2379010 beachwood sparks have more in common with buffalo springfield than the similarity of names but this bs take the implicit country influence of their forebears add a psychedelic steel guitar and invoke the ghost of gram parsons in a way that makes you forget everything thats happened in music since 1972
2379011 newer groups like can joy division new order dinosaur jr sonic youth primal scream and the rain parade we like old psychedelia and freakbeat and country and soul and jazz and dub it was a good century for it anyway given those parameters the bands sound is possibly a mix of any of those but we leave declension of commonality to chemists bankers and such
2379012 david crosby and gram parsons never got to grow up hearing sonic youth or dinosaur jr were comfortable playing a country song that goes into space rock i remember playing gigs where we would take the stage and say no songs wed go to outer space right now were more into traditional songs and arrangements
2379013 the move toward a more traditional countrified sound was conscious and natural we started out with a vision weve come back to
2379014 its a total score to be a chemist of sorts if it was just straight country not only would i not be able to do it but i wouldnt be able to do an authentic rendition
2379015 you can put a cowboy hat on if you want
2379016 chris and i were really into further when we were dee jaying up at kxlu i became especially interested a bit later on when they were evolving into this blend of the exciting things that were going on with the indie rock sounds of the time and this timeless vision of a classic california west coast sound
2379017 thats something i put up when i was working years back
2379018 i hoped it would serve as a trading post for anyone to leave a note for others to come across it also has music links i havent had the time or technology to really cultivate that idea fully but we still get a lot of interesting people passing through i hope it can grow this year and link up with a good beachwood sparks website too
2379019 the next winter different people were moving in different directions and soon it was just four of us and the change in our music was instantaneous with that first rehearsal we found that we were well on our way to that sound wed dreamed of in the first place
2379020 this is our first single which came out in 1963 was the year i believe
2379021 chris wrote the words and they explain themselves beautifully its a great way to start off our album and his words say how all of us feel which is why we love to play it for me it echoes songs like here we are in the years by neil young isnt it a pity by george harrison or away from the city by the summer hits the music behind the words has changed right along with ourselves the group kind of has a mean stomp to it these days doesnt it
2379022 that one is kind of like a nursery rhyme extolling this character who goes down under the sea in a diving bell and finds all these treasures of sound to bring back to eager ears waiting upon yon bleak shore its really a thank you song for all the artists bands music heads record freaks really any one of these pioneers who go above and beyond the herd to find something special in the world and then bring it back and share it with the world being like it is we need these people and must appreciate them so its a musical thank you and its a good one to hear live
2379023 wed love to get across the country and to japan and england
2379024 im sure theyve got a great future new songs are popping out like crazy i wouldnt be surprised if they had another record ready before the year is out bomp may do another single or an ep or something else with them the possibility has been discussed but not the details
2379025 whens the last time mellow was used to describe an insanely popular new band
2379026 sophomore effort once we were trees pushed the signature sound into psychedelic places where parsons had never been many of the albums tracks begin nice and steady with honky tonk fingerpicking an woozy pedal steel but ended in a miasma of organ drone and haunting harmony vocals a little too weird for the expecting more cookie cutter cowboy songs trees was met with as much puzzlement as praise
2379027 like the first two stooges albums the first two zeppelin albums our new record will be like side three and four of 2000s beachwood sparks

2379032 are not patriotic and theyve had extramarital affairs on occasion in my opinion that may stimulate the economy of law firms but it would be a poor choice for mayor
2379033 before i decided to run for mayor i had residences in all 4 wards always setting goals for myself i thought when i was done counciling in ward 4 id like to try ward 1 or 2 and possibly because ive been ambitious ever since i was a walking child be on the ballot for all 4 wards simultaneously walking has helped me to familiarize myself with my neighborhoods and the members in all the communities where i probably live at the present time im also running for mayor of clear lake iowa
2379034 another reason i like to walk although its only noticeable in summer i have a tall thin stature walking 60 80 miles a day helps me work up an appetite after a long day of walking i grab a salad and relax for a few hours by working out at lifetime fitness on highway 3

2379038 i liked what we did there was some good progress
2379039 overall i am happy with the way it went we have made some progress from the last ballgame we played and thats what you can look for and hope for
2379040 we still have a long way to go a few things we need to iron out we had some unforced penalties offsides and that nature but overall i liked what we are doing on offense defense and special teams
2379041 we were treating it like a game as good as you can putting it in a different situations
2379042 we are going to do a lot of those types of things just putting them in as many different situations as we can so that they understand that when things happen in the game its not a shock
2379043 ive seen drew willy continue to do some good things he is throwing the ball really well so far in camp he and the receivers are on the same page on things we are very very pleased with him
2379044 i think the secondary is playing really well and i like the things we are doing across the defensive unit i really feel good about those guys i do see great potential of us being a very good defensive unit you may not have the superstars or that sort of thing but i think we are going to be a better unit
2379045 offensively i would say andrew west croswell mi croswell lexington at right tackle he and jordan jerrold fairless hills pa pennsbury are battling it out for that spot and andrew has done a good job
2379046 defensively anel montanez trumbull ct trumbull is a guy that has really done well hes a trong physical kid who moves very very well and can make some plays for us at the nose guard position
2379047 i see that we have talent and thats good to see
2379048 we have some numbers but its going to be a work in progress as we go along but i feel very good about it because we have speed and we have some physical players
2379049 i think they are going to pretty good before its all done we just hope its going to be pretty quick
2379050 i feel very good about jimmy willliams coaching linebackers and doing some things with our defense

2379526 cristiano ronaldo es feliz en el manchester united siempre lo ha sido fue la desafortunada actuaci n del real madrid en este asunto la que le puso dif ciles las cosas
2379527 eso fue uno de los puntos b sicos para conseguir convencerle de que se quedara
2379528 hay muy pocos jugadores que se han ido del united contra mi voluntad y es muy raro que un futbolista quiera irse de este club yo creo que cristiano se dio cuenta de eso

2379557 the reality is that green power is going to be more expensive
2379558 wind has turned out to be so far much more expensive than forecast by the politicians and the wind power lobby in the next 11 years europe will be overwhelmed with new orders for wind capacity and that is likely to increase costs still further
2379559 it is a myth that renewables are going to be cheap the power industry and government have been too silent on this and people think it wont cost anything
2379560 wind turbines do cost a lot to install but all that cost is upfront and after that there is no fuel to buy and the running costs are low it generates a secure supply and the price stays constant because it is not subject to the vagaried of the global markets

2379792 he promised to grant me an interview when his journey was finished and looked for a visiting card to give me only to discover he didnt have his wallet and said he would pop out for a moment a waiter told him not to worry he could come back the next day but henry left anyway saying he d be right back
2379793 when you abseil you must take two ropes and he only took one rope
2379794 they could do nothing because when he was falling it was too late
2379795 i was a pretty fat kid didnt do much other than eat and play computer games
2379796 these last years ive lost my belly and took climbing seriously finding it a vent from life and somewhere to push myself competitively ive learnt a lot about myself some of it good some of it bad
2379797 i always worried about him when he went climbing but i never stopped him doing his dream
2379798 now our peacekeepers are waging a fierce battle with regular forces from the georgian army in the southern region of ossetian capital tskhinvali
2379799 what russia is doing in georgia is open unhidden aggression and a challenge to the whole world
2379800 if the whole world does not stop russia today then russian tanks will be able to reach any other european capital
2379801 we want to be free and we want to be a multi ethnic democracy
2379802 russia has bombed the black sea port of poti and the military base at senaki we think russia has started to bomb civil and economic infrastructure
2379803 there are bodies of women old people and children lying in the streets
2379804 make no mistake about it this is already war a very real painful war
2379805 i have lived there throughout all the previous conflicts including the war in the early 1990s and they were always fought by soldiers against other soldiers
2379806 now the difference is that its the civilian population thats taking the brunt of the aggression
2379807 i saw bodies on the streets in cars its impossible to count them there is hardly a single building undamaged
2379808 he let go i let go and it tipped over
2379809 i forgot he was down there i reached over and i stepped on him by accident
2379810 he was following the guidance perfectly but at 1 000ft andrew turned away from the target landing area and became slumped in his harness
2379811 he hung forward his head was bowed and his arms were hanging straight down
2379812 the instructor repeated his instruction to the student to turn left to come back to the zone there was no response

2379819 we have the physical system were taking flow measurements of actual swimmers and were getting more information than anyone has ever had before about swimming and how the swimmer interacts with the water and so far these techniques have contributed to some very significant improvements in the lap times of olympic swimmers
2379820 this project moved the swimming world beyond the observational into scientific fact
2379821 the knowledge gained gave me the foundation for which every technical stroke change in preparation for the beijing olympics was based
2379822 to see how a swimmers motion affects the flow you need to know how much force the swimmer is producing and how that force impacts the water
2379823 swimming research has strived to understand water flow around a swimmer for decades because how a swimmers body moves the surrounding water is everything
2379824 the ability to measure flow and forces in a natural and unimpeded environment hasnt been available until recently and dr weis technology and methods presented usa swimming with a unique opportunity that united states swimmers and coaches could learn a lot from

2379831 this is a disease we see in a lot of older patients with other illnesses so the decision to send them to surgery requires careful consideration cryoablation therapy is particularly attractive for older patients who may have complications or other medical issues such as accompanying heart or lung diseases that make traditional surgeries for barretts with dysplasia too risky

2379841 people are very bad at calculating survival probabilities twenty years ago fertility started to decline in nepal and bangladesh when they were still poor korea wasnt rich when fertility declined by contrast the gulf oil states continued with high birthrates long after they got huge wealth
2379842 theres been an extraordinary change in 20 years and it comes from a combination of factors
2379843 they have had 5 to 6 per cent economic growth over the past 15 years and in areas like the textile industry that provides work for lots of ordinary people a woman can earn 25 30 a month in a garment factory thats big money and if you have two daughters working it is delaying the age at which women marry it used to be 14 or 15 now its 21 or 22 another factor is the success of ngos non governmental organisations 20 million households in bangladesh have access to micro finance and in half of them the money goes to the women then there has been education for girls encouraged by programmes that gave cereals to families whose girls went to secondary school and cash for education female stipends
2379844 in africa most women work in agriculture around the home
2379845 but in bangladesh women get out and meet other women at work who may be using contraception getting outside the home fixes a new social norm prosperity and fertility are interlinked in a chicken and egg way
2379846 food sex and procreation are core elements of humanity and changes to them are often met with fierce hostility
2379847 in my view the evidence is that there is something intrinsic to the culture its there in the rich muslim states in the gulf in saudi arabia and in the muslim provinces of the former soviet union it is perhaps bound up with the status of women
2379848 not just in catholic spain and italy but in orthodox greece the strong traditions are not boosting fertility rate as many might suppose
2379849 many women in the developed world will become overloaded and respond by cutting down the number of children they have

2379853 breast feeding is associated with resilience against the psychosocial stress linked with parental divorce separation
2379854 theres a lot less verbal communication but lots of tactile communication and eye contact that promotes positive physiological responses
2379855 breast feeding does seem to suppress stress responses in babies and it does seem that theres a protective effect
2379856 in terms of the biological possibility breast milk is pretty amazing stuff and the tactile interaction that goes along with breast feeding does have an influence on the development of neurons
2379857 for most mothers breast feeding doesnt come naturally if the baby doesnt latch on it can lead to feelings of failure and concern about whether or not the baby is getting enough milk women need lots of encouragement and education
2379858 breast feeding is something for mothers and babies to enjoy a time for them to cherish and nurture each other

2379874 paraguay tiene 20 por ciento de pobres y el objetivo es bajar a la mitad al t rmino de mi mandato
2379875 paraguay es dependiente casi el 100 por ciento del combustible del exterior nuestra empresa estatal llamada petropar por ejemplo hoy por ayer tuvimos una experiencia quisimos cargar combustible y no lo hemos encontrado hay una escasa distribuci n no hay absolutamente nada de reserva incluso no han hecho licitaci n para insumos de salud imag nense asumir el 15 de agosto y no encontrar medicamentos y gasoil es un pa s que se puede incendiar en menos de dos o tres meses en ese sentido dec amos que hay una especie de complot como para que no funcionen las instituciones estatales
2379876 deber ser un gobierno muy institucional pero muy popular al mismo tiempo buscaremos relaciones con las instituciones porque hay gobernaciones que no son del signo pol tico nuestro como itap a pero buscaremos tener las mejores relaciones institucionales sin dejar de lado a aquellos que no comparten el signo pol tico del gobierno nacional de turno no queremos ser una isla en la regi n y no vamos a desentonar en la regi n queremos un gobierno progresista que est a la altura de los acontecimientos y los desaf os del siglo xxi en tanto haya proyectos que impulsen el crecimiento del pa s buscaremos acercamientos con todos los estamentos de la sociedad

2379885 hemos conversado con el equipo y el gabinete sobre el proyecto hidroel ctrico de corpus

2379903 los propios misioneros no se ponen de acuerdo respecto a qu proyecto quieren
2379904 sabemos que tenemos que mejorar en nuestra atenci n defensiva porque algunos goles han sido en bal n parado pero estamos en el camino para corregir para que no vuelvan a suceder en el partido contra atlas fuimos capaces de rectificar en buen momento y logramos el resultado en san luis la situaci n fue m s clara no tuvimos la intensidad ni el futbol que desarrollamos con anterioridad y no nos alcanz el tiempo sabemos que si queremos mantener una buena racha de resultados debemos de ser constantes durante los 90 minutos
2379905 hemos tenido lapsos muy buenos de posesi n de pelota de llegar a la porter a rival pero no nos hemos mantenido en el nivel los 90 minutos tal vez porque no entramos con la debida atenci n a la cancha o porque un gol en contra nos modifica todo pero es algo que platicamos en estos dos con la intenci n de solucionarlo hay que ser conscientes del trabajo defensivo del equipo desde el delantero hasta el portero podemos mejorar en muchas situaciones hay que buscar la manera de concretar en ello y de lograr la victoria en casa
2379906 me parece que es un equipo que se renov y que est concentrado en librar la situaci n del descenso y han tenido dos resultados que manejaron bien ante indios de ciudad ju rez y chivas y me parece que por ello el de ma ana ser un partido muy complicado
2379907 hay que ser anal ticos de las situaciones y me parece que tecos es un equipo que sabe manejar los tiempos sacar un resutlado con diez hombres menos halba de que son un equipo ordenado en eso ha ganado mucho tecos y prometen ser un buen rival en la competencia

2379951 o crescimento da religi o evang lica tem dois aspectos o primeiro que as pessoas no brasil agora reconhecem o valor da m sica crist a m sica gospel transcende a religi o apresenta uma mensagem que fala o bem para as pessoas e conseq entemente elas ouvem as m sicas e entendem a realidade do que o evangelho

2379963 i really feel that what investors are looking for right here is signs that the economy is starting to pick up right now
2379964 it looks like we are finally getting the break weve been waiting for in terms of slowing down the inflation spiral that has been taking place
2379965 you have a tremendous rise in the dollar and thats putting pressure on crude oil which is helping to buoy u s equity markets
2379966 clearly the economy is still weak some of the stimulus from the tax rebates is
2379967 i think the key to watch for is the unemployment number once you go above 6 percent the concerns about recession will go up
2379968 look at the prices of food around the world its unfair to look at just the price of oil as the leading indicator of where inflation trends may be
2379969 theres strong likelihood that the fed is going to have to start to raise interest rates to control inflation
