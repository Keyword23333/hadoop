7600000 we have friends who are married and work from home but they have offices in two separate bedrooms
7600001 luke and i find it more productive to work in the same room because when we need to ask each other a question all we have to do is speak up that way we dont have to keep getting up and walking back and forth
7600002 as a married couple when you move from conventional office jobs to working together in your own business you go from not having much time together to being around each other most of the day everyday
7600003 it can be a challenge to define life as husband and wife and life as business partners because its hard to separate the two still we would rather work together in our own business than go our separate ways in the morning working for someone else
7600004 we reached a point in our careers where we felt that it would be better to invest our knowledge and abilities in our own business than for someone else
7600005 that is a risky step if you want to work for yourself though its a step you must take
7600006 typically one spouse remains at home with the child while the other works long hours and doesnt spend as much time with the family as he or she would like
7600007 i am able to continue working while caring for isabelle and luke is able to spend more time with us
7600008 couples who work traditional office jobs just share a few tidbits about their work day when they get home
7600009 when you work together and out of a home office your business occupies a tremendous part of your life
7600010 its important to take time for yourself and away from each other
7600011 take the dog to the park go to the gym me time is valuable for both the husband and the wife
7600012 it is ideal to set office hours and stick to them sometimes that is difficult especially when you work at home but it is good for your mental well being
7600013 we try to take off weekends and spend them together not talking about work sometimes that is easier said than done
7600014 you have to respect each others feelings and beliefs and feel comfortable with each persons responsibilities
7600015 we get to spend time with each other and our daughter and we are working as a team to build our business
7600016 working together when you are married is not for everyone

7600032 we are united and we are together and we are determined
7600033 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7600034 it would have been the same way if i had won and barack was here supporting the unity of the party this was a hard fought campaign and there was a lot of intensity and passion associated with it in part because of the historic nature of our two candidacies
7600035 i dont know im doing everything i can possibly do and i think we have made a strong case
7600036 others feel an obligation to the people who sent them here that they were elected to represent
7600037 that however they decide to vote we will all be united behind senator obama
7600038 we have a very good working relationship and it is through that relationship that we have worked out a lot of the issues

7600049 this shouldnt be a hardship for most nurseries as many have already cut back or stopped raising ash because of the declining demand for it
7600050 although it is a disappointment to find the early detection of the emerald ash borer it is not a surprise
7600051 we have been preparing for an event like this for some time right now we are doing what we can to determine the location of the emerald ash borer we hope to have that information soon and begin the next steps in battling this pest

7600130 it really fed into the art programs in the schools and how to grow them it was wonderful
7600131 its a great example of how museums address societal needs
7600132 the primary objective for this program is to come away with a better sense of modern and contemporary art
7600133 you can see the light bulbs and the sparks going off as theyre getting new ideas each day
7600134 plus im really excited that teachers in other disciplines want to use art to teach
7600135 in general i think its a challenging time for the arts in the schools in america
7600136 we know that from lots of different research that the arts are a great benefit to the advancement of children in schools and in life
7600137 its very clear that appreciating art and learning about art is a step in critical thinking
7600138 it exposed me to art that i had not spent a lot of time with before and of course i loved going to all five museums

7600188 quickbooks online is perfect for us as there is no office just volunteer member parents working from various home or work offices
7600189 a growing number of small businesses are looking to mobile technology to run their business

7600194 senator obama had 51 percent of the democratic vote senator clinton had 50 percent of the democratic vote its kind of a no brainer that thats your ticket
7600195 he just needs to let them know who he is
7600196 bailey was outstanding hes jumping up a division and hes not that long out of non league football so weve taken a big gamble on him
7600197 its the only money im going to spend but hes lived up to every penny of the 400 000 he was brilliant for us
7600198 emmanuel is a very good player its wonderful to watch him he makes your eyes open wide with some of his tricks but he can also do the simple things well
7600199 daniel has got everything in his locker for one so young he has got great talent and hes also learning about the physicality of the game
7600200 neither of them are close to being ready to start a game but the best development for them now will be getting bits and pieces here and there
7600201 we will give them another week of training and they will be involved in the game against sunderland as well in the carling cup until they are ready to start matches
7600202 it is frustrating we have not been able to repeat our performance against aberdeen but we played very well as a team that day in defence and attack
7600203 none of us is perfect and we are trying to work on our game every day under the leadership of the manager
7600204 missing a penalty hitting the bar and missing chances is disappointing but overall im pleased with my sides performance
7600205 we have to keep playing like that if we do and we win games fantastic if we play like that but dont win weve just got to live with it because you cant ask any more than that
7600206 at this special moment i want to send a message to the chelsea fans who have always made me feel their support a heartfelt thank you for that
7600207 for me its like winning the champions league there were complications but now everything is resolved im really happy
7600208 cardiff have given me the chance to show what i can do and i cant wait to get started
7600209 people here in britain eat drink and sleep football its an ambition of mine to make an impact and now i want to do that with cardiff
7600210 i believe i can score goals and do well here when i signed for fulham in january i knew it would take time for me to settle in but now i am ready to push on
7600211 i believe cardiff are going to be successful this season and i want to be a part of that
7600212 one of our problems last year was we needed a bit of edge dig and steel in the middle of the park
7600213 he has got composure when he is on the ball and he doesnt waste very many balls but when theres a ball to be won he invariably wins it
7600214 i have watched the dvd and can not understand how the referee came to his decision
7600215 i dont want to get into trouble over this but it was a case of two players rightly competing for the ball
7600216 you lose that player its always going to be tough
7600217 by the letter of the law the tackles were yellow cards but if there are going to be challenges like that we are going to book every single player with every challenge
7600218 there are safety and security issues in just about every country in the world that we play with the exception of new zealand
7600219 professional risk assessment says the risk is acceptable in some of those places unfortunately at the moment its not acceptable in pakistan
7600220 what were all desperately hoping now is the situation in pakistan settles down and allows us to go back there next year we havent had a senior australian team in pakistan for a long time
7600221 the neck is fine and 100 per cent but he has lost a lot of weight hes well underdone in terms of conditioning so it would be a very calculated risk should we play richard
7600222 we will take some guidance from the player himself on whether hes mentally ready but i think hes been in the game long enough to know he would only go out there if he was confident he could be an effective player
7600223 i have a lot of faith in richard to make the right decision
7600224 we would like to bring somebody in we would like to bring a minimum of two people into the football club if we can
7600225 we are not a champions league team we have got some champions league qualities about us in terms of effort and desire and all that
7600226 but what we have got to try to do is bring in two players who we can put into that first team to make us better and not just two bodies

7600235 he added that initially meeting the voice quality and data rates of sprints 3g network would have been both technically and financially impossible despite the customer benefit
7600236 the most astute thing you can do is be as late as possible and as fast as possible because its going to cost you more if you do it too early and if you do it too late you dont get the features you want

7600246 please correct me if im wrong but i understand that most imams and clerics of islam have declared a holy jihad holy war against the infidels of the world and that by killing an infidel which is a command to all muslims they are assured of a place in heaven if thats the case can you give me the definition of an infidel
7600247 so let me make sure i have this straight all followers of allah have been commanded to kill everyone who is not of your faith so they can go to heaven is that correct
7600248 well sir i have a real problem trying to imagine pope john paul commanding all catholics to kill those of your faith or pat robertson or dr stanley ordering protestants to do the same in order to go to heaven
7600249 i also have problem with being your friend when you and your brother clerics are telling your followers to kill me let me ask you a question would you rather have your allah who tells you to kill me in order to go to heaven or my jesus who tells me to love you because i am going to heaven and he wants you to be with me

7600252 we are united and we are together and we are determined
7600253 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7600254 it would have been the same way if i had won and barack was here supporting the unity of the party this was a hard fought campaign and there was a lot of intensity and passion associated with it in part because of the historic nature of our two candidacies
7600255 i dont know im doing everything i can possibly do and i think we have made a strong case
7600256 others feel an obligation to the people who sent them here that they were elected to represent

7600262 attempt to construct a concept of god that modern secular people will find plausible
7600263 what kind of god would be plausible in this postmodern age taken by itself that question represents the great divide between those who believe in the god of the bible and those who see the need to reinvent a deity more acceptable to the modern mind

7600267 those overdue fees and fines they do add up so at our library with the size of our community in fort smith we take in about 100 000 every year

7600305 a splash of innovation in the staid local architecture scene
7600306 will be filled with familiar art wrapped in outdoor sculpture and vegetation
7600307 shrubs are filling in trees are spreading out its easy to imagine thick bands of greenery in five years that offer visual screens and a true sense of place the small park has blossomed as well youll see people with dogs and people with cell phones a street person can be napping on a bench while kids clamber on the play structure and life goes on

7600316 a couple of his teammates in a fit of high spirits took a photo of him sitting on a toilet and in what they saw as a prank circulated this photo to other team members

7600318 all three swimmers are very remorseful and have apologised to team management for what was poor judgement on their part and accept the punishment handed down

7600322 she in common with the great majority of international transit passengers is not obliged to pass through new zealand customs processing points provided she elects to remain in the transit areas of the international airport
7600323 transit passengers often have no contact at all with our officers
7600324 while we do have the legal authority to interact with transit passengers we would normally only do so where there was intelligence to indicate a threat was present
7600325 we share intelligence with agencies all around the world but we do not get every drug smuggler or every shipment of contraband that comes our way
7600326 that is a sad fact of life for customs agencies everywhere

7600370 when cma made the announcement earlier this year about who would be inducted into the country music hall of fame in 2008

7600380 the gc games convention will be back in leipzig again in 2009
7600381 the industry and visitors are giving us their clear support to continue with the fair in leipzig
7600382 the concept is flexible and the network of the global games industry permits us to be active at different locations
7600383 after the southeast asian games convention we are now focusing on the north american market

7600385 we still dont have a lot of answers about senator obama
7600386 im hillary clinton and i do not approve of that message
7600387 there would be no chance for mr heim to take control of his fathers money as long as there is no hint or proof for mr heims demise there is no legal basis for german authorities to declare him dead
7600388 i do not see any way the kids can inherit the bank account of their father
7600389 as long as we dont know he is dead we have to assume hes still alive
7600390 we are staying tuned to his case as we are talking about very cruel crimes

7600395 had not yet achieved the complete reconciliation that we need
7600396 now i understand that the mccain campaign is running ads trying to divide us
7600397 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7600398 hes truly humbled by the outpouring of support and wouldnt miss it for anything in the world
7600399 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7600400 a lot of democrats will vote mccain its ok really
7600401 the nomination is decided we have a vice president were going to work together and go forward
7600402 i am here because of the opportunities that my father had that my mother had you know we are who americans were supposed to be

7600404 severely hamper our land livelihood food production safe water and ecological balance
7600405 we must ensure food security for the global people particularly for the people of developing countries with collective efforts
7600406 we have been finalising an action plan for bangladesh as a living document to face the adverse effects of climate change
7600407 so it has to be addressed regionally as well as through cooperation and mutual support
7600408 it wont be possible to fulfil the conditions of the rpo without holding a party council it is not possible to hold a party council within this period amidst a state of emergency
7600409 as we have already written to the ec for another round of talks we will take a final decision on the matter through the talks
7600410 the presence of our party chairperson is also a must to change the constitution of bnp
7600411 it is not possible to hold a council during ramadan and so we lose a valuable 30 days here
7600412 it wont be right to take any decisions centrally without consultation with the grassroots level leaders
7600413 if anyone faces any problems in holding party council amidst the state of emergency or face problems in understanding the provisions of rpo related to registration then they should come to us we are ready to help them
7600414 its unfortunate that we couldnt follow the electoral roadmap with regard to registration
7600415 if needed well ask the government to ensure an atmosphere conducive to organising councils any political party can inform us if they face any difficulties
7600416 pains of pension an exploration into corruption in delivery of public pension
7600417 in this case the first and second class officials have to pay 50 percent bribe and third class employees 45 percent to secure the certificate in one to seven days
7600418 the number of processing institutions and procedural complexities grow with every grade upward gazetted employees and superior non gazetted employees had more responsibilities than their subordinates while in service so they have greater risks of facing audit objections than their junior counterparts
7600419 unless we consider it a right corruption is unlikely to end in the sector
7600420 its unfair that future generations will pay for the older generations
7600421 my representative was asked by the officials concerned for more than tk 50 000 in bribe i simply didnt agree
7600422 there is an agreement between the two sides that there will be no foreign soldiers in iraq after 2011

7600424 most of these workers are not aware when they leave bangladesh that they will be working for such low wages
7600425 we do not want the image of bangladesh to be sullied by only a handful of our nationals
7600426 we call for abolishing the sponsor system and adopting a system similar to the ones in more developed countries
7600427 the only people who benefit from the sponsor system are the visa traders who use their influence to maintain the status quo
7600428 bnp is one of the largest political parties how is it possible to hold parliamentary elections keeping bnp away
7600429 otherwise the election will not be acceptable to us and others
7600430 the election commission tried to split bnp but now they have understood the truth
7600431 tarique went to the bathroom at about 12 15 noon as he was about to come out he felt he could not move his right leg he tried to walk on his left leg and fell on the sink
7600432 i had a conversation with tarique he talked with me normally and his pressure was normal
7600433 if needed he would be sent abroad for treatment which is the matter of the government
7600434 i asked him about his health condition but he was too sick to say anything
7600435 we have decided to quit the coalition and sit on the opposition benches in parliament
7600436 we have taken this decision after we failed to find any ray of hope and none of the commitments made to us were fulfilled

7600446 at one stage the cylinder exploded with a big bang injuring at least three persons
7600447 firefighters came after the explosion but by that time the vehicle was burnt to ashes
7600448 the government forces still surround the camp there is no fighting now but tension is high throughout the camp and no one knows where the wounded people have been taken
7600449 this morning security forces surrounded kalma camp and demanded that every idp internally displaced person leave
7600450 later they opened fire on the eastern side of the camp there were many casualties up to now we have 27 confirmed dead and 75 wounded
7600451 government forces killed 25 idps this happened before the eyes of the hybrid force i urge the international community to protect idps
7600452 the unamid leadership is closely monitoring the situation with serious concern
7600453 we called off regular patrols in kalma because it not part of our mandate to search for arms and arrest individuals
7600454 shortly after we got calls from sheikhs who said those officers had already positioned themselves in the camp and that shots were fired
7600455 a unamid police and military force accessed the camp to assess the situation and we are prepared for possible assistance in the case of evacuating any type of casualties

7600470 i really stopped reading superheroes when i was about 12 i was a little too old to start reading marvel in the 60s i didnt take to them i didnt think that they represented a new phase of art
7600471 i feel that the world of underground comics is so much my generation there are so many people among them who are very good friends of mine including crumb and bill griffith the only one who could make it into the dailies that these are the ones that my heart went to plus those people in mainstream get 300 a page and they dont even have to ink they have health plans unlike my pals who have none of those things and are scraping along i feel like im their champion
7600472 if the breakthrough to formal acceptance bears on unmistakably jewish name
7600473 hollywood has you convinced that it takes 100 million to make a quality piece of art and thats a piece of crap statement and i think you just saw that right
7600474 weve fleshed out the details of what was announced in the budget and the details are the exciting part
7600475 it means hundreds of thousands of dollars in new support for students from low and middle income families
7600476 step into a career and ultimately a very successful life
7600477 we dont want to be instrumental in overthrowing any government we dont have any such intentions
7600478 this organization is a terrorist organization and created mayhem against public life
7600479 i think at the moment they definitely have the upper hand and we need to do something better
7600480 we are neither registered nor do we have any bank accounts
7600481 i could tour for months on end with no problem if we didnt stop back through denver
7600482 on tour its like youre sleepwalking youre on autopilot but when you come home youre reminded of all the people youre not seeing the life that you were living before and it feels a little weird
7600483 we started asking questions early so no one was evicted and no one lost housing over this
7600484 but yes this potentially could have really hurt some low income families out there
7600485 i always think its fun with that kind of stuff because thats what the minor leagues are about
7600486 its like that old bull durham promotion hit the bull win a steak
7600487 there were no hard feelings it could have been a matter of time place or difference of opinion
7600488 all i ever cared about was getting the players respect on the baseball field
7600489 like many african american singers i developed my voice and gained experience by leading solos in church choirs
7600490 although id been exposed to all types of music throughout my life it was during my college days that i began to expand my appreciation for jazz particularly classic and straight ahead jazz
7600491 with few exceptions ive found most jazz musicians young and old to be very humble loving and giving people
7600492 ed understood and appreciated my desire to pay tribute to oscars music so he and her friend donald meade provided the motivation and guidance
7600493 in these troubled times when lands are torn to pieces and sorrows flow and no one knows what tomorrow may bring
7600494 bless the tie that binds all humanity to take a stand and today demand that all gods children are free
7600495 it was adventurous and virtuosic but the groove and swing was familiar and comfortable
7600496 the trio always sounded like they were having so much fun
7600497 we dont realize how fortunate we are to live in an area where you can hear jazz 24 hours a day
7600498 the jazz studies programs at area universities such as nccu duke unc and shaw and those at the middle and high schools are key to the triangles jazz scene
7600499 in addition to bringing in world class jazz artists the university programs provide students and the public opportunities to participate in and learn about jazz
7600500 for me singing is very personal so its difficult to separate from my personal life
7600501 phonte and big pooh both do great fat guy dances
7600502 and fuck village voice for sending tom breihan to review that doom show thats like sending a vegan to review the 30th annual new hope baptist church fried chicken contest
7600503 your song still needs a chorus i know youll figure it out
7600504 kenny chesney is in terms of attendance the top touring act in north america over the past five years in any genre
7600505 as the impact of traditional advertising models decreases sponsors are increasingly looking to live music as a way to reach consumers in an efficient targeted manner country music fans are very highly regarded by brands as loyal active consumers given the images of both in my opinion chesney and corona are a natural fit
7600506 this will be a seven year deal including a five year tour sponsorship
7600507 we already filmed the first two commercials down in tulum mexico a few months ago
7600508 we approached kennys team a while back about the idea of exploring various projects that might be a good fit for both kenny and corona
7600509 as we began these discussions it became very clear in very short order that this would be a perfect fit for both parties and we just kicked things off this year
7600510 the term partnership really is the most accurate description of the relationship between kenny and corona in that it goes well beyond your standard tour sponsorship
7600511 the partnership involves a whole range of activities including advertising campaigns digital initiatives and retail programs in fact we introduced the tv commercials with kenny this spring
7600512 they are selling the same message we are they get our vision and we get theirs as well corona personifies escape
7600513 if you want to capture my audience the thing that stands out is their ability to have more fun in a single day than most people have in a month
7600514 corona is part of those relaxed hanging out with your buddies kinds of days
7600515 some sponsorships are just about cashing a check but not this one
7600516 as we continue to figure out ways to grow the kenny chesney brand this is going to be a big piece of the puzzle the vision of the two brands intersects very well they refer to the brand as a vacation in a bottle and we refer to ours as a vacation on the stage and when you can marry those two brands so well it just makes sense i mean its not like kennys selling cheez whiz or something
7600517 songs like old blue chair beer in mexico no shoes no shirt no problems all speak to the laid back island vibe that kenny articulates so well in much of his music
7600518 its that same attitude and persona that corona has been communicating over the years so although there are a number of obvious reasons we would love to work with an artist of kenny chesneys stature that one would certainly be right at the top of the list
7600519 i cant think of an artist more devoted to his fans than kenny chesney
7600520 its an amazing thing to experience that connection between kenny and his audience at a live show and for corona to be part of that is really exciting it has much less to do with demographics and target audiences than it has to do with the level of involvement and enthusiasm that comes out of that whole experience
7600521 aint no lord gonna judge me now aint no woman gonna put me down
7600522 i dont know what exactly happened but when they started hardly art wed been brought up and
7600523 but soon it became evident to me that they like their music are ageless they were far from contrived never pretentious and so honestly real i just hoped that i could convey what they do live on an album but still transport the sound to 1972
7600524 they didnt require any hand holding in the studio i set them up explained the process and they just went at it the basic tracks were all performed live for the most part songs like jesus on the mainline and old hound were literally recorded with two mikes in the room and them crowded around a piano or guitar and singing yes theyre that fucking amazing
7600525 im gonna shout til the spirit moves in my heart im gonna shout til jesus comes
7600526 politics at the deepest place is about us as spiritual beings understanding there is a god this is a created world
7600527 we need to remind the rest of the country that there is absolutely in our party a tremendous intersection of faith and politics
7600528 with all due respect to the commentators and my friends in the media
7600529 we didnt need to bring faith to the party faith is already here
7600530 the practice of the death penalty on our own soil has made it easier for us to kill those we designate as enemies
7600531 and now im ready to work here until i die
7600532 lots of elevators play celine dion that dont make it right
7600533 doesnt everyone die at the end of the first one
7600534 he responds that would be a time machine which among other things allows hamlet to hang with jesus christ
7600535 and every monday i drive my truck around the neighborhood looking for old wood and stuff in the bulk trash people put out for pickup
7600536 ive stopped garbage trucks on occasion to fish out chunks of rotting wood also a lot of poor people west of miami avenue toss out some of the antiques i use because they consider them to be old hand me downs and worthless
7600537 mechanical wooden automatons that visitors to the rotting arcade might have screwed
7600538 i also create the sets for my movies do drawings make sculptures props installations play music and take photographs
7600539 mom used to screen a super8 reel of the return of dracula during all my birthdays when i was a kid
7600540 it was funny to walk into the living room and watch mom and other adults cowering with blankets tucked under their chins mom was just obsessed with that movie
7600541 im still trying to get all of the stuff here to locust to use on the project
7600542 but theres a beehive inside the mess now and i cant get to all of it
7600543 i remember the guy going into a convenience store and stuffing himself with twinkies to get the liquor off his breath before the cops came
7600544 when i was a kid i used to have these fever dreams during which an energy ball floated into my room and made me sick
7600545 in the movie otto becomes a beekeeper and is conflicted by a giant beehive which is a substitute for the glowing energy ball i used to dream about

7600831 itulah bulan yang manusia lalai darinya antara rajab dan ramadhan dan merupakan bulan yang di dalamnya diangkat amalan amalan kepada rabbul alamin dan saya menyukai amal saya diangkat sedangkan saya dalam keadaan berpuasa
7600832 kaum muslimin ketika memasuki bulan syaban mereka menekuni pembacaan ayat ayat al quran dan mengeluarkan zakat untuk membantu orang orang yang lemah dan miskin agar mereka bisa menjalankan ibadah puasa ramadhan
7600833 adalah rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam berpuasa sampai kami katakan beliau tidak pernah berbuka dan beliau berbuka sampai kami katakan beliau tidak pernah berpuasa saya tidak pernah melihat rasulullah menyempurnakan puasa satu bulan penuh kecuali ramadhan dan saya tidak pernah melihat beliau berpuasa lebih banyak dari bulan syaban
7600834 wahai asiyah atau wahai humaira apakah kamu menyangka bahwa rasulullah tidak memberikan hakmu kepadamu
7600835 tidak ya rasulallah namun aku menyangka bahwa anda telah dipanggil allah karena sujud anda lama sekali
7600836 ini adalah malam nisfu syaban pertengahan bulan syaban dan allah muncul kepada hamba hamba nya di malam nisfu syaban dan mengampuni orang yang minta ampun mengasihi orang yang minta dikasihi namun menunda orang yang hasud sebagaimana perilaku mereka
7600837 kebanyakan ulama hadits menilai bahwa hadits hadits yang berbicara tentang malam nishfu syaban masuk kategori hadits dloif lemah namun ibn hibban menilai sebagaian hadits itu shohih dan beliau memasukkannya dalam kitab shohihnya
7600838 para ulama hadits ulama fiqh dan ulama ulama lainnya sebagaimana juga dikatakan oleh imam nawawi bersepakat terhadap diperbolehkannya menggunakan hadits dloif untuk keutamaan amal fadloilul amal bukan untuk menentukan hukum selama hadits hadits itu tidak terlalu dloif sangat lemah
7600839 beberapa hadits dan atsar telah diriwayatkan tentang keutamaan malam nisyfu syaban bahwa sekelompok ulama salaf telah melakukan sholat pada malam tersebut
7600840 jika tiba malam nisyfi syaban maka bersholatlah di malam harinya dan berpuasalah di siang harinya karena sesungguhnya allah subhanahu wataala menurunkan rahmatnya pada malam itu ke langit dunia yaitu mulai dari terbenamnya matahari
7600841 doa adalah senjatanya seorang mukmin tiyangnya agama dan cahayanya langit dan bumi
7600842 seorang muslim yang berdoa selama tidak berupa sesuatu yang berdosa dan memutus famili niscaya allah subhanahu wataala menganugrahkan salah satu dari ketiga hal pertama allah akan mengabulkan doanya di dunia kedua allah baru akan mengabulkan doanya di akhirat kelak ketiga allah akan menghindarkannya dari kejelekan lain yang serupa dengan isi doanya
7600843 bahwa saya melihat rasulullah pada malam nishfu syaban melakukan sholat empat belas rekaat setelahnya membaca surat al fatihah 14 x surah al ikhlas 14 x surah al falaq 14 x surah annas 14 x ayat kursi 1 x dan satu ayat terkhir surat at taubah 1 x
7600844 barang siapa yang melakukan apa yang telah kamu saksikan tadi maka dia akan mendapatkan pahala 20 kali haji mabrur puasa 20 tahun dan jika pada saat itu dia berpuasa maka ia seperti berpuasa dua tahun satu tahun yang lalu dan setahun yang akan datang

7600846 hard to avoid the conclusion that sales have bottomed out
7600847 sales have picked up significantly in several florida and california markets home prices generally follow sales trends after a few months of lag time
7600848 while a stabilization in sales might normally be considered a positive development for home values the surge in distressed sales suggests that the downward pressure on house prices is only getting stronger
7600849 over the next few quarters foreclosure sales are likely to comprise an increasing proportion of home sales which should put further downward pressure on home prices
7600850 fundamentals in the housing market remain weak as oversupply falling prices and tighter lending standards continue to weigh on home sales

7601053 we cannot sign an agreement unless it will preserve the sovereignty and national interests of iraq
7601054 any foreign soldiers on iraqi soil must have a specific time frame and not be open ended and iraqi blood must be protected and cannot grant full immunity
7601055 we assure you that nothing will be concealed and that we are at the beginning of the restoration of our full rights and sovereignty and the aspirations of the agreement and security arrangement will be presented to the parliament

7601081 relations between mutambara and mugabe have been good lately its not inconceivable that the two agreed to work together in an attempt to retain control of parliament

7601092 the government forces still surround the camp there is no fighting now but tension is high throughout the camp and no one knows where the wounded people have been taken
7601093 this morning security forces surrounded kalma camp and demanded that every idp internally displaced person leave
7601094 later they opened fire on the eastern side of the camp there were many casualties up to now we have 27 confirmed dead and 75 wounded
7601095 government forces killed 25 idps this happened before the eyes of the hybrid force i urge the international community to protect idps
7601096 the unamid leadership is closely monitoring the situation with serious concern
7601097 we called off regular patrols in kalma because it not part of our mandate to search for arms and arrest individuals
7601098 shortly after we got calls from sheikhs who said those officers had already positioned themselves in the camp and that shots were fired
7601099 a unamid police and military force accessed the camp to assess the situation and we are prepared for possible assistance in the case of evacuating any type of casualties
7601100 i know from ngos working inside kalma that there is fighting inside the camp but they didnt give me details
7601101 we have decided to quit the coalition and sit on the opposition benches in parliament

7601119 we did a lot of base stuff and thats good we wanted to get pressure with our base fronts and whenever you can do that youll be successful
7601120 for some reason everybody was honed in and it paid off whenever you can get a pass rush like today it just makes everybodys job easier
7601121 youre always happy with that kind of production and a lot of different guys were involved
7601122 we were working on some different things with the pressure package and to see those work was positive
7601123 we needed to put more pressure on the quarterback and help the rest of the defense out
7601124 last year we felt like too many times we left them out of the dryer hanging
7601125 not just the sacks he had but he applied some pressure in some other areas
7601126 i dont want to hit all my home runs in the preseason
7601127 it was about us fine tuning as well as we played they still had a couple of big runs on us
7601128 you just want for them to have a good time out here
7601129 its a chance for them to meet professional football players and its a fun time for them i just wanted to say hey and let them know that you can be what you want
7601130 there are different degrees of epilepsy my seizures are labeled petit mal
7601131 i havent had one in a long time but i generally have the urge to go somewhere and ive just got to go im in rush i got to go i dont know where i have to go but i have to go i make fun of myself to make things easier for others especially when im talking to kids
7601132 the one time i walked to high school and thank goodness i didnt wear pajamas i had some sleep shorts and an old ratty shirt
7601133 i lived about two miles from high school and i walked there one morning really early and a buddy looked at me in the hallway and was kind of like what are you doing
7601134 i was like im going home i clicked right out of it went home and changed and then came right back to school
7601135 i take six pills a day two pills three times a day every day
7601136 as long as im on my medication im fine if i forget to take it for several doses i would have a seizure
7601137 when you tell someone you have epilepsy the first thing they think of is what they see in movies
7601138 they see the guy hitting the ground having the grand mal seizure and they just dont know there are so many different forms of epilepsy there are different forms and people are able to play professional football
7601139 i plan to help and get the word out my daughter anabelle kathryn has epilepsy as well shes 3 years old
7601140 we have completely separate issues so its a little ironic but we both have epilepsy and im definitely looking to improve her world as well
7601141 we brought a bunch of people out to training camp i went to the events and i went to the walks
7601142 i just tried to be a voice in the epilepsy community i did stuff during epilepsy awareness month just lots of things to get the message out to make people aware of me in my situation and by doing that alleviating the stereotype of people with epilepsy
7601143 i think the best thing for kids with epilepsy to do is to just be open about it especially because if something does happen your friends need to know they need to be able to tell the paramedics
7601144 id like to have that opportunity to make that decision ive been asked that question a lot the answer is i dont know
7601145 youd like to go in and play like the other night and maybe get some more plays and be as successful
7601146 but what if youre not do you keep trying to gain that success and in the process something bad happens i dont know i think its kind of a touchy situation based on how much ive played or havent played i would think i would play more
7601147 sometimes we play them through the half and dont bring them out in third quarter
7601148 sometimes we bring them out in the third quarter i dont really have it set this year is a little bit different
7601149 its a bigger game for us in the preseason its a great test for us
7601150 we get to go against the world champions and see how we measure up and it will be fun
7601151 i dont know if you circle the date but its pretty much your last shot at getting some gametime readiness for that opener
7601152 lets get on the same page and kind of get that game 1 sense of whats going on lets approach it that way
7601153 they were really impressive against cleveland and they have some really good athletes in the front seven
7601154 we feel like we are a pretty good group up front and its going to be a really good test guys are definitely looking forward to it
7601155 potential is definitely a scary word but i feel like we have the ingredients to be really good up front the whole key is we just have to continue to work at it
7601156 as you know the offensive line is really the one position that takes longer to jell than any other position on the football team but we have a bunch of hard working guys
7601157 they do a lot of stuff in terms of their zone blitz packages
7601158 the types of zone blitz are not all just the post safety zone blitzes theres some split safety cover 2 theres some split safety cover 4 there are multiple looks and ways that they pressure and then when they just bring the four down guys they can cause problems too
7601159 i keep saying it but when guys can communicate without communicating up front its really big and its really when you start to do things beyond xs and os
7601160 you start to be able to pick up the tough blitzes and the tough looks the defenses give you and not just make it a wash youre able to still take advantage of it as if you drew it up that way
7601161 infosys believes that the acquisition will accelerate the achievement of some of infosys current strategic corporate objectives including the continued expansion of infosys consulting capabilities
7601162 the leak from a democratic official up ended whatever power sms and email might have wrested from traditional media as a mass communication tool in politics
7601163 the obama campaign planned to do a first for sms and it didnt happen
7601164 if the leak was authorized which seems likely since cable news networks and news outlets were confirming the news directly within minutes did the obama campaign abandon the first of its kind plan to break the news via sms and email or did it simply fail on the backend
7601165 anytime something you love to do is taken away and you dont have the opportunity to do it anymore its a humbling experience
7601166 but i can tell you if a guy can hit tackle run and cover those things are apparent and i liked the things he was doing there
7601167 ive got this opportunity here and i have to make the most of it
7601168 to tell you the truth this might be my last chance in the league
7601169 he told me to approach the situation and handle it like a man
7601170 he said if you dont learn from your mistakes the same things are going to happen again and again
7601171 i had to get with the coaches and learn the defense a little more and get comfortable so far thats been going well and im getting better bit by bit
7601172 hes a joy to be around and one of the funniest people ive ever met
7601173 sometimes youre not even sure if its a joke right away hell look dead serious when he says some of the goofy stuff and thats part of the humor itself
7601174 i felt more at ease in the huddle i felt more at ease on the field i felt more like myself
7601175 when we have 12 penalties and 11 of them are on offensive players thats an issue
7601176 thats something that we have to do a much better job on this weeks point of emphasis was to have the tackles up on the line and that was something we knew was going to be an issue and we shouldve done a better job with that
7601177 sometimes you think about the mistake longer than you should
7601178 as i came out of the game i felt pretty good about how i played some of the reads i made and some of the throws i made
7601179 i feel like my arms in great shape i scrambled for a first down i dont move as well as i used to but i was able to use my feet and bail myself out a little bit
7601180 we had some big plays unfortunately they were called back
7601181 all we have to do is watch the film to see that we have a lot of potential it just goes to show you how little things lead to big things there are things that can be corrected that can be corrected very quickly but you cant win making those kinds of mistakes
7601182 its always good to go out there get your sacks and be in rhythm
7601183 ill present my side ill say hey id love to play a series two series whatever
7601184 if he mangini says its not worth it then so be it
7601185 ok guys im going to let you sit out this game but i want you to practice
7601186 heck if im going to practice im going to play at least a series
7601187 i was thinking there would be more comments against my position but ive been surprised at how many people are against the cops behavior and whatnot
7601188 ive been pretty amazed with the comments that ive been reading especially from other web pages law offices and people that are ex law enforcement

7601202 we are turning the heat up on idol this year and are thrilled to welcome kara to the judges table
7601203 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7601204 we had originally intended for american idol to have four judges
7601205 weve seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers
7601206 that transparency sort of gives some added urgency for all hospitals to continue to focus on quality people are going to look at those numbers and react to those numbers and make decisions

7601216 some people have told me and told you that i will breach the constitution
7601217 they climbed rooftops to tell me that we must follow the constitution as the way forward i understand
7601218 i also understand that the constitution should be a living and breathing document which could be modified to change if there is an emerging consensus to do so
7601219 the pacific island countries will need to be vigilant to protect the forum organisation becoming a foreign policy tool of these two countries
7601220 they now seem to have usurped the moral leadership of the region
7601221 and thats been our stand we have been very consistent in supporting the commitments he has made to the 2007 forum in tonga
7601222 so this is not australia and new zealand this is the forums stand that we continue to urge him to meet the commitment that he has pledged
7601223 that kind of mental attitude from bainimarama does not help his cause
7601224 what he is doing is ridiculing the independence and integrity of all the members of the forum
7601225 die leichen waren so hei dass wir uns beim wegtragen die finger verbrannten
7601226 i hope we will be able to meet and discuss issues affecting the people the country and the vanua
7601227 the people country vanua and the church are in the hands of the lord
7601228 it was not my decision but the decision of the members through the guidance of the holy spirit
7601229 and now that i have being elected president i ask for the support of all members because the church is not mine or the peoples it is gods
7601230 we need to work together so that we can receive gods blessing in doing his work
7601231 even after my term as president the church will continue and working together and praying will keep the church intact
7601232 i feel great and am happy because my superior reverend ame tugaue is a close friend
7601233 it is going to be challenging because the church does not belong to the conference but to god
7601234 having that in mind we have to find gods purpose
7601235 we have to be clear with the vision of the church and the corporate plan of the church
7601236 it shows that the people have concerted minds to trust me
7601237 under the general secretary there are many secretaries like secretary education evangelism social services and christian citizenship lay pastor women fellowship men fellowship and young peoples department
7601238 all these secretaries are under the wings of the general secretary
7601239 he controls the running of the headquarters of the church and sits with the president and they work closely together
7601240 there are almost 4000 members in the armed forces based around europe
7601241 the young men and women faced the same problems as youths here like the abuse of alcohol
7601242 many of them have just come out of high school and joined the armed forces some have moved there from the villages and they dont know what to do with the money they earn especially when a lot of things are cheap
7601243 i think there is a need for ministers to go and join young men and women who join the army in britain and europe where they are based
7601244 we had church services where those based in england came together
7601245 i met a lot of our young men and men serving in the army
7601246 in the fiji islands higher prices are on top of a range of rising pressures on the most vulnerable such as reduced access to land and loss of jobs in manufacturing
7601247 the rapid increase in world prices and the likelihood that these prices will remain high for some time indicate a strong need to assist the pacific adjust to the new conditions
7601248 the technical assistance will provide recommendations on the next steps to help the region respond and cope with high global prices
7601249 we have got to work out a financing plan with gmac or another company
7601250 there are no plans to close the columbus bill heard dealership
7601251 we are looking to sell a couple of the other dealerships around the country so as to diversify into other brands
7601252 we dont comment on any actions we take with any particular dealer
7601253 it is gmacs practice to regularly review credit risks related to wholesale financing and taking action to appropriately mitigate risk
7601254 the typical reason for gmac yanking credit is the store is out of trust
7601255 there are less cars on the lots than there should be
7601256 which means they are not reporting all of the sales many times they are accumulating gmacs money to buy used cars or maybe pay off bills

7601259 upon returning we were fortunate that a close family member joe browne looked after her at waila with his wife who is a doctor
7601260 for this the family is deeply thankful to mr browne and his wife the good doctor
7601261 her body will lie in state at the family home at vuniduva on friday for the whole day and night before a church service at somosomo and then her body will be taken to the family burial ground at vuniduva
7601262 i will miss her advice and company and having somebody there for companion as we were are a very close family
7601263 she had been a part of my life for a long time and we all felt it when she left us for india
7601264 but we got used to it because she has been sick for a long time
7601265 two days later maff paid repina wholesalers a cheque of one cent more than the previous cheque by examination of the documents there was no accounting reason for the payment
7601266 once that arrives we hope to fix the problem and have the nadi hospital laundry up and operating
7601267 this is part of our contingency plan as these are electrical machines and are prone to give up along the way as they are used daily
7601268 there have been several robbery cases around town but somehow they have escaped detection by police officers on the beat
7601269 these were not small robberies they involved thousands of dollars and more so we were quite baffled when we brought in a suspect he confessed to receiving help from the officers who he claims told him to rob which shop and at certain time and the officers got their cut from it

7601271 all our school children should be protected from any form of abuse as stated in the convention on the right of a child this in simple language means that all forms of punishment against children should stop
7601272 you and other teachers who are assigned to deal with school discipline should be constantly reminded that assaulting children under your care is totally unacceptable you are aware too of the consequential effects of this offence and how it would affect your noble profession
7601273 what he is doing is ridiculing the independence and integrity of all the members of the forum
7601274 it is better for the fiji military regime to know exactly to understand the thinking of the forum leaders
7601275 i dont know whether they will accept me when i am released
7601276 do they still see me as a killer who does not deserve a life outside prison
7601277 i am thankful for the yellow ribbon program but i feel it depends on the minds of people how they look at us
7601278 im so sad that one of my students had to go this way
7601279 he will surely be missed since he was involved in all our school functions such as our graduation on thursday
7601280 for 30 years we have treated the water source area as sacred and have forbidden its use but if they dont pay then we might as well use it for farming so that we can at least make some money out of it
7601281 we have been good to them and yet little has come back the landowners way in return
7601282 mr robbins told us that water belonged to god we agree but the area could be using for farming but was not being used because of the water source that the resort was using to make millions of dollars from
7601283 the sacked workers could not speak freely in their presence so there really was no need for them to be there
7601284 so we demanded that they leave because they were a menacing presence
7601285 we demanded to know what mr robbins would do about the situation
7601286 but unfortunately our views were never heard mr robbins only came and told us he found no fault with resort management
7601287 show once again that pg was unable to reduce its losses in fiji
7601288 given the track record of the past four years since the november 4 fire it is apparent that we may continue to lose money until the primary manufacturing operation can be rebuilt
7601289 and our inability to manufacture quality export products for the south pacific area these factors resulted in a loss for our fiji operation of 62 530 it should also be noted that these losses also contain significant statutory community and legal costs
7601290 the profits from china were sufficient to balance the fiji books and resulted in a small group profit of 38 938 group income decreased to 3 194 696 2007 3 727 320
7601291 the officers understand that for the program to be successful they need to be at the forefront we have to be visible supporters if we want the community to believe in the merits of what we have instigated
7601292 our off duty officers go out with the combined team co ordinated by the lautoka city council i commend my officers for their support they know that this is about them the prisoners society they know it is for a bigger cause
7601293 our theme for the week is to reach out and touch as many lives as we can and we intend to do just that
7601294 even though they were sick they gave us a smile and that taught me something new
7601295 i cant go out to see them at the grounds so i am really glad they came here
7601296 they all looked really beautiful and they brought flowers and balloons
7601297 we support the yellow ribbon program and the effort to integrate prisoners back into society
7601298 we want to show them that people care labasa community cares

7601457 i think upshaw will be positively remembered except for certain owners who always want to return to the good old days which werent so good
7601458 a number of our owners are concerned with many aspects of the labor deal thats something we need to improve

7601460 leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
7601461 few people in the history of the nfl have played the game as well as gene and then had another career in football with so much positive impact on the structure and competitiveness of the entire league
7601462 in both careers if you hit him hard he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so he was very tough but also a good listener

7601476 rats have destroyed food and crops largely in areas along the indo burmese border lines but in many other parts drought has brought severe difficulties for farmers
7601477 though we could not confirm of the deaths it is very much possible because people in some villages have lost all of their food stocks and are dependent on jungle fruits and roots
7601478 in some of the cornfields nothing is left but the stems of the corn
7601479 the reports we have received tell us that the situation is grave as indeed the rats have destroyed crops and continue to impact on the future food security of people living in those townships particularly in the western more remote parts of the state kaye said

7601622 ive come to see iraqis feel happy its wonderful to see people smile
7601623 weve had only misery but we need to be happy this is the first time that i forget everything can you distinguish a shiite from a sunni no they are all iraqis
7601624 after the savagery and sectarian violence today i see iraqis
7601625 this is the first ive come to the capital and i see other iraqis like me
7601626 it gives me immense pleasure to play before this crowd
7601627 we played an important role in establishing diplomatic relations between syria and lebanon
7601628 we can help in solving them not by interfering but at the request of both countries
7601629 all he heard about the hopes difficulties and wishes of all the lebanese to live in an independent democratic and sovereign lebanon
7601630 i have noted the goodwill in continuing this process by setting a date for an exchange of ambassadors which will be before the end of the year im happy about that
7601631 one must always take threats seriously both those made by israel and by mr nasrallah because this is a very inflammatory region
7601632 a policeman assigned to guard the archangel michael church in deshasha beni soueif province south of cairo hit three women while they were taking sand into the church to fix the floor which was cracked as result of water collection underneath
7601633 the worrying rise in sectarian tension that we have seen in deshasha is a direct result of violations committed by the police
7601634 this incident must be investigated and those responsible held accountable
7601635 the archangel michael church in deshasha is but one example of the futility of any efforts to reform and unify construction and renovation laws for places of worship so long as security agents continue to violate existing laws in a discriminatory manner and with complete impunity

7601656 carry on vaccinating until we find out why vaccines are killing cats and which cats are most likely to die
7601657 examples are the encephalitides following measles chickenpox rubella smallpox vaccination vaccinia and many other less well defined viral infections
7601658 our ongoing studies of dogs show that following routine vaccination there is a significant rise in the level of antibodies dogs produce against their own tissues some of these antibodies have been shown to target the thyroid gland connective tissue such as that found in the valves of the heart red blood cells dna etc i do believe that the heart conditions in cavalier king charles spaniels could be the end result of repeated immunizations by vaccine s containing tissue culture contaminants that cause a progressive immune response directed at connective tissue in the heart valves the clinical manifestations would be more pronounced in dogs that have a genetic predisposition the findings should be generally applicable to all dogs regardless of their breed
7601659 many veterinarians trace the present problems with allergic and immunologic diseases to the introduction of mlv vaccines
7601660 i think that vaccines are leading killers of dogs and cats in america today
7601661 homoeopathic veterinarians and other holistic practitioners have maintained for some time that vaccinations do more harm than they provide benefits
7601662 in response to this violation there have been increased autoimmune diseases allergies being one component epilepsy neoplasia as well as behavioural problems in small animals
7601663 cancer has been described as the wound that never heals

7601675 if people would actually watch the show instead of making innane comments here and there i feel really good about the show sometimes peoples interest in me obscures the work that were doing which is a disservice to everyone
7601676 i think sexism theres still an attitude of locker room banter thats cute and funny and acceptable we saw that especially on the cable stations
7601677 i think sometimes the coverage of me is definitely sexist i dont think the ratings are indicative of sexism although research has shown some people dont feel that comfortable having a woman do the evening news so it could be a contributing factor sometimes i feel in the coverage of it it rears its ugly head

7601711 we would be looking for four people and we came back with 80
7601712 id have to have my interrogation strategy approved by my section chief
7601713 by the chief of the interrogation center by a psychologist and by the lawyers from the jag corps
7601714 went into a description of an electronic database i had never heard of
7601715 the chief said the pentagon somehow believes we have a database that doesnt exist
7601716 interrogators often get detainees with little or no information along with them and even after they are interrogated there is little feedback to help the interrogators know whether the detainees were honest in their statements
7601717 interrogators and analysts alike rarely get information about follow on operations based on their work again making it impossible to evaluate how theyre doing further when units send a detainee to be interrogated they rarely get the results so they dont know whether they got a bad guy or somebody who was in the wrong place at the wrong time
7601718 we had to have an actionable intelligence report of everyone we interrogated
7601719 people started writing in the reports 5 foot 8 arab male in eastern falluja works with the mujahideen
7601720 in this war they only want to hear they got the right guy even if he is the wrong guy
7601721 this is a really bad way to do business as the impact on the population is pretty heavy it creates many more insurgent recruits as fast as we can throw them into camp bucca
7601722 human rights watch shares the concern of the u n assistance mission in iraq that many detainees are held for lengthy periods without judicial review and under review processes that do not meet international standards of due process as applicable during a non international armed conflict
7601723 military interrogation is not like police interrogation where knowledge of all aspects of the case is key
7601724 i know it sounds illogical but its for operational security
7601725 the u s military had thousands of people into the detention system at any given moment and there werent enough interrogators to follow any particular strand to its conclusion
7601726 sometimes this needle in the haystack method works sometimes we get lucky but as a grand strategy its not a great one
7601727 there continues to be a massive problem with intelligence collection analysis and dissemination in the u s operation in iraq
7601728 everyone tends to err on the side of detention to the detriment of classic counter insurgency doctrine not to mention basic communication and common sense
7601729 i kept encountering things that put my duty and my job in conflict with my faith
7601730 you call yourself a christian but you dont do what christ does you dont turn the other cheek
7601731 the most important people in my life have been prisoners jesus dietrich bonhoffer the apostle paul it was then that i had broken objectivity
7601732 i think this is the first time a set has sold for 1 million
7601733 by selecting joe biden for vice president barack obama has shown voters that not even gov tim kaine can hide the fact that he is out of touch with the core values held by the hard working families of virginia
7601734 barack obama has sent virginia voters the message by choosing sen joe biden as his running mate that he just wasnt seeing the momentum in virginia that he had hoped barack obama spent two full days campaigning in virginia and his message is not resonating
7601735 congratulations to my friend and colleague in the u s senate joe biden for being selected as barack obamas running mate however i am confident as virginians continue to get to know barack obamas record and counterproductive proposals they will see he is out of touch with the core values and issues most important to our families
7601736 its clear that barack obama is nervous about this election because he is obviously compensating for his significant lack of experience obama has selected a running mate who doesnt believe he is ready to be president and so i guess even obama himself is concerned that three years out of the illinois state senate is hardly enough to prepare one to be commander in chief and the leader of the free world
7601737 i remain convinced that virginia will vote for john mccain he is the only candidate who has the background knowledge and experience to lead our country at a critical time in our history and he is the only candidate who has put forth positive solutions on important issues such as national security economic security and energy security i look forward to campaigning with sen mccain to victory here in virginia this november
7601738 this is a ticket that believes in higher taxes more government inaction in the face of rising energy prices and that fundamentally fails to understand the true nature of the enemies we face abroad
7601739 the contrast between an obama biden ticket and the candidacy of john mccain could not be more stark or more important john mccain believes that lowering taxes is the best way to strengthen the economy and create jobs in virginia while barack obama already voted for higher taxes on virginia families
7601740 i will not listen to you right now i will discuss these things when you are calmer and there is less unbloggability or potential for rather none has occurred thus far since i have started refusing to escalate with him in your eyes and at your lips because it will be damaging for me and i cannot afford to be hurt right now

7601750 to all of our family and friends we are pleased to announce that our little princess anja louise ambrosio mazur was born on sunday august 24 at 7 32 p m she is 6 3 pounds 2 86 kilograms and absolutely perfect
7601751 she hasnt cried once except for a second when they pulled her out we have now felt a new kind of love and joy that we never knew existed

7601753 among the 38 comments posted to that item and sent via e mail was the suggestion that we make it easier to find romenesko from elsewhere on the site
7601754 we paid attention we made jim part of the main navigation of the site since then about 1 100 people have joined our alpha group many of them chiming in with suggestions
7601755 we were overdue weve added a lot of content to the site since we last did a significant redesign nearly six years ago weve been hearing from people for a long time that theres a lot of valuable stuff on the site but they have a lot of trouble actually finding it weve tried to address that with a cleaner clearer design and navigation weve also introduced advertising both help wanted ads for journalists and display ads and needed to do a better job incorporating those ads in our pages
7601756 this is the third major redesign of my page and its safe to say that all of them were heavily criticized when launched many readers loved this version of my site and screamed when it was updated which is hard to believe now
7601757 we hope readers users will appreciate the improvements and feedback so far indicates that a lot of them do
7601758 we know we cant please everybody though and will do our best to listen to critics especially critics with specific issues or suggestions

7601766 the best thing about bernie is that he was happiest when the people around him were happy thats a real testament to the kind of generosity that he had
7601767 i did his show and my character had all of the laugh lines and i had all of the flashy things to do and i said hey bernie is this cool
7601768 i think thats a real testament to who bernie was he shined when everybody else shined he was really generous
7601769 it was very emotional when he brother came up to me and said my sister was named selena and i said i was named after her it was a really powerful moment

7601835 we have been overwhelmed in both good and bad ways over the past 24 hours with the amount of interest in photosynth
7601836 same happened to me got to publishing synth and wouldnt go further
7601837 then my computer had to reboot and when it came back up and i started synth again it didnt show the synth i had made
7601838 note that any synths in progress when we go down will need to be repeated

7601861 i was actually leaning toward him early on mike fisher told the swamp

7601869 as a dok i could solo 2 3 guys in lower level renown gear 1 2 guys in equal gear depending on class and hold my own even against bright wizards and the paladin archtype
7601870 pvp in this game is very group oriented you need your frontline to detaunt and debuff your enemies before they go for your squishys a chosen and a dok can hold off 4 5 people indefinately letting your dps classes wittle them down
7601871 the assit train in this game is crucile as a dok no class could effectivly solo me combat is much too slow to be able to burst down a class who can heal themselves indefinately but in comes the assit train
7601872 even a r10 rr6 chosen will go down to lowbies under properly focused fire
7601873 there is so much more as i only hit r15 rr10 this weekend with the r14 rr8 gear
7601874 for example 4 of us a chosen dok witch elf and sorc steamrolled a whole order pug because it is a well balanced group with the chosen and i up front taking midigating fire while the sorc and we just went to town
7601875 i think pvp in war and any open world pvp in any mmo for that fact is zerg based with very little real strategy
7601876 meanwhile the whole time the rest of our group is safely capping the objectives handling the troll pacifier etc
7601877 there are also subtle things like being able to permasnare people so it would be in their best interest to turn and fight you then continue on to their initial target the ability to taunt knockback knockdown
7601878 true there are no aoe mezzes that last 30 secs but there are lots of little aoe cc abilities that can easily change the course of battle
7601879 i found in scenrios much skill was required i played a runepriest with my friend being an ironbreaker we were taking down people in 2v4 fights and i had to los the hell out of people
7601880 they always zerged me the healer i didnt get frustrated i just found a big rock to run around in circles i often changed paths and jumped up on the rock and ran around all over casters never got to do anything but instant spells on me if i saw a csater i never let him have los on me and as for melee my ib friend can snare and kb them to keep them far enough from me why i ran around the rock in circles
7601881 thing i noticed was alot of the players in the scenrios i was in that alot of the players was playing like they where in a wow bg but they soon started learning that team work was the way to win keeping the healers alive and using cd to our advantage
7601882 there is so much more as i only hit r15 rr10 this weekend with the r14 rr8 gear
7601883 thing i noticed was alot of the players in the scenrios i was in that alot of the players was playing like they where in a wow bg but they soon started learning that team work was the way to win keeping the healers alive and using cd to our advantage

7601890 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time
7601891 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
7601892 a natural step for me in my passion for transit

7601901 so for us its kind of amazing and i think for everybody its kind of amazing
7601902 its humbling we handle compost things spill theres a lot of running
7601903 these are people i would never ever ever talk to even in a social situation
7601904 but you have to go up to them and ask do you want chicken or the vegetarian option and when you start talking to them that way when youre getting them their coffee and their dessert a natural sort of conversation starts happening

7601908 only the speaker can bring us back and set the agenda and im afraid well come back and do something that sells the american people short well address the politics but not the problem we need a real debate across a broad spectrum of energy issues to get real solutions for the american people
7601909 i met with some folks back in iowa who are building a coal fired power plant
7601910 we did a survey in our office on energy we got back 3 000 responses three times more response than on any issue weve ever surveyed all were saying to speaker pelosi is bring comprehensive energy solutions to the house floor lets have a debate republicans want the american energy act if we cant have that then just bring an energy bill with an open rule lets put the facts and figures on the floor and lets have a vote
7601911 a constituent of mine from bibb county alabama showed me a gas receipt for their car it was 89 the average income for people in bibb county is 312 a week today the average american is paying 2 000 a year more for energy than they did last year enough is enough we need relief congress should come back and pass an energy bill
7601912 think about the money we are sending overseas to saudi arabia to venezuela to nigeria and on and on and then think about the u s fortune 500 companies that are being bought with your gas money the right thing to do os to have an up or down vote on energy right here on the house floor

7601919 epicentrul a fost in tibet seismul a fost simtit pana in nepal si new delhi
7601920 now its time to pick up the pieces and move forward
7601921 you know i had a lovely memory about sally yesterday do you want to hear it
7601922 the compassionate friends is about transforming the pain of grief into the elixir of hope it takes people out of the isolation society imposes on the bereaved and lets them express their grief naturally with the shedding of tears healing comes and the newly bereaved get to see people who have survived and are learning to live and love again
7601923 by then even the best of friends have moved on and away into their own lives
7601924 that is why i sometimes wait weeks to send a sympathy card and sympathy letter when someone dies i want the bereaved to know that caring is still out there for them
7601925 the whole idea of a roll call vote could be in flux at this point
7601926 the clinton people here theyve said they wanted catharsis they wanted that roll call but they may not get it
7601927 they dont want to be blamed for any trouble at this convention
7601928 it was a privilege to be out there with the starting group
7601929 i gave all i could give out there and thats what i was hoping to go out and do
7601930 i think you have to give guys opportunities to make plays and we did that
7601931 its obviously big when you lose somebody like kevin who had 77 catches last year and then you dont have your other top receiver in reggie brown
7601932 it just feels like the children are being short changed
7601933 this red tape should have been dealt with a long time ago we shouldnt be finding out two weeks before school starts
7601934 undergone several transitions in the past few months including rollover and elimination
7601935 while this is no excuse it is an explanation of the challenges faced by the district during this transition period
7601936 this isnt the first time where weve been in a situation where weve had to deal with the issue of being short on space
7601937 were not going to let a setback change our instruction
7601938 parents are so weary of hearing excuses from this district and why it doesnt perform for our children
7601939 and yet were asked to constantly support the school financially and with volunteer hours its just ridiculous
7601940 its still just kind of hard to believe no one did anything about it
7601941 nobody really knows what they are paying they dont know about the picking up fee or the foreign exchange differentiation
7601942 new entrants say it is very hard to balance compliance with new entry
7601943 the cost of transfers is a concern and also the interest rates imposed by banks on developing countries
7601944 a year from now i dont believe we will be having this problem in the pacific

7601963 what the hell are you doing are you putting a bug on my phone
7601964 how many hotel rooms have i been in the past four years it was so obvious
7601965 have there been any other episodes that would make you believe this kind of action is being taken against you
7601966 not since ive been running for congress but there were several times when i was in crawford or protesting in d
7601967 i believe the momentum is definitely on our side especially the last couple weeks with our signature drive
7601968 after protesting the republicans for so many years the democrats have been moving steadily to the right we want to show that were not okay with that that we want to bring the party closer to the people and further from the corporate lobbyists

7601977 i was probably the most visible hillary supporter there was
7601978 she didnt win i can accept that and i think most people are accepting that
7601979 bottom line we as a party cant afford another bush kind of term
7601980 i liked hillary i saw what she went through with the republicans and she didnt cave in
7601981 but i am not about to vote republican because she isnt the nominee

7601985 sometimes the age of a player helps with their recovery
7601986 we have to let the physios do their job properly
7601987 does this mean we have to wait a bit longer before we get out of this how do they expect us to survive as you can see we only get power at night and our cellphone network is always down
7601988 people have no money cotton is our major cash cow but this year things did not work well its now affecting even other businesses for example fruit and vegetable vendors are forced to sell their stuff at uneconomic prices because very few people can afford the high prices being charged elsewhere people just do not have money
7601989 i came here last week to withdraw some money from the bank i realised the first withdrawal was not enough for bus fare so i decided to hang around for a few days to make a few more withdrawals it appears all the money will be finished on transport as fares have gone up before i finished withdrawing i wont be able to buy any groceries
7601990 before the elections we were told that we would get food aid we are now being told the organisations that were supposed to give us food have been told to wait pending the finalisation of some issues the bacossi basic commodities supply side intervention we got from government is now finished
7601991 when these talks started we were told that we were now supposed to reconcile with the people who were harassing us in the run up to the presidential run off
7601992 i have met him many times but he hasnt bothered even to greet me
7601993 generally there has been a significant decrease in violent activity there are still some pockets of violence here and there but the situation is much calmer now
7601994 together with other pastors weve been holding community outreaches preaching the gospel of forgiveness and reconciliation as prescribed in the scriptures in some cases the message appears to be falling on deaf ears as the people now hate each other with a passion but there are many instances where we have made great strides bringing rivals to the same table and having them share a meal
7601995 the deal is not sustainable and it is not going to solve the crisis the country is experiencing at least it provides a starting point for a settlement but its certainly not the solution
7601996 i was thinking about commissioning a study saying that im a size 2 supermodel

7602002 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here that they were elected to represent
7602003 that however they decide to vote we will all be united behind senator obama
7602004 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7602005 it would have been the same way if i had won and barack was here supporting the unity of the party
7602006 this was a hard fought campaign and there was a lot of intensity and passion associated with it in part because of the historic nature of our two candidacies
7602007 even before the convention and even before the complete reconciliation that we need
7602008 environmentally this is madness it takes up to a quarter of a litre of oil and nine litres of water to produce every one litre of bottled water
7602009 we are lucky enough to have access to some of the best tap water in the world but we still drink millions of bottles of water each year
7602010 employers staff and the public need to get wise to their water footprint and get green stay healthy and hydrated by making the switch to tap water
7602011 when we do go to town for a drink and come back with our friends we have a bit of a drink back at the house and put the music on
7602012 they could have had the decency to knock on the door and say look youre being a bit too much
7602013 this shows that salford council can and will take action against anti social residents regardless of whether they are private social tenants or homeowners there are a range of powers available that we can use
7602014 we are grateful for the support of the police in securing this injunction and for acting as key witnesses to this case
7602015 we encourage residents to report nuisance neighbours people need not suffer in silence
7602016 in one human lifetime our industrial landscape has changed beyond recognition
7602017 the citys re birth came about not as a result of german bombs but its own evolution
7602018 so basically britains industrial strength is caught in these dossiers
7602019 a hundred years ago trafford park was considered the future
7602020 in this short space of time this vision has vanished and what we see today is a rise of a different kind of economy alongside the m62 motorway what little remained of the old deer park has been transformed into one of europes largest shopping centres

7602023 self consciously the city has re invented itself leaving its industrial past behind factories have been replaced by leisure and culture
7602024 the working class way of life in victorian terraced housing has been turned into a primetime soap opera
7602025 but perhaps the biggest certainly the tallest statement of manchesters new aspirations is the beetham tower rising 48 storeys into the sky over the city centre
7602026 there was nobody living here clearly it had to change otherwise it would die
7602027 people were simply leaving the city if they had any money the only people left here were those who couldnt get out and were trying to reverse that now make it an attractive place a building like this is all about signalling that ambition and changing perception of the city internationally
7602028 vi har set historier om at folk med insiderviden har handlet aktier og der er en risiko for at den viden har v ret brugt til insiderhandler og at man derfor har beriget sig p andres bekostning jeg vurderer at der b r v re basis for at man f r politiet til at unders ge forholdene

7602034 the storm is trying to pull the market higher but its not getting much of a boost
7602035 from the caribbean to the caspian weve had one bullish headline after another and the market cannot generate a sustained rally
7602036 it certainly doesnt bode well for anyone who owns commodities
7602037 we continue to see little chance for oil to be used by russia as a bargaining tool
7602038 oil is the weapon of last resort not of first resort and it would make no sense for russia to limit exports of crude or products to european countries
7602039 we are not convinced that the government needs to take any action over the near term
7602040 we will not easily arrest people if they dont break any law
7602041 the persecution of religious believers is very much alive in china and ongoing regardless of the fact that the olympics games has just been held in china
7602042 apple knows about the problem but insists it isnt an issue because no one has complained publicly
7602043 there was no police no crash no paparazzi chase etc just very incorrect reports via internet gossip sites
7602044 we got a lot of situations covered we scored touchdowns we found the end zone and a lot of our young receivers stood up and made some catches i thought hartline and cobb quarterbacks mike hartline and randall cobb handled the offense well and made some plays
7602045 we had much better protection today by the offensive line we had a couple of breakdowns that would have been sacks as we did not allow the quarterbacks to be hit today there were some good runs made and some holes there was some push moving the pile a little bit it looked more like i thought it was going to look today than it did last week
7602046 i feel like corey peters myron pryor and ricky lumpkin are loads inside and we have some other young guys doing some decent things but those three guys are the real deal inside
7602047 theyre going to give everybody a test certainly theyve given us a test in fall camp
7602048 its a little scary obviously when you go against yourself you never know whos doing something good and whos doing something not so good because youre going against yourself there were a lot of good individual plays today we looked like we were not quite as quick as we need to be a little beat up tired dead legged we have a light practice tomorrow and a day off monday we start our normal morning practices on tuesday we need to freshen up and get some bounce back in our step now
7602049 our decision that this referendum meets the constitutional requirements as to subject matter does not mean that it has our support but simply that the constitutional requirements are met for the proponents of the referendum to obtain further signatures
7602050 i saw when the judges blatantly stole fights from two cuban boxers in the semifinals
7602051 our fighters had hopes of winning despite the judges but it was useless they were condemned beforehand

7602053 there will be european chauvinism judge corruption buying of brawn and brains and a strong dose of racism
7602054 economics is not something ive understood as well as i should
7602055 barack obama has proposed raising taxes on small businesses and americas working families during an economic downturn you dont have to know much to understand that barack obamas plans to raise taxes will hurt an already struggling economy and its particularly revealing that the obama campaign feels forced to cast flimsy attack ads during his own convention
7602056 every one of us could stand up and recite all the reasons why we must elect barack the supreme court is at stake our educational system needs the right kind of change weve got to become energy independent we have to create millions of new green collar jobs weve got so much work to do around the world
7602057 none of that will happen if john mccain is in the white house i just want to make it absolutely clear we cannot afford four more years of george w bushs failed policies in america and thats what we would get with john mccain
7602058 now i understand that the mccain campaign is running ads trying to divide us and let me state what i think about their tactics and these ads i am hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7602059 senator mccain will bring a lifetime of experience to the campaign i will bring a lifetime of experience and senator obama will bring a speech he gave in 2002
7602060 if obama loses our children will grow up thinking of equal opportunity as a myth
7602061 his defeat would say that when handed a perfect opportunity to put the worst part of our history behind us we chose not to in this event the worlds judgment will be severe and inescapable the united states had its day but in the end couldnt put its own self interest ahead of its crazy irrationality over race
7602062 with so many of hillary clintons most ardent supporters in denver is the political press corps here in danger of over hyping obamas problem with hillary backers
7602063 if obama loses our children will grow up thinking of equal opportunity as a myth
7602064 of course mccain doesnt want to win this way because if he only wins based on backlash then he may have trouble governing
7602065 if obama loses our children will grow up thinking of equal opportunity as a myth
7602066 if obama loses our children will grow up thinking of equal opportunity as a myth
7602067 this is how democrats blow elections when they talk down to voters
7602068 im a staunch democrat and card carrying union member im voting for mccain and i dont feel bad about it my politics fit much more closely with mccain then obama
7602069 the thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine
7602070 he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
7602071 ill have my staff get back to you on that one

7602101 if you have enough invadopodia over time theyll make large holes that cells can move through to invade and metastasize
7602102 we thought that more stuff for the cells to get through was going to make it harder so we expected to see less matrix degradation but instead we found cells actually sense the rigidity and degrade more
7602103 the beginning of power sharing not by consensus but by issue of the electoral weight
7602104 it gives them a significant amount of power to build the legislative assembly into a strong force for accountability one which is really going to force the executive mugabe to find a way to work with a parliament which may be led by hostile forces

7602121 the protesters participated in tibet independence activities and that is against chinas law
7602122 the relevant countries will teach their citizens to abide and respect chinas laws
7602123 we encourage the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights including freedom of expression and freedom of religion of all people during the olympic games and beyond
7602124 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7602125 i never dreamed i would walk again after i was wounded i forgot what its like
7602126 only when standing up can i feel how tall i really am and speak to people eye to eye not from below
7602127 it raises people out of their wheelchair and lets them stand up straight
7602128 physically the body works differently when upright you can challenge different muscles and allow full expansion of the lungs
7602129 psychologically it lets people live at the upright level and make eye contact
7602130 it may be a burdensome device but it will be very helpful and important for those who choose to use it
7602131 and i was going to stay with her as long as i could and that would be the end and the end came when obama got the votes so i feel very comfortable with that

7602134 would you like me to cut your grass for money
7602135 choosing john mccain in particular would herald the construction of a bridge to the 20th century and not necessarily the last part of it either
7602136 you may or may not agree with obamas policy prescriptions but they are by and large serious attempts to deal with the biggest issues we face a failing health care system oil dependency income stagnation and climate change to the rest of the world a rejection of the promise he represents wouldnt just be an odd choice by the united states it would be taken for what it would be sign and symptom of a nations historical decline
7602137 obama will remain the most unformed candidate in the modern history of presidential politics
7602138 his rhetorical style and his ingrained disposition tend to obscure rather than reveal this is how obama remains enigmatic no matter how much we see of him

7602337 for i was hungry and you gave me something to eat i was thirsty and you gave me something to drink i was a stranger and you invited me in

7602361 wisconsin and four other midwest states have become the epicenter of a spreading arms race between corporate interests trial lawyers ideological groups and political partisans who are committed to bending judges to their will
7602362 business groups have engaged because they finally got tired of being slapped around and seeing hard work in legislatures overturned by activist courts
7602363 thats why you have seen so much attention in the past 10 20 years from both sides on supreme court races
7602364 since the multinational corporations and their front groups like dan peros ajp cant win through public opinion they are spending millions on smear campaigns and attempting to just buy courts that will rubber stamp their antifamily agenda
7602365 the thinking is if you took away the financial incentives for having your judges on the court you would dry up the money
7602366 third party issue groups who dont have to be accountable dont have to follow campaign laws and dont have to disclose their donors siphoned huge amounts of money into this race

7602375 if as the ethics application form states consent was obtained from all subjects how is it that i did not know about my aids status until 1987
7602376 i did not know anything about his studies or research
7602377 i believe nonconsensual research was conducted by doctors of hemophilia in this country
7602378 frustration a sense of being repeatedly betrayed there are lessons to be learned that havent been learned yet
7602379 these people have faced enormous financial and emotional hardships from this catastrophe and they deserve to know what happened and why and to be sure it will never happen again
7602380 obviously this is not the way you want it to happen but its an opportunity for a lot of guys and i am one of the guys who has to step up and take advantage of it
7602381 im more concerned with the team that we have right here in our locker room and that this team mentally prepares itself as best we can
7602382 as always well continue to research all of our options

7602471 he loves basketball you know and plays it still plays it much better than i ever did
7602472 and we talked about the game today and we realized that over the last week or ten days that john mccain has had a 12 and 0 run here in this basketball game
7602473 the end game for the gse situation could be quite a long time in coming
7602474 in our view it is highly unlikely that either fannie mae or freddie macs capital will fall below critical levels by the end of the third quarter so a conservatorship nationalization will likely not occur in the near term
7602475 we believe a capital infusion from the treasury is possible but we view it as also unlikely unless losses in the third quarter go far beyond our worst estimates
7602476 while imminent action is certainly possible it is not clear to us that the treasury is in any rush to act
7602477 ultimately it appears as though treasury action will only be forced if a debt auction freezes up as long as investors keep buying the debt the stock price is irrelevant
7602478 obviously this is not the way you want it to happen but its an opportunity for a lot of guys and i am one of the guys who has to step up and take advantage of it

7602501 the moment i first heard their album rest i was struck by their unique sound inspired musicianship and fresh personality seeing them perform live confirmed for me that they will bring a bold musical style and dynamic personality to dtcs production of tommy which will feature oso closo at the center of the production singing playing and interacting with the actors who will play the characters in the rock opera
7602502 we feel honored and overwhelmed to be a part of a piece of work as legendary as tommy particularly alongside an organization as accomplished as dallas theater center

7602514 we are united and we are together and we are determined
7602515 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7602516 it would have been the same way if i had won and barack was here supporting the unity of the party this was a hard fought campaign and there was a lot of intensity and passion associated with it in part because of the historic nature of our two candidacies
7602517 i dont know im doing everything i can possibly do and i think we have made a strong case
7602518 others feel an obligation to the people who sent them here that they were elected to represent
7602519 that however they decide to vote we will all be united behind senator obama

7602550 its really very interesting that with all these efforts that have gone into building safer highways safer cars better enforcement this really dramatic change were seeing is due to economics to the price of gasoline
7602551 this is really the first time since the 1970s that people are thinking about driving and about what is the cost of an individual trip

7602606 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7602607 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7602608 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7602609 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7602610 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7602611 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7602612 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7602613 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7602614 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7602615 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

7602618 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel

7602635 the government sent a strong military force and attacked the camp with the intention of killing civilians

7602637 obviously this is not the way you want it to happen but its an opportunity for a lot of guys and i am one of the guys who has to step up and take advantage of it
7602638 im more concerned with the team that we have right here in our locker room and that this team mentally prepares itself as best we can

7602645 it has been proven time and time again that he did not locate the h l hunley in fact both the s c hunley commission and the national park service have rejected mr spences claims

7602651 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7602652 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7602653 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7602654 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7602655 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7602656 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7602657 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7602658 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7602659 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7602660 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7602661 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7602662 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7602663 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7602664 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7602665 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7602666 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7602667 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7602668 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7602669 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7602670 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7602671 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7602672 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7602673 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7602674 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7602675 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7602676 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7602677 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7602678 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7602679 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7602680 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7602681 police are investigating the woman most probably was not a nun
7602682 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7602683 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7602684 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7602685 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7602686 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7602687 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7602688 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7602689 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7602690 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7602691 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7602692 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7602693 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7602694 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7602695 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7602696 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7602697 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7602698 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7602699 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7602700 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7602701 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7602702 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7602703 we did a lot better as a defense in this last game obviously which was great for us
7602704 the government of china and its agencies have put to death a large but unknown number of falun gong prisoners of conscience their vital organs including hearts kidneys livers and corneas were virtually simultaneously seized involuntarily for sale at high prices
7602705 that there has been and continues today to be large scale organ seizures from unwilling falun gong practitioners
7602706 the video is being distributed by chinese embassies and consulates its authenticity is therefore endorsed by the chinese government
7602707 an undeniable inculpatory admission of the harvesting of falun gong practitioner prisoners for profit
7602708 i know this song what is it oh man im going to kick myself once someone tells me its name
7602709 i brought a special friend a great american success story
7602710 hes from puerto rico married 15 years and has children ages 14 12 and 10
7602711 a man of few words with a lot of action
7602712 im here to endorse senator mccain because i believe in his ideals and his proposals to help this nation
7602713 hes been a fighter for the hispanic community hes been a fighter for the immigration issue hes the best guy to lead this nation and once again i just want to say thank you to everybody
7602714 from a very poor family lived in part of puerto rico where people make lot of wrong choices
7602715 when he was named the most influential person on earth
7602716 tell us what has independence done for anyone independence is only as good as your income per capita
7602717 while this billboard itself wasnt sexualising children it was placing sex before them
7602718 given what was happening in the community and the senate inquiry into the sexualisation of children in the media we considered that there had been a definite shift in community standards
7602719 there will always be certain hot points within the community that are of concern
7602720 the boards role is to walk the line between advertisers being able to advertise their product and the community not being offended
7602721 now its been brought to a head and we have to find a new message
7602722 the challenge is for us to come up with something clever
7602723 this is about the future of this country about right and wrong and holding accountable the people who who hijacked the department of justice so it was used as political tool to win elections
7602724 if we want to discover the truth and restore justice to this country congress must hold karl rove in contempt
7602725 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7602726 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7602727 what if it all goes right or even better than expected
7602728 we are not convinced that the government needs to take any action over the near term
7602729 we agreed with the australian government with the prime minister that we will discuss how we can participate and how the australian government can give us this opportunity
7602730 its a wonderfully eclectic objet dart speckled with an observable indifference for maureen dowd

7602734 in total there are 10 new layouts for tau crater and since the jetpack is a massive game changing addition to warhawk we included a crap ton of bonus layouts for the original game too there are 30 bonus layouts that add jetpacks into the warhawks original content
7602735 no i just like to have an entire aisle of products in my house in case i ever feel like cleaning
7602736 did you know you have three kinds of bathroom cleanser
7602737 spoiled brat isnt used to cleaning up after herself and it serves her right for bein spoiled so im going to go ahead and ring the hell up her 75 worth of cleaning products and bag them and send her ass on her way because she is stupid and i hope she has fun sticking her hand into a toilet bowl
7602738 helder venter al 5 minuten na de bevalling keek hij om zich heen alsof hij er al maanden was
7602739 obviously this is not the way you want it to happen but its an opportunity for a lot of guys and i am one of the guys who has to step up and take advantage of it
7602740 im more concerned with the team that we have right here in our locker room and that this team mentally prepares itself as best we can
7602741 as always well continue to research all of our options
7602742 i havent heard from anybody else so to say if i would or wouldnt is premature
7602743 as i know it he is probably on a beach somewhere sipping on some pina coladas so i doubt football is the first thing on his mind today
7602744 he has not been bouncing back and forth like brett favre
7602745 kansas fans will wonder where the magic has gone when manginos marvels lose six games this year five more than last year by november order in lawrence will be restored which means ku fans will be looking forward to basketball season
7602746 what were doing i think is going to be viewed as creative but not over the top
7602747 success could make kus mangino more attractive to other programs
7602748 despite the addition of south florida kus mangino still enjoy cupcakes
7602749 how does this process differ from the typical finishing process
7602750 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
7602751 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
7602752 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
7602753 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
7602754 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
7602755 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
7602756 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
7602757 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
7602758 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
7602759 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
7602760 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
7602761 no one works for someone we all just work together
7602762 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
7602763 burger king announced today they would be removing the whopper from their restaurants
7602764 i have a very honorable opponent there are stark differences between us
7602765 i know you have students who come from all over the world i know there are people here who come from countries some from iraq where they have seen the look of war and sacrifice
7602766 hes been a fighter for the hispanic community hes been a fighter for the immigration issue
7602767 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here that they were elected to represent
7602768 that however they decide to vote we will all be united behind senator obama
7602769 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7602770 it would have been the same way if i had won and barack was here supporting the unity of the party
7602771 this was a hard fought campaign and there was a lot of intensity and passion associated with it in part because of the historic nature of our two candidacies
7602772 even before the convention and even before the complete reconciliation that we need
7602773 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
7602774 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7602775 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7602776 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7602777 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7602778 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7602779 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7602780 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7602781 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7602782 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7602783 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7602784 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
7602785 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
7602786 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
7602787 all technicians and artists of tamil industry who are of karnataka origin must also participate in the friday april 4 protest failure of which would lead to non coperation from the industry
7602788 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7602789 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7602790 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7602791 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7602792 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7602793 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7602794 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7602795 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7602796 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7602797 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7602798 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7602799 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7602800 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7602801 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7602802 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7602803 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7602804 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7602805 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7602806 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7602807 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7602808 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7602809 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7602810 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7602811 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7602812 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7602813 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7602814 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7602815 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7602816 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7602817 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7602818 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7602819 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7602820 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7602821 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7602822 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7602823 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7602824 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7602825 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7602826 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7602827 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7602828 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7602829 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7602830 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7602831 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7602832 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7602833 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7602834 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7602835 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7602836 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7602837 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7602838 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7602839 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7602840 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7602841 the faculty who receive the award are master teachers who are using technology in amazing ways to reach students who might not otherwise have access to higher education

7602844 this is a planning took where all things are going
7602845 i have been crucified with christ and i no longer live but christ lives in me
7602846 while there is appeal in referring to the self as a unique entity
7602847 i am fascinated with the strengths of sameness and commonality
7602848 the art of sculpture is endlessly nourished by the desperation and doubt of the artist confronting the task of addressing the treatment of the body as a subject
7602849 that refer to the self and the body in a way that forces one to address his or her own materiality filtered through prevailing cultural influences
7602850 the districts decision to withdraw its mup and other permit applications has dramatically altered the factual picture since the hearing examiner made her decision as the district has gone to great pains to demonstrate the district has not applied for permits it can cut the trees without any city permits or even finalizing construction plans it is not bound to submit the proposal as described to the hearing examiner to the city there is thus no guarantee that any mitigation will actually be constructed once the trees are gone let alone enough to compensate for the massive increase in untreated stormwater to haller lake increase in greenhouse emissions removal of habitat and other impacts that will result from the districts clearcut unlike most land use cases where the court reviews both the permits and the associated sepa review the district in this matter is attempting to manipulate the city of seattles review process by cutting trees before finalizing permit plans the necessary consequence to the district of this course of action is that they cannot rely on hypothetical mitigation measures to justify the determination of non significance unlike the facts presented to the hearing examiner the only action on the table at this time is clear cutting a rare collection of trees and other native species
7602851 if you see something you dont understand you have to ask why
7602852 mr campbell often admonished his students at ridgeview high school
7602853 it wasnt a case of coming out but those that knew him knew that he was gay never liked the whole hing abotu making gay people come out anyways why dont we let people be gay straight who cares i say

7602858 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7602859 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7602860 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7602861 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7602862 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7602863 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7602864 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7602865 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7602866 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best

7602904 la transmisi n de estos juegos ha tenido tambi n una cruz sobre todo en el extra o criterio de las repeticiones algunas competiciones las han repetido hasta cuatro veces y otras ni una y sobre todo cuando la transmisi n era una repetici n por qu no se sobreimpresionaban las im genes con un r tulo

7602912 sanserif looked at in detail is admittedly capable of improvement but there is no doubt that it is the basic form from which the typeface of the future will grow other individual expressive possibilities of type have nothing to do with typography
7602913 the sanserif only seems to be the simpler script it is a form that was violently reduced for little children for adults it is more difficult to read than serifed roman type whose serifs were never meant to be ornamental jan tschichold
7602914 you are living with an 842 year old man who cant even drink a simple glass of iced tea without making a mess

7602929 does the u s air force insist upon a college education before a person can enter our flight training
7602930 i dont know it may be one of those things we assume is necessary but have no proof one way or the other
7602931 trust me you will need algebra to be successful as a scientist engineer or doctor you will need algebra to take college chemistry physics and mathematics algebra is a must
7602932 we are on our way to saint louis we will arrive in five days

7602934 one night when i was in a deep sleep the angel of truth came to me and whispered the secret connection between geometry and algebra
7602935 arkansas needs to affirm the importance of married mothers and fathers
7602936 we need to publicly affirm the gold standard of rearing children whenever we can the state standard should be as close to that gold standard of married mom and dad homes as possible
7602937 i know she and i had a quarrels in the past and some were even shoots but i know how it feels to be in her position and i feel bad for what she is going through
7602938 there is enough land but much of it is in dispute either at the federal level or between indigenous groups
7602939 when a countryman migrates it changes and causes suffering for the community it is like a body without an arm those who do migrate and return come back with other ideas
7602940 zapatas fight was for the poor he started a fight that we are continuing his work lives through the zapatistas
7602941 we have a dream of a land free of borders we fight for the land which is necessary for the growth of the pueblo this is our dream one day we will be free

7602944 the mexican government does not treat women equal to men we have succeeded we have our place here because of womens involvement in the movement more men take responsibility to help care for children and the animals
7602945 it is the only way to understand why the zapatistas came into being
7602946 there is no mass there is no priest although a priest does come and baptize the children on d a de san juan
7602947 because the maya tradition tells the people to be in contact directly with nature
7602948 this is a place created for catholicism and where catholicism still exists but traditional mayan religion is very obviously practiced here
7602949 nafta is one of the main reasons for the huge increase in out migration from mexico
7602950 all sectors have shown increased out migration whether this be the young people women children the elderly everybodys on the move all of those sectors of the population have picked up and moved in increasing numbers
7602951 what this has meant for the indigenous communities is that as the young people leave most of them do not come back
7602952 many times they are now ill at ease speaking their indigenous language participating in the religious rituals etc and what happens is that as the young do not reproduce the indigenous culture that that culture is obviously subjected to the possibility that it may disappear or that it may become part of the mestizo mainstream here in mexico

7602963 the changes will really make for a better more efficient use of the land we have plus it adds another couple of really neat holes into the mix
7602964 it really will be a great finishing hole with some risk reward coming into play

7602968 i was expecting that males would be getting a much higher return for their social networks but the study actually shows quite the opposite
7602969 social networks are very important for female job seekers whereas they are not so important for male job seekers
7602970 they can get information on what the actual salary range might be how desperate the company is to hire someone in to the position how many other good candidates there are in other words how much bargaining power they have
7602971 is it that employers discriminate against females and that they actually need social networks to help them feel better about hiring females because of their stereotypes about female productivity
7602972 i certainly believe that if you know people and somebody is a friend of a friend and theyre hiring you theyre going to be a little more gracious on the scale of what theyre willing to offer because the word might get back to the person they know
7602973 there werent that many cars outside what did they carpool

7603020 if im honest about it it would be very easy to get a big ego
7603021 it would be very easy to puff your chest out a bit and think wow i can go and do anything
7603022 but the reality is it is an amalgamation of different personalities which actually works together
7603023 its like a pop group and if i started getting too big for my boots here and think i can go off and do this that and the other i couldnt without the other people here

7603031 combat troops from iraqi cities by next june and from the rest of the country by the end of 2011
7603032 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7603033 earlier this week i vetoed the bill congress sent me because it set a fixed date to begin to pull out of iraq imposed unworkable conditions on our military commanders and included billions of dollars in spending unrelated to the war
7603034 here is what secretary of defense robert gates recently told congress
7603035 if we were to listen to the democrats in washington d c who say lets have a fixed date of withdrawal by the way thats code word for saying leave before the job is done we would turn over this important country to radicals and extremists who would plot and plan and attack

7603093 reports are that she approached the ips iraqi police saying she had the vest on and didnt want to go through with it
7603094 if she was forced to put on the vest or if she did it voluntarily that is still being reviewed
7603095 the surrender of the suicide bomber indicates that the iraqis are continuing to reject al qaeda and its practices

7603113 i flew in a couple days ago and ive been jousted with and made fun of by mayors all across america who do not respect new jersey so allow me for a moment to talk about our state
7603114 i saw denver mayor john hickenlooper yesterday bragging about beer
7603115 please note not only do i believe that any of our politicians can drink any other states politicians under the table except for cryan he and i are teetotalers but the first brewery where was it in hoboken and the nations first beer city newark new jersey

7603120 this includes the immediate and total withdrawal of russias troops from georgia to positions before the outbreak of the hostilities
7603121 the current occupation by russian troops of strategic positions in georgia is unacceptable and can by no means be considered as additional security measures referred to in the cease fire agreement
7603122 russia as a member state of the council of europe has taken on obligations and commitments to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of its neighbours to settle differences by peaceful means and to uphold human rights and humanitarian law
7603123 what we are witnessing today in georgia with the russian military action is the violation of those commitments
7603124 the constitutions architects never conceived of the president as the man in charge of national destiny
7603125 the cult of the presidency americas dangerous devotion to executive power
7603126 just to hold an office but to gather with you to transform a nation

7603133 i could be president tomorrow and little would really change
7603134 if i tried to govern by the constitution id probably be impeached
7603135 unless there is a change in attitude among the people we wont get back to limited government
7603136 thats what my campaign is about the people who turned out today for pauls speech outside the gop convention hall are the leaders of that change
7603137 true political heroism rarely pounds its chest or pounds the pulpit preaching rainbows and uplift and promising to redeem the world through military force
7603138 a truly heroic president is one who appreciates the virtues of restraint who is bold enough to act when action is necessary yet wise enough humble enough to refuse powers he ought not have that is the sort of presidency we need now more than ever and we wont get that kind of presidency until we demand it

7603144 during the current conflict between russia and georgia a number of statements have been made by several leaders of osce participating states in connection with the rights of states to protect their citizens and in particular national minorities residing abroad
7603145 both the past and the present have shown us that when states take unilateral actions to defend protect or support their citizens or
7603146 one of the bedrocks of international law is that the protection of human rights including minority rights is primarily the responsibility of the states where minorities reside this also holds true in the case of minorities holding dual citizenship
7603147 protecting minority rights is also the responsibility of the international community including the so called
7603148 states should refrain from conferring citizenship en masse to residents of other states which is in violation of the principles of sovereignty and good neighbourly relations
7603149 when human rights including minority rights are violated on a large scale as in cases of ethnic cleansing mass expulsion and acts of terror the international community has a duty to intervene the purpose legitimacy and effectiveness of such intervention are best assured through multilateral operations if unilateral steps are taken particularly by neighbouring states the motives and credibility of their actions may be brought into question

7603163 my job as president would be to try to make sure that we are tightening the screws diplomatically on iran that weve mobilized the world community to go after irans program in a serious way to get sanctions in place so that iran starts making a difficult calculation

7603169 we lose about 35 000 a year in materials that are checked out and not returned
7603170 those overdue fees and fines they do add up so at our library with the size of our community in fort smith we take in about 100 000 every year
7603171 if people dont bring their books back the library may start charging more in late fees for other people to make up for what people dont pay

7603177 i may be opposite to abortions for religious reasons to take one example but if i seek to pass a law banning the practice i cant simply point to the teachings of my church or invoke gods will i have to explain why abortion violates some principal that is accessible to all faiths including those with no faith at all

7603185 these rules were never going to stop all the parties at the conventions everyone and their brother holds receptions at the conventions
7603186 this is a chance for the chamber to meet with a lot of people who dont work in washington and hear their voices
7603187 to showcase the elective process in the best light possible
7603188 to present and display the many leading edge technologies and innovations that we offer
7603189 is proud to support the democratic and republican national conventions
7603190 we make every effort to comply with all state and federal regulations that govern events such as receptions entertainment etc for candidates and elected officials
7603191 largely have failed to make the nominating conventions more respectable political events
7603192 the conventions have become mostly privately financed soirees funded by corporations and lobbying firms that seek favours from the federal government
7603193 unlimited soft money donations from special interests to pay for the conventions and the lavish parties and wining and dining at the conventions run counter to the federal election law and congressional ethics rules
7603194 i think there is a new kind of satire thats coming out it isnt necessarily targeted at individuals but rather at the system which people seem rather tired of
7603195 its almost like the politicians are second guessing the jokes that the comedians are going to do

7603229 what use is trending if a vivah makes 30 crores in 25 weeks when something like sik makes it over
7603230 a silver lining in these scandals is that infidelity is still scandalous this shows that all the efforts to discount bill clintons cheating as just sex didnt change the national perception or even democrats that fidelity matters
7603231 infidelity sexual or financial carries national security risks making a politician vulnerable to blackmail or criminal behavior to cover up his actions but it also betrays a lack of character and good judgment that he is willing to sacrifice everything that matters even people who depend on him for something not nearly as important
7603232 there are two trend lines that would indicate these concerns will not be a factor one the anxiety level in the public is so deep and serious right now that some of the trivial sensational issues are not going to have the impact they had in the past
7603233 the second thing is that its a mistake to think the public only sees imperfection and failings of just the other side both parties have their share of peccadilloes for every eliott spitzer and john edwards theres a larry craig or a mark foley
7603234 we didnt need to bring faith to the party faith was already here
7603235 democrats have been and will continue to be people of faith and millions of people of faith have been and will continue to be democrats
7603236 senator obama is a committed christian and he believes that people of all faiths have an important place in american life
7603237 it saddens me deeply that much evil is being done in the name of my religion
7603238 yet when we confront evil we must make sure we do not ruin lives of innocent people in the process
7603239 moral and spiritual pain at the lives of the unborn
7603240 loudly proclaim their advocacy for the unborn but refuse to acknowledge their responsibility and the responsibility of our nation to those who have been born
7603241 it wouldn t be wise for me to be seen as picking a political side when i ve consistently said both sides are right in some areas and wrong in some areas
7603242 well welcome to the party youve earned a place with many entrepreneurs before you weve all been where youve been
7603243 even before the convention and even before the complete reconciliation that we need
7603244 the nomination is decided we have a vice president were going to work together and go forward
7603245 but to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive

7603304 your full name the full name of your parent s date and place of birth sex date the birth record was filed and the seal or other certification of the official custodian of such records
7603305 we couldnt get someone on the phone in hawaii to tell us whether the number represented some secret information and we erred on the side of blacking it out
7603306 since then weve found out its pretty irrelevant for the outside world
7603307 it is possible that obama conspired his way to the precipice of the worlds biggest job involving a vast network of people and government agencies over decades of lies anythings possible but step back and look at the overwhelming evidence to the contrary and your sense of whats reasonable has to take over
7603308 you have such beautiful heart breaking sad songs but you gotta have some fun too
7603309 the tracy reese spring 2009 collection is an ethereal progression of nature through the seasons with delicate yet sophisticated pieces that emanate modern romance
7603310 we didnt know about your fathers passing so we assumed you quit
7603311 the pernicious impact of the end of session fundraising is the appearance that contributions are purchasing influence
7603312 and the perception that campaign contributions are buying influence is multiplied when a vote comes within days of a lawmaker cashing a check
7603313 its misleading the public as to when the money was really given
7603314 theyre deferring the disclosure they dont want to list people who were at their fundraiser theyre trying to give the appearance the money was not given at the time legislation was being considered
7603315 so its not right in the middle of all this i agree with the governor that there should be a ban at this time of year when youve got a lot of bills going through here
7603316 but the truth is you get used to it because its come to be a pervasive culture the need to raise money
7603317 there is no time when its less compromising than the other
7603318 even if you were to prohibit fundraising in the final weeks of session what does that do it changes the date of fundraisers whatever influence there is it is a constant
7603319 we want to wait just in case somebody gets nicked
7603320 well need a guy to work with the defense and hes a pretty good quarterback
7603321 ive always felt a good game plan is when you have to eliminate things throughout the week i dont like to add things i like to eliminate
7603322 we want to start the season as high as we can and then with reps just get better
7603323 the main thing is we have to play at the highest level that we can play and give it our best effort i believe in these guys i know they will play to the best of their ability
7603324 when i first came here i was able to read coverages pretty quick because we ran an offense in high school pretty similar to this one similar to saint louis offense my understanding of what the quarterback goes through in the offense adapts to me as a receiver
7603325 i liked what he did last wednesday when we went live caught the ball in a crowd found the open areas he knows the system
7603326 kealoha and jon are coming theyre right there i wouldnt be afraid to have them play were going to have to use them so theyre coming along nicely
7603327 like coach greg mcmackin says it takes a lot of reps in order to get this stuff down on offense as far as receivers and qbs
7603328 its more getting a feel for knowing where people are on the field before the snap of the ball confidence is a big thing too the more reps you get the more confident you get catching the ball running your route
7603329 he was so versatile he was able to fill both roles for us
7603330 he just lives and breathes football hes the kind of kid you love to coach so im not surprised hes finding his niche at uh as a receiver hes not the biggest or the fastest guy around hes all guts and heart and guile and finds a way to make it happen
7603331 its kind of a trip to know the same person who was playing quarterback with me is doing it big in college beating notre dame last year i was real happy for him
7603332 the kids from hawaii are really really good and they got a great start from the get go
7603333 they are very solid they did a great job my hats off to them my congratulations
7603334 these guys have been mentally tough on this ordeal weve been on since july once we left honolulu and i didnt think one more day would affect them much
7603335 we have been really working hard and just knowing that we are the wac champs we have to work 10 times harder to defend our title
7603336 we know everyone is going to be gunning for us so that motivates us to work even harder so we can keep our title
7603337 we want to continue doing what we did the last three years
7603338 namely playing possession ball and always looking to improve the quality of passing we want to try emphasize more and more about keeping the ball on the ground because its so much easier to play the game that way unless youre dealing with the last pass
7603339 i need to hurry them up into the process of owning the middle of the field
7603340 if we make it to the ncaas we can actually win a game we are returning nine starters and hopefully we can jell better i think we can do really good
7603341 everyone has higher expectations for this year because we won the wac last year and we made it to the ncaas and we didnt get killed we competed so i think everyone knows we can compete at a higher level now and they dont just settle for winning the wac
7603342 we were picked to be first i would rather be picked fifth and not have all this pressure on you
7603343 last season we were picked fifth and we had nothing to lose because everyone thought we sucked and now its like were the ones to beat so we have to prove that to everyone so its a lot of pressure
7603344 its just good for the team where they are triggering this very fast paced group defense

7603356 alcuni dicono che la pioggia brutta ma non sanno che permette di girare a testa alta con il viso coperto dalle lacrime
7603357 e credere in te soltanto giurare in te soltanto riporre in te soltanto la mia fede la mia forza il mio orgoglio tutto il mio mondo tutto quel che sogno e tutto quel che spero

7603448 a philosophy and practice emphasizes socially culturally and environmentally responsible building this is typically realized in the use of basic elemental materials e g earth wood stone and straw that require little or no processing and are found on site or locally sourced the methods of natural building are often labor intensive but not capital intensive because natural building espouses an approach that preferentially uses materials that are processed less and travel fewer miles they tend to contribute less greenhouse gases than their conventionally built counterparts in addition naturally built structures tend to be smaller better sited to take advantage of the interplay between solar radiation and thermal mass and occupied by folks who have the inclination to examine and minimize their carbon footprints

7603602 yo soy muy nacionalista siento mucho la camiseta cuando represento a mi pa s
7603603 yo vine aqu con un sue o ganar una medalla para mi pa s y para m
7603604 lo conversaba con rafa nadal despu s del partido esto es cada cuatro a os y hay que disfrutarlo qui n sabe si vamos a poder hacerlo para la pr xima

7603606 esto es muy grande un gran objetivo cumplido lo hice en atenas y ahora lo hice aqu los juegos ol mpicos realmente significan mucho para m me siento un poquito triste por c mo se dio el partido pero estoy feliz
7603607 chis esto se acab hace diez minutos y ya quieren me ponga a hablar del 2012 pero bueno la verdad es que me encantar a la gente vibra mucho con los juegos y eso se nota cuando uno vuelve a casa
7603608 rafa me sorprendi mucho con su servicio puso muchos primeros servicios y jug realmente c modo domin el juego con la primera pelota y me hizo correr mucho
7603609 no sent bien la pelota con mi drive err diez o doce tiros que normalmente no fallo y adem s al frente estaba l
7603610 parece f cil parece f cil pero cuando est s corriendo tanto te sientes un poco cansado te sientes un poco mareado estaba esperando que me tirara un passing y me encontr con la bola m s f ciles eran los dos puntos siguientes que desperdici pero bueno es parte del juego
7603611 ahora se est n dando cuenta de lo importante que son los juegos ol mpicos para un pa s quiz s hace algunos a os no les preocupaba mucho pero para m siempre fueron especiales
7603612 la verdad es que me encantar a poder defender esta medalla en londres 2012
7603613 me voy feliz con mi medalla de oro pero si hubiera sido de plata tambi n habr a estado feliz se lo dije a fernando esto es s lo cada cuatro a os y hay que disfrutarlo a tope
7603614 oportunidades como sta tienes pocas en la vida y haber conseguido esta medalla es un enorme placer
7603615 pues claro que me queda por mejorar si roger federer que es el mejor jugador del mundo puede mejorar por qu yo no
7603616 vivir en la villa no estar en un hotel compartir con los otros atletas es algo que realmente se agradece creo que todo eso me ayud a estar en mi ciento por ciento y si no hubiera estado en mi ciento por ciento quiz s no habr a ganado el oro
7603617 hace muchos a os que no ve a a un jugador que se mueva en la cancha como nadal hoy d a fernando le jugaba paralelo sobre su rev s y llegaba con su derecha adem s fue muy inteligente en los puntos importantes siempre le sac al cuerpo a fernando no no hab a nada que hacer
7603618 estos jugadores te dan s lo una o dos posibilidades por partido y fernando la tuvo nota se refiere al 6 5 y 15 40 del segundo set pero dud en la volea pero incluso si hubiera ganado ese set probablemente s lo se habr a alargado el partido y nada m s
7603619 sin duda va a ser una inyecci n an mica para el us open para la copa davis y para lo que resta del a o y ojal que se note especialmente en la copa davis chile merece volver a estar en el grupo mundial
7603620 harper performs such a comprehensive service to the overall community

7603624 theres nothing that would please my soul more than to see obama lose
7603625 if that enthusiasm continues then its done and she gets credit for moving her supporters into the victory column
7603626 make sure the significance of her historic primary is not lost
7603627 it was a platonic type of endorsement shes just doing what shes supposed to be doing
7603628 we are not convinced that the government needs to take any action over the near term
7603629 football is only a game spiritual things are eternal nevertheless beat texas
7603630 after you retire theres only one big event left and i aint ready for that
7603631 the man who complains about the way the ball bounces is likely to be the one who dropped it
7603632 motivation is simple you eliminate those who are not motivated

7603637 in alabama an atheist is someone who doesnt believe in bear bryant
7603638 you can learn more character on the two yard line than anywhere else in life
7603639 its kind of hard to rally around a math class
7603640 i make my practices real hard because if a player is a quitter i want him to quit in practice not in a game
7603641 theres one sure way to stop us from scoring give us the ball near the goal line
7603642 lads youre not to miss practice unless your parents died or you died
7603643 i never graduated from iowa but i was only there for two terms trumans and eisenhowers
7603644 my advice to defensive players take the shortest route to the ball and arrive in a bad humor
7603645 i could have been a rhodes scholar except for my grades
7603646 they cut us up like boarding house pie and thats real small pieces
7603647 show me a good and gracious loser and ill show you a failure
7603648 i asked darrell royal the coach of the texas longhorns why he didnt recruit me and he said
7603649 son youve got a good engine but your hands arent on the steering wheel
7603650 football is not a contact sport it is a collision sport dancing is a contact sport
7603651 if lessons are learned in defeat our team is getting a great education
7603652 the only qualifications for a lineman are to be big and dumb to be a back you only have to be dumb
7603653 oh we played about like three tons of buzzard puke this afternoon
7603654 it isnt necessary to see a good tackle you can hear it
7603655 we live one day at a time and scratch where it itches
7603656 we didnt tackle well today but we made up for it by not blocking
7603657 three things can happen when you throw the ball and two of them are bad
7603658 ive found that prayers work best when you have big players
7603659 if you want to participate you will have to reinvent yourself
7603660 big corporations today want to present themselves as benefactors of the human race
7603661 exxonmobil runs ads about the ecology now and architecture is part of this its a business
7603662 with the triumph of liberal democracy and laissez faire capitalism the conversation came to an end everyone wanted to build which left less room for certain kinds of architecture
7603663 the idea is that its not nature that creates catastrophes

7603668 hes partly obsessed by the newspapers because of the start of the world war
7603669 the diary is written against this almost traumatized understanding that there is going to have to be a second world war
7603670 i thought if you publish what he wrote as he wrote it in real time people would find that rather engaging
7603671 no one knows the outcome whether he lives or dies from letter to letter
7603672 the pr department continues to grow and look for young professionals with energy enthusiasm and drive
7603673 ebony fits that profile perfectly she is a great addition to the team
7603674 so are the opportunities for electronics makers content providers and consumers to get connected
7603675 consumers really arent driving the trend toward networked devices the device makers are
7603676 the companies are pushing this to try to build a new business to offer new services it is really a matter of getting the infrastructure in place
7603677 what this means for consumers is that some people may bring products home and discover that they cant communicate with others on their networks
7603678 we are just starting to see the first networked products roll out and a shakeout in standards is inevitable

7603699 if im honest about it it would be very easy to get a big ego
7603700 it would be very easy to puff your chest out a bit and think wow i can go and do anything
7603701 but the reality is it is an amalgamation of different personalities which actually works together
7603702 its like a pop group and if i started getting too big for my boots here and think i can go off and do this that and the other i couldnt without the other people here
7603703 you really have to know your sport ive been involved with cycling most of my life
7603704 the challenge from here is to take this on another stage towards the next olympics which just happen to be in london
7603705 the new olympiad started about five minutes ago we are already into it and we are aspiring
7603706 whether the next olympics were in london rio or sydney i would still be thinking the same thing our job is to step on and we have to be about improving

7603714 coming from california ive never been anywhere like this before
7603715 i was trying my best but i dont think they believed me when i told them i was taking a trip to the woods
7603716 its really nice up here and its something that i know none of them have ever seen before but after growing up in the city i dont think they can believe that im out here
7603717 this is my second year but i dont think you ever really know what youre getting into
7603718 you have an idea but once you get up here and actually get involved with the communities you get a better perspective on the lifestyle the needs and the difference you can make
7603719 it took me awhile to realize where i was its like something i would see on tv when im sitting at home on my couch so it was a real culture shock to me absolutely shocking with a capital a but the kids are real energetic and they like to run around like me so im having a great time they have a lot out here and theyre giving a lot so there are plenty of positives for them to take away from this week
7603720 i was actually really sore when i woke up in the morning because i had been lifting kids all day long
7603721 it was one after another and there were like 300 kids out there so it turned into quite the workout
7603722 i had a couple favourites that were hanging around me throughout the week
7603723 its nice to be able to have that kind of effect on little guys and it worked well because since i had their attention i could get them to focus on the drills we were running its really nice to see how they pick up on that kind of stuff
7603724 ive never been fishing off a boat before especially not in an area like this so i was really thankful to be able to do that and reel in my first pike
7603725 it may have taken us a little while to get here and im still not even sure where to point myself out on a map but its great being up here the kids are amazing and the hospitality of the whole village has been phenomenal

7603728 were making cuts now its a one year fix to get us through the next year were focused on the long term and its my hope that we can restore publication as soon as possible he said this morning in a phone interview
7603729 were doing this basically to ensure we dont get into deep financial problems he said were not an organization with deep
7603730 we get advertising from several agencies and theres been a big drop
7603731 scotland should always be a stand alone nation at whatever i believe
7603732 i have been very proud to represent scotland at the commonwealth games and thats something i will always cherish and i will hopefully compete again in future years
7603733 but today we are here to celebrate being a british team
7603734 scotland is part of britain they are not mutually exclusive im a proud scot and im a very proud brit as well
7603735 in terms of scotland becoming an olympic nation by itself i think there needs to be a lot more investment in sport up there in terms of facilities again
7603736 but today is about the british team really and we are here to celebrate that
7603737 for him scottish sports minister stewart maxwell to call for a scottish olympic team at this stage is ridiculous
7603738 i wouldnt have three gold medals hanging round my neck if i wasnt part of the british team
7603739 im a scottish athlete in a british team and im proud to be a british athlete
7603740 as we invest in world class sports infrastructure to host glasgow 2014 including a new national velodrome and a lasting sporting legacy for the whole nation we can also build up the level of scotlands sporting ambitions for the future
7603741 we look forward to discussing all of these issues with chris hoy and scotlands entire sporting community so that we can build on the fantastic success that our athletes achieved in beijing and melbourne in 2006
7603742 we hear chriss remarks about the sports facilities we have in scotland at this stage but as we prepare for glasgow 2014 we are moving towards significantly better infrastructure which can form the basis of even higher scottish ambitions for the future in relation to the olympics and a scottish team
7603743 the important thing here is that we do give people the opportunity to participate in the olympics
7603744 but at the same time i dont think the majority of scots would want to see the scotland international team then be unable to compete anywhere else
7603745 that would be scotland england northern ireland or wales it would not be a gb team
7603746 so fundamentally it does not work and that is why it was dismissed at a very early stage some years ago
7603747 last night i was called an uncle tom by emil jones in the lobby of the hotel right in front of ald freddrenna lyle and ald leslie hairston and ald latasha thomas
7603748 i walked over to him and asked him what did you just call me
7603749 were being treated by the city of denver and the secret service like political prisoners like pariahs
7603750 were going to stay here for just a couple of minutes to state our disgust with this abomination the way the city and secret service are tearing the constitution of the united states to shreds and then we will leave

7603762 among the 38 comments posted to that item and sent via e mail was the suggestion that we make it easier to find romenesko from elsewhere on the site
7603763 we paid attention we made jim part of the main navigation of the site since then about 1 100 people have joined our alpha group many of them chiming in with suggestions
7603764 we were overdue weve added a lot of content to the site since we last did a significant redesign nearly six years ago weve been hearing from people for a long time that theres a lot of valuable stuff on the site but they have a lot of trouble actually finding it weve tried to address that with a cleaner clearer design and navigation weve also introduced advertising both help wanted ads for journalists and display ads and needed to do a better job incorporating those ads in our pages
7603765 this is the third major redesign of my page and its safe to say that all of them were heavily criticized when launched many readers loved this version of my site and screamed when it was updated which is hard to believe now
7603766 we hope readers users will appreciate the improvements and feedback so far indicates that a lot of them do
7603767 we know we cant please everybody though and will do our best to listen to critics especially critics with specific issues or suggestions
7603768 were very pleased that backdrop by widen can extend the adobe photoshop lightroom workflow

7603772 we are turning the heat up on idol this year and are thrilled to welcome kara to the judges table
7603773 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7603774 a lot of our performance directors have really delivered so its not going to be surprising for their phones to be ringing
7603775 we have some of the best in the world there will be many other countries who will want to poach them from us
7603776 we need four years of funding in place for the national governing bodies so they can negotiate contracts to sign them up now for 2012 it cannot be done on a year by year basis
7603777 the political nature of the decisions the electoral commission is called upon to exercise are factors that in this case should make courts reluctant to intervene in the commissions discretion
7603778 the epmu will be able to run a campaign similar to the campaign that they ran at the 2005 election which will attack the national party and will be doing so despite not lawfully being allowed to do so
7603779 in 10 years hes taken no holiday no vacation just practice practice practice
7603780 hes got the mental strength the way he executes the shot hes virtually got the nickname danny the machine because he just hits the ball so straight
7603781 ive never seen someone execute a golf ball so consistently once he gets on to a birdie trail shooting under par you cant stop him
7603782 dannys got the attitude of im going to beat him hes got that self belief hell be chasing tiger hell have him in his sights
7603783 one should differentiate between an isomer program and what might be called the hafnium program
7603784 the former has added significantly to the body of science as documented by many peer reviewed and published results that have achieved acceptance in the nuclear physics community the hafnium program was focused to my knowledge on proving a specific claimed effect that has even now not been successfully observed by any independent and skeptical group it would be a shame to throw the baby out with the bath water by equating these two overlapping yet distinct programs with quite different aims and outcomes
7603785 this would then be the first time human control would be exerted over nuclear levels
7603786 arkansas needs to affirm the importance of married mothers and fathers

7603791 i cannot recommend a site any more than this one
7603792 he is absolute in his justice seeking beautifully informational staunchly analytical and a joy to behold i consider it both a duty and a delight to keep coming back here

7603835 didnt talk about god or the importance of religious devotion
7603836 he does not describe himself as one denomination or another but he felt like the baptist church in north phoenix had a good message a message that resonated with him and so that is where he goes to church
7603837 i believe his faith is deep but he will not use it to try to get somebody to vote for him
7603838 i just think that thats his style that he just does not wear his religion on his sleeve
7603839 i pray to a loving god that he bless and protect them
7603840 he believes that politicians or leaders shouldnt be judged on their religious beliefs but rather they should be judged on their preparedness to do the job

7603848 for years she composed the most beautiful christmas letters in poetry form i keep finding little bits of poems that shed started just tucked away here and there
7603849 she loved to read that was the one thing from her childhood that she talked about how she was always trying to hide away with a book and someone was always finding her and putting her to work
7603850 she wanted to come home to montana it was too painful to stay and even harder to leave
7603851 she was absolutely the most loving person i ever knew
7603852 she was a hopeless romantic and she loved life no matter what it brought if she saw a person walking in a snowstorm shed stop and pick him up thats who she was

7603866 important the ansi c libraries are not part of the palm development platform in many cases you can perform the same function using a palm os api call as you can with a call to a ansi c function for example the palm os provides a string manager that performs many of the string functions youd expect to be able to perform in an ansi c program if you do use a standard c function the code for the function is linked into your application and results in a bigger executable

7603869 thus the court recognized the important issue that will need to be resolved in a case interpreting the gpl whether a program linked to gpld software can be considered a derivative work of that software the court also raised the question of whether subsequent shipping of source code can cure a breach of the gpl without permission to continue shipment from either the author or subsequent distributor of the software

7603878 i told you guys i told you guys that this thing is bullshit that obama wasnt that great
7603879 i hate biden but lets face it obama could have picked charles manson as veep and he would still be preferable to mccain
7603880 obama is pro net neutrality you mean obama is pro government regulation of the internet which is quite consistent with bidens position
7603881 he sponsored a bill in 2002 that would have make it a federal felony to trick certain types of devices into playing unauthorized music or executing unapproved computer programs
7603882 i think we need to quickly take the issue of brazilian sport more seriously
7603883 winning olympic medals is always positive but it doesnt have to be a priority for a country like brazil
7603884 so that we have more competitive teams more competitive athletes which will improve brazils chances of better performance
7603885 so we can compete in the olympics in equivalent conditions
7603886 if we start doing that now we have a chance to improve a lot in 2012
7603887 south america has never had the olympics and i think that the olympic games should come to south america its an important issue for us brazilians and we are going to fight

7603897 prior to 9 11 and hurricanes katrina and rita few business in the us outside of power companies telco and financial services providers bothered to prepare for disasters
7603898 the stakes are higher because businesses are expected to remain operational around the clock and globalisation requires that they do so in multiple locations
7603899 these vendors will increasingly be considered for strategic service deals and will augment or in some cases replace todays acknowledged megavendors in this space
7603900 such a shift in the it service landscape is a key trend that application development and sourcing managers need to understand and prepare for
7603901 our analysis indicates that the top five india based it companies have raised combined market share from 33 per cent in the 2004 financial year to 40 per cent in the 2008 financial year
7603902 these companies took a 51 per cent share of incremental revenue in 2008
7603903 we believe this trend will continue in 2009 as vendor consolidation gathers momentum we expect the indian it industry to grow at 20 per cent in us terms in 2009 despite the us slowdown
7603904 our product needs to have quality of design quality of concepts architecture of the system but it also must have quality of execution in the code we write and how well it performs compared with what is required
7603905 we needed to be able to test such a complex environment and not spend a massive amount of time managing the testing process tracking requirements and issues and referring them back to the developer
7603906 we used to do all of those things on spreadsheets and kind of manually and it was very laborious
7603907 we can now execute a test process in a week rather than a month so if we allow two weeks for testing we will be doing it in half the time and will do twice as much
7603908 it allows the team to share resources because there is a single spot where we have all of the requirements recorded
7603909 we can register the test results and know what issues occurred by function in which particular release of the product and who were the developers so there is complete traceability which is very important
7603910 we can also pinpoint areas where the number of errors is greater and it gives an idea as to which team member has a higher than average number of incidents
7603911 the moment we start capturing the process data in the database it is there to crunch the numbers and analyse it
7603912 if i sent software to thousands of sites and it had a problem that would be intolerable we just cannot do that
7603913 for a company that strives to produce impeccable product it is difficult to live without such a tool
7603914 we already have certain components of process management in our own application so we need to do a bit of integration
7603915 we have a help desk system that tracks all the calls and ultimately we would like to get that integrated with what we do there because some of those calls would translate into software defects
7603916 having printer dots secretly scattered on everything you print which indelibly connect your print out to the printer it came from and even the time and date it was printed is a major privacy violation wherever you are
7603917 its even worse when those printers are being used by dissidents living under authoritarian regimes wasnt the printing press supposed to spread freedom not automatically finger enemies of the state
7603918 for as long as there has been currency there have been counterfeiters
7603919 many customers seek the protection of counterfeit detection particularly banking and financial institutions
7603920 weve reached a point where so much customer information is sold to third parties that most people have resigned themselves to this fact of life personally and professionally
7603921 i do wonder if the dots can be removed when hard drive erase on an imaging printing device is invoked
7603922 sorry but for security reasons i cannot discuss the details of the technology
7603923 such processing may give rise to the violation of fundamental human rights namely the right to privacy and private life
7603924 it also might violate the right to protection of personal data
7603925 printer manufacturers have voluntarily complied and voluntarily withheld information from their own customers
7603926 the merger helps us better serve our agents as well as our clients
7603927 we view the colorado springs market as a market with a tremendous amount of growth potential the union of these two companies is a step in the right direction

7603933 a nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master and deserves one
7603934 even in events where gold wasnt won weve raised our level enormously
7603935 state and popular support economic development and social stability have all been huge factors
7603936 its all cumulative the result of a lot of hard work and competition
7603937 its hard to name a single reason for the improvement there are a lot of factors involved
7603938 these olympic games its so nice but not for european people
7603939 chinas breakthrough in rowing wouldnt have been possible without foreign coaching
7603940 the methodology is different but the substance is the same

7603952 esta clase de partido pasa muy pocas veces no he vivido esto ni como jugador ni como entrenador

7603955 que no jugara fue una decisi n m a s lo quise convocar para tenerlo y que est cerca del equipo porque vamos a ver qu pasa al final lo mejor es que siga
7603956 meaning that customers were voting that they would rather go some place and have their photos printed rather than trying to print them at home
7603957 you dont have to have absolutely perfect quality on the first version of the technology if you are aiming at the home and office
7603958 many times documents are printed when they could really be dealt with in digital form
7603959 we can work with customers to show them how to build systems that actually reduce the volume of paper in their organisation
7603960 the savings that can be made in organisations is significant
7603961 youll never get rid of paper totally but through efficient planning you can reduce the volume
7603962 the same approach can work for things like letterhead documents and forms
7603963 printing these things as needed means that lots of pre printed sheets wont go out of date and have to be thrown away
7603964 it might sound counter intuitive coming from a printing company but the more you reduce physical output the more benefits you get in cost and reducing the environmental impact
7603965 its true that you can always refill or recycle cartridges but not having anything to recycle is even better
7603966 there is little doubt that placing the responsibility on manufacturers for the collection and cost of recycling e waste will give them a strong incentive to design products that are easier to de manufacture consume fewer materials and reduce harmful content
7603967 bush son had dinner plans with hinckley brother before shooting
7603968 it is illegal amp against its charter for the nsa to spy domestically unless it receives permission from the fisa court to do so and then only if it can prove that the american citizen to be placed under surveillance is in contact with an international terrorist so exactly what is the nsa doing illegally spying on myself and millions of other unwitting americans
7603969 nsa personnel can dial up any individual in the country on the signals lntelligence emf scanning network and the nsas computers will then pinpoint and track that person 24 hours a day the nsa can pick out and track anyone in the u s
7603970 the followings a diagram of the type of mind control software that agencies like the nsa utilize on targets of illegal mind control research any american citizen can be targeted for this satellite based weaponry at any time without their knowledge or consent
7603971 the dia research dates from 1976 and shows the dangers were known about over twenty years ago the soviets used the frequencies and intensities used by mobile phones 1800 mhz and 900 mhz as weapons it is a rule of the intelligence community that you hide things in plain view getting the public to accept microwave mind control weapons which affect their behavior under the guise of mobile phones was a stroke of genius getting the public to pay for these microwave mind control devices so their brains and behavior can be damaged to make them more docile and easy to control was pure diabolical genius
7603972 what happens when the fbi spends millions of dollars targeting an american citizen for an illegal cointelpro operation while perpetrating precedent setting violations of that citizens constitutional rights yet fails to arrest that person the fbi then uses the media to slander the targeted person and coercion to blackmail those around the target including the targets family into keeping silent in regard to the torture they are being subjected to in efforts to drive them to suicide such precedent setting crimes are now being perpetrated against my person by the fbi nsa amp dhs you could be their next victim
7603973 the indigo blue ribbon campaign to promote the awareness of people targeted for mind control amp organized stalking crimes
7603974 what is the us federal government doing using satellites to spy on americans within the privacy of their own homes this has been occurring since long before the 9 11 attacks black operations which were an inside job perpetrated to keep the war on terror open ended so that the illuminati run us federal government can continue to erode our freedoms under the pretext of protecting us from an invisible enemy
7603975 we need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society the purpose is physical control of the mind everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated the individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence but this is only his personal point of view this lacks historical perspective man does not have the right to develop his own mind this kind of liberal orientation has great appeal we must electrically control the brain some day armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain
7603976 consider the damage done to us as a people by the us congress cia fbi dod nsa and dhs alone the biological chemical and electronic warfare that they have subjected so many of us to the illegal and humiliating nsa satellite spying of us within the privacy of our own domiciles the inhumanity of their mind control torture the complete manipulation of the us economy through the illuminati controlled federal reserve bank and irs and the treasonous crimes committed by them through the improperly ratified and unconstitutional federal reserve act the us federal governments usurpation and manipulation of the us media through the cias operation mockingbird the abject treason of the attacks on 9 11 and one can only arrive at the following conclusion only a population that is either extremely ignorant of the facts or masochistic would ever allow for a government which is such anathema to exist within their country
7603977 so to begin i want to state the most basic of all facts about brainwashing in the entire history of man no one has ever been brainwashed and realized or believed that he had been brainwashed
7603978 nothing would warrant the monitoring of individuals every minute habit 24 7 unless theyre us intelligence doing illegal inhumane testing
7603979 the most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed
7603980 the extensive crimes against humanity which the us federal government controlled by the privately held federal reserve bank has perpetrated against the american people which includes the crime of menticide are so far reaching that in most instances its beyond their comprehension the people of this planet must stop thinking in groups amp starting thinking for themselves the illuminati has us convinced that we should be fighting eachother as in making war on other countries when it is the illuminati which operates through our banking systems amp governments whom we should be working to destroy
7603981 these guys are professional liars who have raised selected memory loss to an art form
7603982 with the creation of this website ive done the best i can to document the nsas illegal spying and mind control operations which adversely affect myself and myriad other americans in the present day there are also citizens from many other countries reporting this same phenomenon
7603983 as for the 9 11 attacks with the satellite spy technology that the nsa has incorporated into its echelon spy system there is absolutely no way that this agency would not have known about the attacks on 9 11 before hand if osama bin ladin was really behind these attacks as we have been told the nsa could have immediately disabled him through the use of directed energy weapons technology bin laden like lee harvey oswald was nothing more than a lightening rod used to cover up yet another major us intelligence black operation perpetrated against the american people

7603987 no invention in history has been more successful in the collection and display of stupidity than the internet
7603988 this psychiatry s t apparently what youre feeling is not what youre feeling and what youre not feeling is your real agenda
7603989 silas start talking business what are the plans for today
7603990 first on the list for today is to finish tracking down that tanker that managed to get away from us and blow it up then we were going to make some supply runs between the ied crossing stations on the phalanx line
7603991 frack the freighter set course for the crossing stations and handle it im going to take a shower
7603992 well be at sun tzu station in about ten minutes youre expected to at least mingle with the buyers and have a drink at the stations bar
7603993 youll need to wear your uniform so you might as well
7603994 silas you remember the last time i went onto an imperial station i would rather not be running from the fleet for another month
7603995 crap looks like a royal navy frigate is also parked at this particular base
7603996 isnt that good news check its registry and make sure its not an old friend
7603997 seventy three citations for bravery forty three citations for defense of the empire and sixteen merits of honor from the emperor himself
7603998 if they even thought you had almost the same number of crf awards theyd shoot you on sight youre lucky the emperor keeps your little secret from the navies
7603999 i guess it also helps that i hold the rank of flag captain of the third imperial armada and lord admiral of the sirius star
7604000 the emperor always did like having a high ranking noble in the imperial navy on his side
7604001 especially since the imperial navy is prone to picking new emperors when the old one ticks it off
7604002 looks like a new friend nothing we need to worry about i dont think batistas even come with the type of equipment to identify us
7604003 two and a half hours were in a holding pattern believe it or not
7604004 why the frak is this place so busy did someone important die
7604005 like i care to know just get aboard and make some credits
7604006 yes i think i shall android 21a has just finished a neural refitting it should be able to take my program
7604007 silas ive said it once and ill say it again this look is really slimming for you
7604008 arent you glad the empire stopped experimenting with sentient ai after my creation
7604009 otherwise they might have a cybernetic rebellion as well as a division in the human race to deal with
7604010 silas im going to take a nap wake me when were docked
7604011 perhaps his breeding isnt pure enough his mother was a worthless whore from a border colony
7604012 no it was his genetic abnormalities that allowed him to survive the first batch of testing your son is the perfect specimen for our tests
7604013 doctors admiral i think the boy needs rest he is exhausted and in pain
7604014 yes throw him in a cell if he shows no changed by the next test have him put down he obviously wasnt worth the frack that made him
7604015 admiral your son could unlock the key to creating the perfect super solders i would say he is more valuable then even you
7604016 no spawn of mine would be this much of a coward
7604017 but only the sentient interactive linguistically advanced system program used my voice
7604018 he needs to integrate to merge who the serum made him into with the person he was before the serum changed him he needs to learn to accept who he was and what he is
7604019 i know about as much as you he was the admirals son
7604020 doctor jefferson was a blasphemer of the worst kind he tried to become god by creating sentient life his death will not be mourned by the church but it was not condoned by it i pray that the incantation was written by his hand and that he repented his sins before ending his life

7604173 repent and believe on the lord jesus christ and you shall be saved
7604174 therefore go and make disciples of all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit and teaching them to obey everything i have commanded you
7604175 for there is no difference between jew and gentile the same lord is lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him for everyone who calls on the name of the lord will be saved
7604176 obey your leaders and submit to their authority they keep watch over you as men who must give an account obey them so that their work will be a joy not a burden for that would be of no advantage to you
7604177 we hear that some among you are idle they are not busy they are busybodies such people we command and urge in the lord jesus christ to settle down and earn the bread they eat and as for you brothers never tire of doing what is right if anyone does not obey our instruction in this letter take special note of him do not associate with him in order that he may feel ashamed
7604178 some have rejected these and so have shipwrecked their faith among them are hymenaeus and alexander whom i have handed over to satan to be taught not to blaspheme

7604184 early in the primary she was very quiet and reserved never really spoke at events in iowa and new hampshire when i waited on her at the four seasons and told her i was going to both states for her mom she simply gave a thumbs up but didnt really speak but over the course of the campaign she really found her voice and comfort level she gets a great response from gays and with the response shes getting im suspecting that she is really enjoying us i liked her in december in april im in love with her as chelsea finds her voice she is becoming a better secret weapon for hillary than bill
7604185 ive always harbored a distrust of politicians and ive met several and they didnt really convince me it wasnt until i met barack obama and i heard him speak that i thought there was a possibility for change that somebody could actually change the paradigm or even the psychology of politics that its not just other people that are making decisions not just corporations that are making decisions but that we all have to be included in that process
7604186 i think there is a reasonably likely possibility that either one of us could end up with the popular vote and that regardless of where the pledged delegate count is it may not reflect what the overall popular vote of the election is thats something that i think will be considered
7604187 democrats should never ever be about disenfranchising voters and regardless of the rules and processes the fact is that 2 5 million people voted in these states
7604188 im a native floridian and it was the single largest turnout in primary history in the state of florida almost 1 8 million
7604189 what we have said all along is we want all the votes to be counted and there is a process in place and the process may end june 3rd it may end july 1st and rather than setting an arbitrary deadline i think it will become clear at some point in the campaign that its time for the apparent nominee to be in and for the other person to be out but i dont think were comfortable saying heres the date
7604190 well i think thats the most likely scenario but i dont know that thats going to be the case look theres a lot of focus on the campaigns going back and forth and what does this do to the nominee the greatest thing that could have ever happened to our party is a spirited contest in which 100s of thousands of new people are registering to vote as democrats hundreds of thousand of new people are coming out to vote those are all good things so i think its been a good thing just looking at it from a party perspective and i do believe when the nominee is selected and we are hoping and expecting it to be hillary that the partys going to come together
7604191 while were more than happy and thrilled to have congressmans franks support and hes been great in helping us we should not set an arbitrary deadline for when the nominee should or should not be determined

7604199 include sexual enhancement pills software adult material and luxury items such as watches jewellery and clothing
7604200 the poll highlights an inconvenient truth many of us often question ourselves why is there so much spam the answer is enough people are purchasing products from spam to make it a worthwhile and profitable endeavour for spammers
7604201 you have to consider the types of products people are buying its pirated software knock off watches counterfeit designer goods cheap drugs and prescription medicines pornography and other adult material the internet provides convenience and a degree of anonymity to people who want to buy illegal or restricted goods it is a black market and spam has become a conventional means of advertising to a willing audience of millions of people who are purchasing from spam
7604202 one of the things that i noticed was that there was a real disconnect between the gay and lesbian community and the obama campaign
7604203 i would never presume to tell any community who to vote for
7604204 i can tell you who ill vote for all i can really do is give the information and you can make up your mind for yourself because god knows i dont think ive ever met a more self determined community
7604205 really ive always harbored a distrust of politicians and ive met several and they didnt really convince me and it wasnt until i met barack obama and i heard him speak that i thought there was a possibility for change that somebody could actually change the paradigm or even the psychology of politics

7604207 i think its an extension of playing the character for so long for me i do feel myself in some ways rooted in this community and i do feel like an honorary lesbian and with the amount of visibility that i have i have a unique opportunity to advocate for change or at least recognition
7604208 i was doing press for the show and they were going to show a clip from the l word that included a love scene of sorts between me and another character and she had the audacity to say if there are any children in the room you might want to ask them to leave and my mind was blown open and i said to her if it had been a heterosexual love scene would you have asked the same question i asked her on air because i thought its important to ask it contextualizes the import of the show my feelings were hurt and it just spoke to me of what the gay and lesbian community has to deal with on a day to day basis in terms of popular media and that was when it started and i think from playing this character for so many years and becoming more aware of different political issues i would just start to read the headlines more and more my mind was truly blown open when i found out that the lgbt community was not included in federal hate crimes law i just couldnt believe it it was so infuriating to me so whenever i have the opportunity i try to stand up and say something and if im not given the opportunity i sometimes will try to create the opportunity
7604209 we talked for three and a half hours and i learned so much and i learned so much from the users questions im really excited to be a part of the community and a part of the campaign even though its in a very small way i think its really just about getting information out and determining how you feel and realizing that its not only about you but its about the well being of the group at large so here i am

7604628 often patients think psoriasis is just a rash but it is a systemic inflammatory disease with far reaching affects
7604629 patients should be aware of that and understand that controlling that systemic inflammation can help with other diseases

7604657 state law currently requires a county to convene a grand jury to inspect the county jail the illinois sheriffs association believes this requirement is a duplication of efforts because the illinois department of corrections already inspects county jails
7604658 this new law will save county government the costs of convening a grand jury for this purpose and it stands to reason that the time and resources of a grand jury are better spent on criminal matters not inspecting jails
7604659 my office initiated a new law that took effect jan 1 2008 that gives illinois one of the most comprehensive graduated driver licensing gdl programs in the nation

7604665 the al rawada rotana suites lacked confidence in traditional wireless technologies and their ability to provide sufficient coverage and bandwidth for their prestigious business and vacationing clientele without negatively impacting the day to day operations of the property
7604666 because of the thick concrete walls and sound proofed doors traditional wi fi architectures would have required too much additional hardware and cabling which would have been cost prohibitive and would have required access to all rooms to install equipment a burden not welcomed
7604667 the xirrus wi fi arrays were the exact solution we have been searching for to deliver advanced wireless capabilities to our valued guests
7604668 we had heard many mixed reviews regarding wireless solutions implemented at other hotels and we had waited and waited until finding the solution we felt would provide all the benefits we wanted this was the one
7604669 elinear was highly professional throughout the project and delivered to us a very successful project well ahead of the time constraints agreed upon
7604670 this is one of the smoothest solutions we have seen and much of that can be attributed to the professionalism and planning of elinear solutions and to the quality of the xirrus product managing this project according to elinears esp methodology was instrumental in delivering this successful project ahead of time
7604671 unlike other wi fi vendors we planned for the success of wi fi by building a high performance system that pushes the power and intelligence to the edge of the network where it needs to be
7604672 we are honored to continue to work with elinear and the rotana suites to bring the convenience and power of wireless to their clientele

7604809 under the circumstances it is difficult to avoid the impression that the cia and other intelligence agencies defended themselves against the dangers of attack from the bush administration through a process of self censorship
7604810 the net impression is that the cia white paper was rewritten to conform to administration preferences if so u s intelligence a priori made itself a tool of a political effort vitiating the intelligence function and confirming the presence of a politicized process
7604811 the specific analytic failures on iraq intelligence become much less significant in such a climate especially in that they all yielded intelligence predictions of exactly the kind the bush administration wanted to hear
7604812 bridging the gap between residential mortgage delinquencies foreclosures and losses to the structured finance cdo tranches held by banks insurance companies and other investors has proven to be a challenge for many in the marketplace

7604910 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

7604917 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas

7604920 it is important to involve as many people as possible
7604921 it doesnt mean that i wont go back and volunteer for a week or so but not to go back and run a camp i think it is important for me to take a break from working in the church now thats not to say i wont change my mind in two weeks if something else comes up its been a focus of my life and my ministry on kids and youth for so long that im getting more of those itches to go into the adult programs and see what those are about
7604922 kids that come to a place like all saints because theyre accepted regardless of how they dress or the car they drive or the people they hang out with
7604923 crossing that threshold of camp knowing that i was going to a place where i got to see people from all over the state that i might not have seen for maybe two or three months its about being in communion
7604924 i think it is one of the most important pieces of a childs development in terms of life and in terms of their relationship with christ
7604925 they have independence and create friendships that may last a lifetime
7604926 the primary reason we have summer camp is to give a true in depth experience of christian formation that can be more significant in some ways than what can happen on an average sunday morning in the parish
7604927 the second reason is that particularly in this diocese this christian formation is done in a setting that is much more racially and ethnically diverse than the typical episcopal parish
7604928 the third thing that is exceptionally important is that it is an excuse to hire college age staff a major piece of christian formation that appears around camp is the formation of young adults serving on staff
7604929 from this community of college age young people stream younger vocations in this diocese i can name five priests serving in our diocese under the age of 40 for whom their camp experience was the primary arena for the emerging sense of their call to ordination
7604930 the camp and conference program is perhaps the highest financial priority of our diocese and as bishop i find that it is the easiest fundraising challenge to put before the diocese

7604949 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo

7604980 the us and india stand shoulder to shoulder in their desire for a clean exception ahead of the scheduled nsg plenary on september 4 the united states and india will continue our vigorous joint advocacy for the initiative at the highest levels of nsg governments
7604981 last night i was called an uncle tom by emil jones in the lobby of the hotel right in front of ald freddrenna lyle and ald leslie hairston and ald latasha thomas
7604982 i walked over to him and asked him what did you just call me
7604983 if people are still making digs at the hillary clinton people because we supported her that is not going to bring us on board it makes us feel as though were outsiders and were democrats
7604984 the litmus test for being black is seen as supporting barack
7604985 you can tell the hillary clinton people they never take the buttons
7604986 i told her i never said that she may have misunderstood
7604987 that was not that was not thats all i have to say
7604988 i said then 35 000 people drank the kool aid he said barack is a clean cut guy he never liked gutter politics thats why the clintons did so and so i said i dont want to get into this so i went over to the elevator and he said uncle tom then he grabbed me and hugged me and started laughing i said what did you say i turned to freddrenna lyle and i said what did he say she wouldnt say anything thats when i said some bad things to him
7604989 calling me an uncle tom is beyond the pale especially considering where he is close with mayor daley and with gov blagojevich i am hardly the uncle tom here
7604990 who do you most identify with in the lord of the rings
7604991 no other writer in western literature has created an entire mythos
7604992 i picked up a magazine not long ago in new york that had a full age ad in it for a hotel chain
7604993 leadership is all about placing people in the right place so they can be successful
7604994 as a leader you should always challenge people to move out of their
7604995 people who are used to moving fast and flying high are easily frustrated by people who want to hold them back
7604996 hillary clintons support of barack obama is clear she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7604997 we propose continuing negotiations within the framework of the working group on wto accession but informing our partners of the need to exit some agreements which currently oppose the interests of the russian federation
7604998 it turns out that we dont feel or see any advantages from wto membership if they exist at all but we are carrying the burden we need to make this clear to our partners
7604999 i have a very honorable opponent there are stark differences between us
7605000 i know you have students who come from all over the world i know there are people here who come from countries some from iraq where they have seen the look of war and sacrifice
7605001 hes been a fighter for the hispanic community hes been a fighter for the immigration issue
7605002 martha washington was a big deal in her day dolly madison was too populism has been big in american politics from the get go in ways that it never was in canada in part because of our primary system that focuses on the individual and not the party
7605003 politics have a lot more to do with the party affiliation in canada and with the individual in the united states
7605004 you dont even have the microscopic dissection of stephen harper in canada the way we do our presidential candidates here i suppose if i thought hard i could tell you where harper went to university but everyone knows that obama went to harvard its been a major part of his story
7605005 a lot of people in traditional roles were really offended by that
7605006 and i cant imagine if laureen harper had said something similar that it would even make the news no one in canada would really care
7605007 i hope it will come as no surprise that i have something to say
7605008 she worked in the 1960s when americans were looking for some class and elegance in their presidential candidate today she wouldnt work shed be seen as elitist and out of touch
7605009 i honestly couldnt care less who scarlett johansson is supporting or that she wants to marry barack obama i mean get over yourself and show me your boobs period
7605010 its totally irrelevant what angelina jolie says about who shes voting for isnt going to affect anyone and that very irrelevancy proves that celebrities are just celebrities nothing more and that no one cares what they think even though their narcissism might have them believing otherwise
7605011 how can you live the life you lead a life of enormous riches when whoevers in power isnt going to affect you in any way oprah is not dealing with the sub prime crisis

7605028 the national front celebrated its greatest triumph in years unchallenged and unmolested they marched 1 500 strong through the city of london to great eastern street in shoreditch within spitting distance of brick lane as the nf leader richard verrall gloatingly put it
7605029 already the bengali community in spitafields is paying the price for this defeat after the nazi rally dispersed groups of fascists began prowling the area one gang of 50 60 thugs got through to brick lane and smashed up an asian shop before being driven off in several underground trains and stations black people and anti fascists were attacked by cock a hoop national front bullies the hugely boosted morale of the front will mean an escalation of racist assaults in the area and a renewed push to control the sunday market in brick lane that is the price of the fun and games in brockwell park

7605032 the british state is trying to deport us to the most dangerous country in the world we want people to listen to us it is better to be dead than to return to iraq
7605033 unions though still in the main illegal in iraq are one of the only hopes that the different political ethnic and religious groups can come together peaceful to democratically exercise national self determination
7605034 the ausiraq group an activist group in sydney initiated by members of workers liberty australia has been raising funds for the three larger union federations in iraq you may have recently met with kathy black from the us labor against the war organisation when she toured australia uslaw are among groups in many countries raising funds for a first international labour solidarity conference in iraq
7605035 we believe that the workers of iraq can form a strong front for social justice and peace if supported by our brothers and sisters in the region and around the world

7605078 asias growing economic power is attracting executives from all over the world as the united states and europe face continuing uncertainty at the same time parts of the middle east show signs of political stabilization and latin america is an ongoing bright spot
7605079 employment visas are easy to obtain for c level executives and their families moving to hong kong and singapore
7605080 support is provided with relocation costs and often accommodation is provided for the initial four to eight weeks but schooling and housing allowances are a luxury of the past
7605081 the singapore government has been the frontrunner in the region in terms of building proactive attraction of international talent in the earlier stages of their careers
7605082 in 2007 they introduced what was essentially a newly created visa category to attract young professionals from the asia pacific region who have historically turned to the united kingdom or european markets for international work experience we have yet to see similar changes in hong kong or japan
7605083 the two economies are well equipped with a range of conveniences including short term and long term serviced accommodation and international schools as well as social and business networking groups to help international professionals adjust to life in a new location
7605084 accommodation is likely to be a greater issue to the married person than to the single person

7605120 if were spending 10 billion a month in iraq we can spend 10 billion on our infrastructure
7605121 lets look at john mccains judgement mccain fell in with bush and rumsfeld and cheney on iraq
7605122 because they were quasi governmental people though the govt was probably gonna guarantee it now with the housing market collaped theyre posting billions of losses if they collapsed the financial system would suffer a body blow that would probably be disastrous freddie mac and fannie may kind of have us in the bad
7605123 id like to be able to punish them for their bad decisions but theyre too essential
7605124 we are not going through what we went through in the great depression but we have a long term problem that the income of the average family is not going up
7605125 our infrastructure is going to have to be rebuilt anyway remember that bridge in minnesota
7605126 we start winding down this war in iraq and some of that money goes to us
7605127 the great thing about infrastructure is the jobs stay here you cant build the bridge in china and ship it back here
7605128 instead of the bush admin trying to talk there was a lot of sabre rattling
7605129 as our next president and i know you will be president
7605130 i know rush limbaugh and lou dobbs say send them home but thats just not realistic

7605170 i dont want a political label but obama bears traits that resemble the anti christ and im scared to death that un educated people will ignorantly vote him into office my mom likes him because his children are well dressed
7605171 i know my stance might keep me from la jobs since almost the whole town is liberal but some time in a mans life or a bleach blonde 49 year old womans life one must stand for what they believe in and put truth before popularity

7605184 our house view is that the markets focus will shift from regional inflation risks to fears of an export slowdown
7605185 we are bearish on the global economic outlook given an unfolding credit crunch in the us and the uk sharp growth slowdowns in the eurozone and japan and a risk in our opinion of a slowdown in chinese growth thus while asia is unlikely to fall into recession an extended period of sub trend growth and high inflation appears probable
7605186 market players say the pesos value which has been moving with oil prices may again decline due to a deteriorating international payments position stemming from expensive oil imports with the depreciation trend likely occurring along with the peak in inflation rates though strengthening slightly by yearend with seasonality of remittance flows

7605234 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
7605235 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
7605236 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
7605237 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade

7605278 the postponement of champions trophy is a body blow to pakistan but since the country is run by wrong people i see more trouble for cricket in the country
7605279 the event is postponed until next year but if the current government trying to outdo musharraf stays i fear the situation could worsen rather than improve
7605280 it is not that we should not fight terrorism but the way musharraf led us into the war on terror by using gunship helicopters against our own people was fatal because as a blow back peace the economy and cricket have become casualties

7605542 the malays through umno were generous enough to relax the citizenship laws of this country to such extent that within 12 months of independence 90 percent who were still non citizens after nearly 100 years of colonial rule in the malay states obtained their citizenship in return for this major concession the mca and the mic agreed to continue the policy of preserving the special position of the malays while at the same time upholding the legitimate interest of other communities
7605543 this proved a less intractable problem because the leaders of the alliance realised the practical necessity of giving the malays a handicap if they were to compete on equal terms with the other races the only point of controversy was the duration of the special position should there be a time limit or should it be permanent i made a suggestion which was accepted that the question be left to the malays themselves because i felt that as more and more malays became educated and gained self confidence they themselves would do away with this special position because in itself this special position is a slur on the ability of the malays and only to be tolerated because it is necessary as a temporary measure to ensure their survival in the modern competitive world a world to which only those in the urban areas had been exposed

7605613 protect lives and the dignity of russian citizens wherever they are
7605614 on this issue of south ossetia and georgia we fully support russia the americans continue their cold war policies the war which was unleashed by georgia is the culmination of attempts to encircle and isolate russia
7605615 georgia started the crisis but the west is blaming russia everywhere there is total disinformation distortion of facts and international attempts to isolate russia
7605616 the caucasus and europe are impossible without russia i think that after the crisis with georgia russia has become only stronger
7605617 it is important that russia takes the position of a superpower and then all the attempts to isolate it will fail
7605618 our position is that we are ready to cooperate with russia in any project that can strengthen its security
7605619 in principle yes we have not yet thought about it

7605627 there is always stuff but as i have said maybe to you guys before and others before there is stuff about the ballpark that remains unfinished and needs to be improved but i am not going to tell you guys about it if you havent noticed i am not going to point them out for you and the same goes with stuff surrounding the team there are a lot of things we have to work on there are a lot of things we need to improve and we plan to do it all but its not something i am comfortable talking about publicly i just want to do it and the results will always be the final proof we got things done or didnt get things done
7605628 i cant tell you that for sure we continue to have talks we feel like we are not in a rush it could be next year the year after three years we really are not in a rush we want to get it right as you know at this ballpark we feel like getting our sponsors involved in an interactive way whether its the sony playstation area or the miller scoreboard walk or the pnc diamond club or the lexus presidents club we really feel like involving them some of our main real estate we have not given away like the centerfield plaza or the home run extravaganza that we still have planned or the different areas like the red loft the red porch we still have big stuff out here that we held back pending the right fit
7605629 i dont think there is a chance that it remains named that way permanently
7605630 its just a concept some whiz bang things which happens after home runs its just one of 100 things on a drawing board of possibilities we have talked about with different sponsors some sponsors want to come to us they say we would like to do this after a home run and attach our name to it but it takes many different forms thats just one thing on a menu of many possibilities
7605631 that is real estate which is still available for the right thing at the end of the day we thought lets not put a ball there we have toyed with a number of iterations of what kind of ball maybe video we just dont know but there was an awful lot to get done by opening day 08 and we now have many things we still plan to do for 09
7605632 we did we took out one row of seats the back row of the seats in front which really opened up the room there at the same time we then built the miller scoreboard bar which is great fun and on a friday night especially which we have themed out we do have one fun special event planned there for september we are planning on a speed dating event sohna and i chuckling yeah seriously we want the park to be fun and we think that is kind of a fun thing in keeping with the character of what fans are experiencing up there so we are always going to be trying fun things like that
7605633 my understanding is that they will be in for opening day 2009 i have not heard anything different
7605634 there is nothing i can tell you because there is nothing i really know they are a public company and they are in their own discussions i dont have any more information on it but it is a situation i am watching closely obviously and i am talking to other teams to see what they are experiencing other centerplate clients so we are just watching and preparing for any eventuality
7605635 well there are many different ways to do it i dont know if aramark gets it or another company gets it if they are sold at all i just dont know but we are going to insist that on what we always insist on here we are going to insist on top quality service is another important thing to me which has improved over the season although it is still not where it has to be we are going to continue to work on that whoever the concessionaire is
7605636 yes i agree with you on that its been a yearlong challenge i know it is better i know it has improved but not yet where we want it food choices i think we have more variety here than any park i have ever been to
7605637 that is our expectation to use rfk i think so nothing is finalized yet but thats our hope and our expectation
7605638 i dont know what their expectations are we need to keep working on the stadium we need to keep working on our service we need to keep working on our product all of those things are what fans deserve we will keep trying to do all we can
7605639 there werent many there will always be someone who has a problem with everything we do i think the plan we have offered is very popular and there have been next to no complaints about it
7605640 yes some tweaks i honestly dont remember what we decided i would call them tweaks i would not call them major changes i know that you follow this stuff religiously yes he does the african queen and would consider this all big and major i just dont remember i would call them tweaks we are basically still having our basic uniform
7605641 we are trying not to trash the place up with billboards i agree with that taq interesting i have never had a fan say we need more billboards chuckling i think we are exactly where we need to be the advertising in the park this year we have relationships with 125 sponsors covering many different things some have signage and some dont but we have had a really really healthy year on advertising and sponsorship very healthy
7605642 its a group party thing and its gotten a lot of use its a fun place before a game taq yes its a fun place and next year now since we will have it full time we are going to be able to program it all winter we were never sure with construction issues and all that we were never sure what we were going to do there this year we did not get it until mid season but now since we have it and know what we have know how well it going to get a heck of a lot more use next year and maybe we will use it into the game this year with very few exceptions we have cut it off at the start of each game this past weekend we let it go until 2pm for sundays game its kind of fun seeing the wrigley field type view of people hanging out and watching the game we will probably do more of that now
7605643 this is a tight footprint i have told you this before where the ballpark is we dont have a lot of extra space we struggled and struggled at first where we were going to have the tent at the first ladies night of 2008 it was outside the first base gate at the corner of potomac amp 1st street se finally when we got that space garage b its been a huge plus for us and the fans
7605644 these are among the things that are still getting done we put some drink rails out two weeks ago the drink rails themselves work fine but they were put in the wrong place at least we have model of drink rails that we know will work so we are going to put a lot more of them and we hope to have them everywhere stand up drink rails behind the seats
7605645 yes that is what i am taking about we have started to do just that and there is more of that that needs to happen weve started relocating finally more tvs into the areas that didnt have them thats taken until just this week in some cases weve been able to reconfigure check it out next home stand the portable concessions from home plate to the left field foul pole in a more functionable way these are the types of things you learn as you go along we have issues with some of them getting power water by moving some of these stands but we are getting it done now thats not something i need to tell you or anyone ahead of time but these are the things we notice all the time the drink rails the tvs the portables we are still doing it we just dont talk about the need for it
7605646 yes and some of those frankly are not well located they need to be in other places weve moved some of them beyond the right field fence those sections just got tvs this week under the scoreboard they needed them but we have more that are needed in other places
7605647 i think that was just an anomaly masn was sharing broadcasting crews all weekend since they televise both teams it was just the luck of the draw
7605648 yes i am confident that is going to be resolved in the very near future there is nothing i can really say about it other than its obviously going to get resolved to everyones satisfaction
7605649 just think of the huge ships transporting thousands of container loads of plastic over from shanghai just for our children to play in

7605725 this is a stylish monologue reminiscent of those of spalding gray excellent
7605726 braly presents it winningly with a keen sense of absurdity
7605727 an hysterically funny often profoundly affecting one man show mesmerising
7605728 a masterpiece of storytelling full of humour and pungent observation
7605729 there can be few more engaging acts on this years fringe than james braly
7605730 james braly is simply put one of the finest storytellers in new york in the tradition of john irving and spalding gray braly writes openly about the things that most of us are afraid to admit we even think with great humor and elegance he reveals complex psychological and emotional truths effectively taking us on a tour of our own inner lives
7605731 if walt whitman had been straight married and hilarious he would have been james braly
7605732 james braly is a master storyteller he appears to be so sane but that is a ruse and a fascinating one at that this calm grey maned fellow is actually losing his mind twenty four hours a day and delights in regaling his pleased and happy audiences with his absurd hyper observational perils of pauline adventures
7605733 without a scrap of sentimentality james braly manages to infuse his stories of life on the home front with humor authenticity edge and that rarest of all qualities heart
7605734 james braly has a great wife great kids and a great life which is why its great to hear him onstage admitting that the universe is making him lurch and stumble through his very own brilliant heartfelt comedy of errors and neurotic torture
7605735 the business owners we surveyed appear grounded in a circle of trust that influences their philanthropic decisions
7605736 outside of satisfying their own aspirations to do right by the community at large these business owners want validation from their family
7605737 many of our business owner clients are looking to put their personal passions and family finances to work through establishing foundations
7605738 the days of one time donations have given way to an age of corporate social responsibility marked by a more strategic consistent and targeted approach to overall giving
7605739 business owners are accustomed to looking at the bottom line in any investment decision and philanthropic giving is no different we see more business owners incorporating charitable giving into their formal financial planning as a way to ensure a lasting legacy
7605740 in doing so they want to know about an organizations track record and how successful the organization has been in achieving its goals in addition to heeding emotional cues business owners need the reassurance of a sixth sense roi

7605753 that such a large amount of fish is used for the pet food industry is real eye opener
7605754 what is also interesting is that in australia pet cats are eating an estimated 13 7 kilograms of fish a year which far exceeds the australian average human per capita fish and seafood consumption of around 11 kilograms
7605755 our pets seem to be eating better than their owners
7605756 while much of the criticism has been on the grounds that forage fish could be better used for human consumption directly particularly amongst the poorer nations of the world rather than in the production of food for farmed fish little attention has been paid to the amount of forage fish used by the pet food industry
7605757 these gourmet pet foods contain a significant amount of fish that may be suitable for direct human consumption

7605759 at previous conventions the parties and candidates would hope that the video would be shown to the television audience and if you were at home watching you might see it

7605763 this is the sort of story cooked up just to feed cable producers not an issue
7605764 that puts him in a terrible bind because you cant give a ringing endorsement when youre talking about foreign policy
7605765 obviously the hard thing to talk about with obama is commander in chief of all his many talents
7605766 you dont rah rah about commander in chief you rah rah about hope and change and a new party and all that so no matter what he does somebody will find fault with it
7605767 i think hes got a high bar because he needs to show enthusiasm and the press will be looking for any stray remark as a sign that he doesnt fully support

7605813 im tired im busy im tired im busy lather rinse repeat
7605814 whats lacking in the coverage of the afghans is the sense of the humanity of the afghans
7605815 in the prince harry coverage for example there were all these people out there you never really saw them
7605816 you knew that the bombs were dropping in that direction and the guns pointing in that direction but you never got a sense of how afghans are as a people
7605817 it may sound odd but the humanity of the taliban because the taliban are a wide very diverse group of people
7605818 some of them would like to talk to the british government some of them dont want to be fighting british troops some of them would this is the ideological taliban
7605819 we never have the ability or sometimes the desire to present this in a different way so that people would be interested its a regret
7605820 in a country which is as complex and as difficult and dangerous as afghanistan you cant really cover it properly and get the full picture unless you are there day in day out unless you are living there and feeling and eating the heat and the dust
7605821 what does it feel like to be a british soldier under fire its bloody frightening and difficult and dangerous exhilarating as well
7605822 but we also want to know what it feels like to be an afghan involved with such hopes in 2001 that things would get better and theyve got a lot worse
7605823 its a hard one because with an issue like prince harry it meant that there was a series of decisions taken all along the way journalists were one bit of a very long chain
7605824 if harry went there was no doubt that he was going to put himself and the lives of his commanders at risk
7605825 we are making these deals all the time when gordon brown goes to afghanistan we are not allowed to report perhaps it the deal wont happen again
7605826 it probably did bring a lot of people to think about afghanistan who normally wouldnt ordinarily think about afghanistan if the prince harry story can bring more people to think about afghanistan then thats a good thing
7605827 there was a lost opportunity there was hardly any mention of afghans even of afghanistan just a sense of i went to a country far away
7605828 viewing figures went up prince harry got a heros welcome and recruitment for the british army went up so an objective was achieved did that mean people knew more about why britain was there i dont think so
7605829 journalists focused on the human story but it should part of a wider picture
7605830 this new surgery is an exciting option for severely overweight patients who do not respond to diet exercise and drug therapy we hope to show that like other weight loss operations the toga procedure will help them to lose weight and improve their health
7605831 the benefits of an endoscopic approach are less pain quicker recovery shortened hospital stay and decreased complications as well as a lack of scarring
7605832 eventually toga may also be an option for patients who are unable or unwilling to undergo more invasive surgery

7605841 several republican governors expressed support during interviews saturday for bushs plan for private accounts including govs lingle of hawaii robert a taft of ohio haley barbour of mississippi tim pawlenty of minnesota and jim douglas of vermont all of whom said the idea was popular with young people in their states
7605842 minnesota gov tim pawlenty endorsed the centerpiece of president bushs second term education agenda sunday backing a plan to extend the federal no child left behind testing requirements to high schools pawlenty has been an enthusiastic supporter of no child left behind but his comments on sunday were the first time he has endorsed bushs plan to push the laws reach into the nations high schools i think minnesota could and should move in that direction the republican governor said

7605849 while most housing related indicators reveal continued problems there is some increasing evidence the supply and demand may be moving more into balance especially in many metropolitan markets in illinois
7605850 although housing news continues to dominate the business headlines the economy as a whole seems to have assumed the major position as analysts now point to the sluggish economy as the major reason for continued downward pressure on the housing markets prospects for recovery
7605851 while july typically is the slower summer month for home sales in illinois this year the drag on the housing market is amplified by overall economic uncertainty among consumers
7605852 the new tax credit enacted by the housing and economic recovery act should be a useful tool for first time homebuyers in illinois who have been waiting in the wings and who could use some financial assistance smart buyers are taking advantage of so many homes to choose from more affordable listing prices and mortgage interest rates in the mid six percent range
7605853 median price increases were recorded in 38 of 100 illinois counties reporting in july including dupage up 4 9 percent grundy up 6 0 percent jackson up 0 5 percent jo daviess up 11 1 percent macon up 5 2 percent rock island up 14 6 percent saint clair up 7 7 percent stephenson up 7 1 percent and whiteside up 2 2 percent
7605854 median prices will continue to trend downwards but at a slower rate for illinois the price declines are estimated to be 4 6 percent 3 9 percent and 2 7 percent for august september and october comparing the month in 2008 with the same month in 2007 in chicago the declines will be similar save for a slightly lower value 4 1 percent for august

7605860 assessing the effectiveness of intermediate sanctions in multnomah county oregon
7605861 heres one for you lets say theres a sick person over here and you can cure him you can do it would you help him would you try
7605862 but why not say that youd help a sick and maimed person if you could most of us would if we could but god doesnt
7605863 he doesnt does he my brother was a christian who died of cancer even though he prayed to jesus to heal him how is this jesus good hmmm can you answer that one
7605864 thats right god made satan didnt he tell me son is there evil in
7605865 evils everywhere isnt it and god did make everything correct
7605866 if god created everything then god created evil since evil exists and according to the principle that our works define who we are then god is evil
7605867 is there sickness immorality hatred ugliness all these terrible things do they exist in this world
7605868 science says you have five senses you use to identify and observe the world around you have you ever seen jesus
7605869 have you ever felt your jesus tasted your jesus or smelt your jesus have you ever had any sensory perception of jesus christ or god for that matter
7605870 according to the rules of empirical testable demonstrable protocol science says your god doesnt exist what do you say to that son
7605871 and that is the problem science has with god there is no evidence only faith
7605872 you can have lots of heat even more heat super heat mega heat unlimited heat white heat a little heat or no heat but we dont have anything called cold we can hit up to 458 degrees below zero which is no heat but we cant go any further after that there is no such thing as cold otherwise we would be able to go colder than the lowest 458 degrees
7605873 every body or object is susceptible to study when it has or transmits energy and heat is what makes a body or matter have or transmit energy absolute zero 458 f is the total absence of heat you see sir cold is only a word we use to describe the absence of heat we cannot measure cold heat we can measure in thermal units because heat is energy cold is not the opposite of heat sir just the absence of it
7605874 what about darkness professor is there such a thing as darkness
7605875 youre wrong again sir darkness is not something it is the absence of something you can have low light normal light bright light flashing light but if you have no light constantly you have nothing and its called darkness isnt it thats the meaning we use to define the word
7605876 in reality darkness isnt if it were you would be able to make darkness darker wouldnt you
7605877 yes professor my point is your philosophical premise is flawed to start with and so your conclusion must also be flawed
7605878 you argue that there is life and then theres death a good god and a bad god you are viewing the concept of god as something finite something we can measure sir science cant even explain a thought
7605879 it uses electricity and magnetism but has never seen much less fully understood either one to view death as the opposite of life is to be ignorant of the fact that death cannot exist as a substantive thing death is not the opposite of life just the absence of it
7605880 now tell me professor do you teach your students that they evolved from monkey
7605881 if you are referring to the natural evolutionary process young man yes of course i do
7605882 have you ever observed evolution with your own eyes sir
7605883 since no one has ever observed the process of evolution at work and cannot even prove that this process is an on going endeavor are you not teaching your opinion sir are you now not a scientist but a preacher
7605884 to continue the point you were making earlier to the other student let me give you an example of what i mean
7605885 is there anyone in the class who has ever seen the professors brain
7605886 is there anyone here who has ever heard the professors brain felt the professors brain touched or smelt the professors brain no one appears to have done so so according to the established rules of empirical stable demonstrable protocol science says that you have no brain with all due respect sir
7605887 so if science says you have no brain how can we trust your lectures sir
7605888 now you accept that there is faith and in fact faith exists with life
7605889 of course there is we see it every day it is in the daily example of mans inhumanity to man it is in the multitude of crime and violence everywhere in the world these manifestations are nothing else but evil
7605890 evil does not exist sir or at least it does

7605899 with kara by her side paula has some backup and now there is going to be a lot more girl power on the show
7605900 we are turning the heat up on idol this year and are thrilled to welcome kara to the judges table
7605901 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7605902 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here that they were elected to represent
7605903 that however they decide to vote we will all be united behind senator obama
7605904 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7605905 it would have been the same way if i had won and barack was here supporting the unity of the party
7605906 this was a hard fought campaign and there was a lot of intensity and passion associated with it in part because of the historic nature of our two candidacies
7605907 even before the convention and even before the complete reconciliation that we need
7605908 sometimes i think i could film two hours of a man continuously walking away from exploding buildings looking all cool and badass and punching people occasionally in slo mo and a lot of rpgnetters would feel they got their moneys worth from it

7605920 and let me state what i think of those ads im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7605921 let there be no mistake about it were united and were united for change we are after all democrats so it may take pause a while laughter were not the fall in line party were diverse many voices but make no mistake we are united we are united on behalf of the democratic party values we hold dear

7605923 ere many generations pass our machinery will be driven by a power obtainable at any point in the universe throughout space there is energy
7605924 a system is disclosed for converting energy from the electromagnetic quantum vacuum available at any point in the universe to usable energy in the form of heat electricity mechanical energy or other forms of power this process is also consistent with the conservation of energy in that all usable energy does come at the expense of the energy content of the electromagnetic quantum vacuum the disclosed devices are scalable in size and energy output for applications ranging from replacements for small batteries to power plant sized generators of electricity
7605925 these fundamental researches have made the first real and large breach in the citadel of present scientific belief

7605927 but the one size fits all approach they offer is going to leave a lot of people with loans that arent the best for them or even worse they may be shut out of the process altogether
7605928 so basically what winds up happening is that youre reduced to a number to them and if they dont like whatever that number is youre out of luck

7606168 even with gas prices falling across the state this has been a tough summer economically for many nevada families

7606194 is not as enjoyable mostly because mostow and his crew relied on numerous action scenes now this is good if the prime audience just wants to demo this disc but sometimes we wish for a few more plausible scenes that would help the story and the characters more

7606238 what we estimate is that sen obamas health plan would reduce the cost of health care by about 2 500 for a typical family thats a combination of direct out of pocket costs that the family no longer has to make and premium payments from their employers that families are now paying in the lower wages that they receive

7606253 yes weve got to find solutions we absolutely should crack down on piracy people put a lot of blood sweat and tears into their content and deserve to get paid for it its absolutely wrong it is stealing
7606254 but at the same time i think there are better solutions than chasing people for money im not sure what they are other than to build game experiences that make it more difficult for there to be any value in pirating games
7606255 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time

7606285 my journey to the priesthood taught me to realize how important it is to be humble and realize our own limitations

7606287 i literally went from the classroom to the altar during the week and often let my students know they were being dismissed since i could not keep god waiting
7606288 i became inspired by my course work in sacred theology and so i began developing content for segments
7606289 quite a few doors swung open once i finished the program they still do
7606290 i have a drive to inform the public about reputable charities and also raise awareness about causes close to my heart
7606291 i worked closely with the priest in charge of my parish and found he often allowed me little time to prepare sermons and special devotions and events the work ethic i developed in acting gave me confidence to follow through but more importantly gods grace was with me during those hectic times

7606302 au erdem kann sich der eine oder andere zuletzt angeschlagene spieler spielpraxis sichern
7606303 in diesem spiel geht es um alles oder nichts wir werden versuchen eine topleistung abzurufen und das spiel zu gewinnen
7606304 es ist eine gro artige chance in nur 90 minuten einen titel zu gewinnen es erschien mir damals kein allzu wichtiges spiel zu sein aber das hat sich ge ndert hoffentlich komme ich in dieser saison erstmals zum einsatz wir werden sehen wie es im training l uft denn mit diesem problem habe ich seit 16 monaten zu k mpfen

7606316 corporation tax is an important source of revenue for government and in times of global economic downturn issues surrounding taxation become ever more pertinent
7606317 the irish government has made a guarantee that the 12 5pc rate of corporation tax will remain consideration must be given however to how best the tax system can encourage economic activity while funding necessary public services and assisting government in meeting its social objectives
7606318 we have had complications with the printers which have caused a delay in production we hope to remedy it by next week at the latest and once we go to print and handle that situation checks will be sent out sorry for the delay in response we are very busy trying to fix the publication schedule we will be running the launch for 2 months due to the delay as well
7606319 a previously unknown indian hacker successfully breached the it defenses of the best western hotel groups online booking system and sold details of how to access it through an underground network operated by the russian mafia
7606320 we have found no evidence to support the sensational claims ultimately made by the reporter and newspaper
7606321 most importantly whereas the reporter asserted the recent compromise of data for past guests from as far back as 2007 best western purges all online reservations promptly upon guest departure
7606322 there was one instance of suspicious activity at a single hotel with respect to 13 guests who are being notified we are working with the fbi and international authorities to investigate the source of the other claims which were never presented to us for investigation prior to publication of the herald story we have found no suspicious activity to support them

7606327 ordered an investigation into mounting allegations that chinese authorities covered up the true age of their gold winning gymnastics star because she was too young to compete
7606328 for a year we couldnt sell anything that we produced because people said they were made by the untouchable scavengers
7606329 we make pickles vermicelli and papad spicy savouries at home too which gets us an additional income of around rs 2 000 per month
7606330 initially we didnt believe dr pathak we couldnt believe anyone could liberate us from this age old practice but a few months after his alwar visit he invited us to delhi for the world toilet summit and put us up at the five star maurya sheraton hotel the organisation also gave us rs 200 as travelling allowance when we returned to alwar we were sure our life was going to change forever
7606331 most of us are now literate some of us can even speak a few words of english we now send our children to english medium schools earlier we didnt have any say in such affairs the family decided where our children would go for their schooling the centre has given us dreams and we want to realise them
7606332 we could never ever dream that such a thing could happen to us what happened in new york was much beyond our dreams
7606333 less clothes and more exposed bodies our men would never let us wear such clothes and step out to work
7606334 the ims act aims to curtail misinformation and misdirected education of pregnant women and mothers of infants about breastfeeding and prohibits contact between industry and pregnant women or mothers of infants instead of just regulating the baby food industry the act also mandates creating awareness among pregnant women and lactating mothers about the benefits of breastfeeding when read with other laws like the maternity benefit act the law could adequately serve to increase breastfeeding
7606335 the act empowers four ngos including bpni to prosecute erring companies in addition to health officers but the government has done little in the way of budgetary allocation or legal support system though we have initiated the case it is the state which is prosecuting nestle it is therefore very important to establish a good coordination between the government and ngo arm to implement this act
7606336 in the first place the mother and babies are exposed to pain killers at birth and the feeding does not start off immediately in some cases only as late as 3 days to compensate the staff give formula or water in a bottle and send breastfeeding downhill by causing nipple confusion c sections are very common and mothers are often not helped to establish breastfeeding immediately when they return home they are exposed to more taboos and misinformation and many seek help as late as 5 months after delivery
7606337 i am surprised at the numbers of women that look online for breastfeeding help when help should be available to mothers at hospitals
7606338 our greatest challenge has been in trying to convince women that the colostrum produced on days 1 2 and 3 after delivery have immunological properties and should be given to children instead of being thrown away as milk gone bad we also need to break social taboos like women not nursing in the presence of elders in the family and fad diets that are nutritionally poor
7606339 we have been asked to push kangaroo care where the mother and child get a lot of skin to skin contact in newborns we often have to come up with creative solutions that will work in a paternalistic society where such practices would be precluded
7606340 all the work we do in getting women to provide nutritionally the best food goes waste because mothers have to return to work to supplement family income the supervisors forbid women from taking nursing breaks or from bringing infants to worksite having to provide the extra income mothers often abandon exclusive breastfeeding by three months so that they can return to workforce
7606341 for this to be possible all offices should have creches and day care facilities often women are forced to give up on their maternity privileges in the increasingly corporatised and contractualised work place and the one who pays the price is the infant

7606354 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7606355 no one wants to protect social security numbers more than the aclu and b j ostergren but the government cant carelessly put social security numbers online and then tell the public what they can and cannot do with those numbers
7606356 thats censorship and the court was quick to recognize that
7606357 in the end it appears this law was passed not for the purpose of protecting social security numbers but to silence a critic of the states failure to protect such numbers from identity thieves
7606358 it is difficult to imagine a more archetypal instance of the press informing the public of government operations through government records than ostergrens posting of public records to demonstrate the lack of care being taken by the government to protect the private information of individuals

7606365 the council has said they didnt want to have layoffs but personnel is 83 percent of the police departments budget

7606412 i think mobile banking is maybe one application where some of that knowledge will come back and be used in different ways here
7606413 here i can walk into a branch very easily drive to a cash machine do internet banking or telephone banking and mobile banking now whereas if im in northern vietnam for example mobile may be my only means of access without traveling two hours to a bank it just makes it more convenient
7606414 mobile is often a key access point for end users in emerging markets
7606415 that is probably where the greatest traction is at the moment driven by greatest necessity people want access to financial services and they do want to be able to transfer money either internationally or nationally between friends and relatives for that reason the mobile penetration is far higher than other banks and the presence is much greater

7606428 how will we drink tea if the left side of our face is levitating
7606429 theres a rep from the association to explain the procedure
7606430 you really have to make an effort to keep up with the memos
7606431 yeah we love tea but only when we feel like it
7606432 there has to be an order of things a control of tea time rules on bitter

7606445 a phony sense of balance sometimes there arent two sides to a story
7606446 theyre both being negative but theyre not being negative in the same way obamas had 2 ads that stretch the truth mccains had like 10 how do we convey that without seeming biased
7606447 the reason that the press lost credibility is that they lost credibility for years weve gone through these events that the press cheerled the way through the impeachment of bill clinton the 2000 election and the iraq war we were sold a list of goods and the press helped sell it
7606448 your television ads keep saying things that are not true and you have refused to accept my proposals to have a debate
7606449 we need to stand in public and be truthful this is a public building its paid for by taxpayers money and so there is no reason no reason at all that you cannot agree now to a debate
7606450 when we can arrange our schedule we will meet for a debate
7606451 i have a job to do were not going to do it on your demands we have said publicly when we can arrange our schedule we will meet were not going to do it on your demands not here or there ok i expect the invitations soon
7606452 we have both received invitations but kuhl has not responded
7606453 some people want to be disrespectful and want to be interuptive for their own political gain
7606454 this event was not campaign related and it was shamefully and frankly sad that massa tried to turn the attention away from our first responders and back to himself
7606455 and the time for action is now the energy issue is the most critical our country has economically i hope changes will come before the end of the year
7606456 i understand you are trying to make this a political issue but youre not going to
7606457 he said this wasnt a political event today but his only staffer there was his campaign manager
7606458 kuhl has stopped his town hall meetings wont take questions from the public and refuses to respond to invitations to debate the issues of the day
7606459 all i can do is be me whoever that is
7606460 from the producers of paris je taime comes new york i love you another anthology of 12 short films this time focusing on the stories of love in new yorks five boroughs

7606462 queremos que la gente se asegure de qui n es el senador obama y d nde quiere llevar al pa s y dos deseamos que los votantes conozcan sus opciones en esta elecci n entre obama que quiere cambiar radicalmente la forma en la que se hacen negocios en washington y john mccain que es m s de lo mismo que hemos tenido en los ltimos ocho a os
7606463 obama no ha tomado una distancia clara sobre mccain en un a o que debiera ser f cil para un candidato dem crata
7606464 creo que el pa s todav a quiere saber qui n es barack obama y ad nde quiere llevar al pa s en una direcci n m s espec fica que la que ya dio
7606465 no puede perder el mantra del cambio pero debe mantener sus acusaciones contra mccain
7606466 lo principal es quieren otros cuatro a os cuando la gente dejen la convenci n necesitan haber evaluado y respondido a esa pregunta
7606467 se trata de una gran ejercicio propagand stico es la oportunidad de los partidos para mostrar a su candidato sin pagar en comerciales de televisi n
7606468 es verdad que se han convertido en un espect culo y ya no tienen el objetivo con el que nacieron que era elegir al candidato pero tienen ahora otro tipo de funci n
7606469 la gente estaba cansada deque los l deres escogieran al candidato sin que hubiera una participaci n m s democr tica es por eso que se iniciaron los caucus y las primarias para que todo los miembros del partido en el pa s pudieran dar su opini n
7606470 la convenciones costar n cada una us 60 millones y gran parte del dinero se ha logrado recaudar con contribuciones de qui nes de grandes empresas y grupos de inter s algunas compa as han donado hasta us 6 millones de d lares

7606472 all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing
7606473 the keating five were five united states senators accused of corruption in 1989 igniting a major political scandal as part of the larger savings and loan crisis of the late 1980s and early 1990s
7606474 one of our jobs as elected officials is to help constituents in a proper fashion acc is a big employer and important to the local economy i wouldnt want any special favors for them i dont want any part of our conversation to be improper
7606475 to be blunt you should charge them or get off their backs
7606476 whats wrong with this if theyre willing to clean up their act its very unusual for us to have a company that could be put out of business by its regulators
7606477 i want to say in the most forceful way i can i certainly hope so
7606478 the fullest strongest and most severe sanction which the committee has the authority to impose
7606479 the senate select committee on ethics on behalf of and in the name of the united states senate does hereby strongly and severely reprimand sen alan cranston
7606480 actions were not improper nor attended with gross negligence and did not reach the level of requiring institutional action against him senator mccain has violated no law of the united states or specific rule of the united states senate
7606481 the appearance of it was wrong its a wrong appearance when a group of senators appear in a meeting with a group of regulators because it conveys the impression of undue and improper influence and it was the wrong thing to do
7606482 the u s senate remains on the auction block to the charles keatings of the world
7606483 let four of the infamous keating five off with a wrist tap
7606484 all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing

7606495 tokyo is a shining star in the world of cuisine
7606496 we found the citys restaurants to be excellent featuring the best ingredients culinary talents and a tradition passed on from generation to generation and refined by todays chefs
7606497 there are a lot of great cities in the world
7606498 tokyo is an exciting place to eat but paris is an exciting place to eat so is rome
7606499 i dont think it is helpful to make that kind of statement
7606500 tokyo has the best japanese food in the world but it is nowhere near as diverse as other cities
7606501 tokyo ii mise umai mise tokyo good restaurant delicious restaurant
7606502 i think we can call it the culinary capital of the world
7606503 if you try any cuisine its hard to go wrong in tokyo
7606504 you can find many places that are not publicized at all but are still good especially when you are travelling rural europe
7606505 it was very scrappy we both never really got scoring my safety game was really poor and i kept leaving him with easy balls it got a bit frustrating in the end
7606506 i just love playing but it does get frustrating when youre playing well and you dont produce it on the match table
7606507 your safety is a huge part of your game if you dont get that going then youll find it hard to score
7606508 ive always supported him and got on well with him
7606509 i know hes been struggling in the last two years but its still tough to play him
7606510 hes obviously hitting the ball better than he has done for a couple of years and i think he can get back up the rankings
7606511 i took time to settle today but having got a win and a bit of confidence hopefully ill feel more relaxed in my next match
7606512 my big target for the season is to get back into the top 16 and i start 18th provisionally so that is realistic
7606513 obviously things are a lot different for me being here but its just a nice opportunity to get out there and skate with the guys well see what happens come camp time
7606514 obviously i didnt play last year i kind of thought there was a possibility his career could be over
7606515 but i got married in april and weve got a baby on the way now and i thought id give it another shot
7606516 the more things change the more they stay the same
7606517 if you wont save me please dont waste my time
7606518 when i joined step up i thought i was going to just be doing some volunteer work having the opportunity to help them along on that journey of self discovery has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life
7606519 when i joined step up i thought i was going to just be doing some volunteer work having the opportunity to help them along on that journey of self discovery has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life

7606525 the waves of death encompassed me the torrents of destruction assailed me this god his way is perfect
7606526 the lord gave and the lord has taken away blessed be the name of the lord
7606527 comforted him for all the evil that the lord had brought upon him
7606528 shall we receive good from god and shall we not receive evil
7606529 who shut in the sea with doors when it burst out from the womb and said thus far shall you come and no farther and here shall your proud waves be stayed
7606530 o lord you rule the raging of the sea when its waves rise you still them
7606531 he rebuked the wind and the raging waves and they ceased and there was a calm
7606532 the creation was subjected to futility not willingly but because of him who subjected it in hope
7606533 not only the creation but we ourselves who have the firstfruits of the spirit groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for adoption as sons the redemption of our bodies
7606534 preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison
7606535 it is time for judgment to begin at the household of god and if it begins with us what will be the outcome for those who do not obey the gospel of god
7606536 love your enemies do good to those who hate you

7606548 we just end up seeing it on a billboard somewhere
7606549 but i think that its smart and its fine and its cool
7606550 weve looked at several ways to play anticipated growth in wind energy weve also considered titanium makers for that industrys ties to the production of lightweight modern aircraft
7606551 while the two trends might not appear to have much in common at first glance hxl offers a way to play both the aircraft and wind markets
7606552 the connection is the lightweight composite materials hexcel makes that are used by producers in both sectors hexcel develops and manufactures advanced structural materials
7606553 it is the largest u s producer of carbon fiber the worlds largest weaver of reinforcement fabrics and the number one producer of composite materials
7606554 its product was initially developed for the aerospace industry but is now used in a wide range of applications from golf clubs to satellite arrays and from the rotor blades of wind turbines to life saving monocoques for formula 1 race cars
7606555 its been a rollercoaster ride for hexcels stock in the past 12 months the shares hit their one year peak of 27 19 in december 2007 by january 22nd they had plummeted to 17 the shares rebounded through may only to fade again year to date hxl is off about 15
7606556 second quarter profits came in shy of wall streets expectations as a result of costs associated with the start up of four overseas manufacturing plants and a weak u s dollar the reason hexcel has been investing in plants in europe is to be closer to customers such as airbus
7606557 hexcel just won a big order from airbus that was the biggest in the companys history
7606558 hexcel is in a great position to profit from the growing investment in wind energy platforms and the demand for lighter weight more fuel efficient airplanes the skyrocketing price of crude during q2 did much to disrupt the plans of cash strapped airlines to acquire the new planes
7606559 boeings delays getting the dreamliner in the air have also been well documented those are short term problems however long term it is inevitable that air carriers will want these newer planes in their fleets
7606560 wind energy is obviously a hot topic too oilman boone pickens is pushing wind farms as an alternative to oil fired power plants al gores alliance for climate protection meanwhile has promoted them as an anecdote to greenhouse gas emissions
7606561 when two guys like gore and pickens coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum can come to the same view theres some karma happening
7606562 a strong dollar should help hexcels cost structure in its overseas plants and could well lead to an earnings surprise in the second half of the year if the trend continues this is a stock to keep on our radar
7606563 why does it always snow when im going to talk about global warming
7606564 sydneys largest dam warragamba has received 43mm of rain since thursday while the regions smaller dams got a better soaking including the upper nepean which got 108mm
7606565 the water problem is so severe for adelaide that it may run out of water by early 2009
7606566 the stakes of this election will be made very clear
7606567 the end of the republican party as they know it
7606568 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
7606569 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
7606570 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
7606571 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
7606572 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
7606573 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
7606574 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7606575 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
7606576 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
7606577 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7606578 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
7606579 there used to be an organization for people who believed in a truly limited government limited taxes limited spending limited interference in individual lives and limited intervention in foreign affairs that organization was known as the republican party but the only one of those beliefs that still motivates the g o p establishment is limited taxes
7606580 the fast turnaround and extra attention they paid to my submissions was well worth the money
7606581 i received calls from people interested in my new business within hours of paying for a submission
7606582 the need to have an accurate inventory of your businesses fixed assets or your homes contents is essential in todays day and age disasters are happening on a global scale and more people need to be prepared no matter where they live because you cant predict when it will strike you
7606583 the systems that generate elections and earthquakes are complex systems
7606584 they are not predictable by simple equations but after coarse graining averaging they become predictable
7606585 we didnt look at it as reagan versus carter or republicans versus democrats or liberals versus conservatives rather we looked at elections as stability versus upheavals
7606586 shook his fist in wrath as he walked the platform a white foam gathered upon his lips giving him a look of ferocity
7606587 does mr lincoln wish to push these things to the point of personal difficulties here douglas demanded backing around and shaking his clenched fist within a few inches of lincolns face
7606588 made him look like humpty dumpty in a toupee while lincolns height was largely in his legs and gave audiences the impression of a scarecrow come to life
7606589 this government was made by our fathers on the white basis
7606590 by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever
7606591 when lincoln rose to take the oath and discovered that he had no place to rest his top hat douglas obligingly stepped forward and held it for him
7606592 a sad heart with a grief that i have never before experienced
7606593 the richest person is the one who is contented with what he has
7606594 family is shaping the content of the entire day and thats not been done before
7606595 he let me know the world was large and that i should get to know as much of it as possible
7606596 they want to contrast the story of obama who has been through struggles that many americans are now facing with mccain who seems increasingly out of touch
7606597 filled with black rage against white people and hatred of the united states
7606598 the challenge is to avoid anything that smacks of angry black woman and get her back into the kitchen the question is whether she is willing to go along with that
7606599 she is bright and she is gifted but she also has a healthily ordinary attitude towards her family that american voters will respond to
7606600 make people aware of the kind of sacrifice barack made to give a voice to people who had all but given up hope
7606601 disease investigators from the osdh tulsa health department and several northeastern oklahoma county health departments are looking at all likely sources including restaurants and specific food sources

7606611 im convinced he has a sexual addiction he needs to get help for his sake he has already damaged his presidency beyond repair
7606612 when truman boarded a train january 1953 at union station without a penny in federal largesse except a microscopic army pension the president knew he would have to sell some property and would even have to dip into his own pocket to buy stamps to answer the 72 000 pieces of mail he received in just the first two weeks after he left the white house
7606613 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
7606614 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
7606615 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily
7606616 john mccain would be stronger against gore gore will be a dull unspiring loser candidate for the democrats mccain looks stronger he is stronger mccain because of his military service and vietnam prisoner of war hero status you know he had a hehluva military record
7606617 bush has that air reserve texas national guard record of course gores war record in vietnam aint much either
7606618 wanneer we ons echter baseren op de ondertekende compromissen op dit ogenblik stellen we vast dat de marktprijzen eerder stagneren
7606619 de stijging spreekt zeker de mening van vastgoedanalisten tegen die het eerder hebben over een daling van de vastgoedprijzen hun conclusie wordt bevestigd wanneer we de cijfers van het 1ste semester van 2008 vergelijken met de gegevens van het 2de semester van 2007 hieruit blijkt dat de vastgoedprijzen op dit ogenblik minder snel stijgen dan de inflatie geschat op 4 8 procent tot 5 procent voor 2008 hetgeen dus zelfs neerkomt op een lichte daling van de vastgoedprijzen in re le termen
7606620 de vastgoedprijzen in vlaanderen zullen niet spectaculair stijgen of dalen eerder stabiliseren voor een openspatten van de vastgoedbel zoals bijvoorbeeld in de verenigde staten hoeven we zeker niet te vrezen

7606667 there is something more than just the reduction in driving that has to be brought in as an explanation for the huge drop in fatalities
7606668 its really very interesting that with all these efforts that have gone into building safer highways safer cars better enforcement this really dramatic change were seeing is due to economics to the price of gasoline
7606669 this is really the first time since the 1970s that people are thinking about driving and about what is the cost of an individual trip
7606670 i wasnt even in the city of new york on that saturday

7606673 hello george this is ron reagan id like to go over to the convention and announce that youre my choice for vice president if thats alright with you
7606674 except in three cases that of their wives their daughters and their girlfriends
7606675 nancy unwilling to stand up for womens pro choice beliefs
7606676 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7606677 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7606678 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7606679 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7606680 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
7606681 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
7606682 whether someone helps win you an election i think is kind of a side benefit you certainly want to pick someone who doesnt hurt you
7606683 a group or a member of such a group or class enjoying intellectual social or economic status the best or most skilled members of a group
7606684 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7606685 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7606686 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7606687 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7606688 a nashville based free market think tank and watchdog organization
7606689 its easy i think of a man and i take away reason and accountability
7606690 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
7606691 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
7606692 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
7606693 getting away with murder how politics is destroying the criminal justice system
7606694 making the case for yourself a diet book for smart women
7606695 with the possible exception of al gore i cant think of someone who generates as much excitement
7606696 mccain was the same for nearly seventy years then he changed
7606697 claiming that mccain suddenly transformed into a different bad man is not plausible
7606698 launching implausible negative attacks is not the new politics weve been promised
7606699 its not just something biden is making up back during the primaries i remember talking to a lot of people about how i thought the 2000 version of mccain might have made a pretty good president but the 2008 model not so much but then the 2000 version would never have won the republican nomination which is why he moved so far to the right
7606700 i think bidens gaffes tend to be pretty superficial they dont reflect a fundamental lack of knowledge or empathy far from it so much as a certain ham fistedness in putting words together this is almost entirely forgivable and unlikely to create long term problems
7606701 i voted for the bill before i voted against it
7606702 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope
7606703 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling
7606704 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7606705 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7606706 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7606707 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7606708 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7606709 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7606710 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7606711 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7606712 this is the paradox of the successful social activist as they get closer to achieving their goal
7606713 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate

7606731 most sensible people have realized that there is significant improvement on all the counts for which we have been criticized like our ability to do things our concern for the environment and for human rights
7606732 dont quote me but i really think china has made this possible precisely because of its centralized political structure
7606733 the olympic games will have a lot of positive effect the chinese government will care a lot more about the need for harmony in society i expect it to be more responsive to the problems of ethnic communities
7606734 the glory goes to the olympic family to athletes who have competed hard to volunteers from different parts of the world and to friends the world over who have been involved in the beijing olympic games in various ways
7606735 the most intangible legacy but also very important one is that through the games china has been scrutinized by the world has opened up to the world
7606736 the world has learned about china and china has learned about the world i believe this is something that will have positive effects in the long term
7606737 o foolish ones and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken was it not necessary that the christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory
7606738 you search the scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life and
7606739 now the birth of jesus christ was on this wise when his mother mary was espoused to joseph before they came together she was found with child of the holy ghost
7606740 then joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privately
7606741 and while he thought of these things that is whether he should put her away privately or make a public example of her behold the angel of the lord appeared to him in a dream that is joseph dreamed that an angel appeared unto him saying joseph thou son of david fear not to take unto thee mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the holy ghost and she shall bring forth a son and call his name jesus for he shall save his people from their sins
7606742 for to us a child is born to us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counselor mighty god everlasting father prince of peace
7606743 now says he all this that is all this dreaming and this pregnancy was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord by the prophet saying behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name emmanuel which being interpreted is god with us
7606744 as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness so must the son of man be lifted up that whoever believes in him may have eternal life
7606745 their hearts were moved as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind
7606746 therefore the lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son butter and honey shall he eat that he may know to refuse the evil and chose the good for before the child shall know to refuse the evil and chose the good the land which thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings
7606747 and i took unto me faithful witnesses to record uriah the priest and zechariah the son of jeberechiah and i went unto the prophetess and she conceived and bear a son and he says at ver
7606748 behold i and the children whom the lord hath given me are for signs and for wonders in israel
7606749 behold a young woman is with child and beareth a son
7606750 now when jesus was born in bethlehem of judea in the days of herod the king behold there came wise men from the east to jerusalem saying where is he that is born king of the jews for we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship him when herod the king heard these things he was troubled and all jerusalem with him and when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together he demanded of them where christ should be born and they said unto him in bethlehem in the land of judea for thus it is written by the prophet and thou bethlehem in the land of judea ant not the least among the princes of judah for out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule my people israel
7606751 and this man shall be the peace when the assyrian shall come into our land and when he shall tread in our palaces then shall we raise up against him that is against the assyrian seven shepherds and eight principal men and they shall waste the land of assyria with the sword and the land of nimrod on the entrance thereof thus shall he the person spoken of at the head of the second verse deliver us from the assyrian when he cometh into our land and when be treadeth within our borders
7606752 the angel of the lord appeared to joseph in a dream saying arise and take the young child and his mother and flee into egypt and be thou there until i bring thee word for herod will seek the life of the young child to destroy him when he arose he took the young child and his mother by night and departed into egypt and was there until the death of herod that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord by the prophet saying out of egypt have i called my son
7606753 when israel was a child then i loved him and called my son out of egypt as they called them so they went from them they sacrificed unto baalim and burnt incense to graven images
7606754 then was fulfilled that which was spoken by jeremy the prophet saying in ramah was there a voice heard lamentation and weeping and great mourning rachel weeping for her children and would not be comforted because they were not
7606755 thus saith the lord a voice was heard in ramah it is in the preter tense lamentation and bitter weeping rachel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children because they were not
7606756 thus saith the lord refrain thy voice from weeping and thine eyes from tears for thy work shall be rewarded saith the lord and they shall come again from the land of the enemy
7606757 and there is hope in thine end saith the lord that thy children shall come again to their own border
7606758 but when herod was dead behold an angel of the lord appeared in a dream to joseph in egypt saying arise and take the young child and his mother and go into the land of israel for they are dead which sought the young childs life and he arose and took the young child and his mother and came into the land of israel but when he heard that archelaus did reign in judea in the room of his father herod he was afraid to go thither notwithstanding being warned of god in a dream here is another dream he turned aside into the parts of galilee and he came and dwelt in a city called nazareth that it might be fulfilled which was spoke by the prophets he shall be called a nazarene
7606759 now when jesus heard that john was cast into prison he departed into galilee and leaving nazareth he came and dwelt in capernaum which is upon the sea coast in the borders of zebulon and nephthalim that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by esaias isaiah the prophet saying the land of zebulon and the land of nephthalim by the way of the sea beyond jordan galilee of the gentiles the people which sat in the region and shadow of death light is springing upon them
7606760 nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of zebulon and the land of naphtali and afterwards did more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea beyond jordan in galilee of the nations
7606761 nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of zebulon and the land of naphtali and did afterwards more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea beyond jordan in galilee of the nations
7606762 the people that walked in darkness have seen a great light they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death upon them hath the light shined
7606763 when the evening was come they brought unto him jesus many that were possessed with devils and he cast out the spirits with his word and healed all that were sick that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by esaias isaiah the prophet saying himself took our infirmities and bare our sickness
7606764 surely he the person of whom isaiah is speaking hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows
7606765 but as for me i was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the slaughter
7606766 then the pharisees went out and held a council against him how they might destroy him but when jesus knew it he withdrew himself and great numbers followed him and he healed them all and he charged them they should not make him known that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by esaias isaiah the prophet saying behold my servant whom i have chosen my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased i will put my spirit upon him and he shall shew judgment to the gentiles he shall not strive nor cry neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets a bruised reed shall he not break and smocking flax shall he not quench till he send forth judgment unto victory and in his name shall the gentiles trust
7606767 he shall not fail nor be discouraged till he have set judgment in the earth and the isles shall wait for his law
7606768 that saith of cyrus he is my shepherd and shall perform all my pleasure even saying to jerusaalm thou shalt be built and to the temple thy foundation shall be laid thus saith the lard to his anointed to cyrus whose right hand i have holden to subdue nations before him and i will loose the loins of kings to open before him the two leaved gates and the gates shall not be shut
7606769 and when they drew nigh unto jerusalem and were come to bethphage unto the mount of olives then jesus sent two of his disciples saying unto them go into the village over against you and straightway ye shall find an ass tied and a colt with her loose them and bring them unto me and if any man say ought to you ye shall say the lord hath need of them and straightway he will send them all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying tell ye the daughter of sion behold thy king cometh unto thee meek and sitting upon an ass and a colt the foal of an ass
7606770 i saw by night zechariah was a sharp sighted seer and behold a man setting on a red horse yes reader a red horse and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom and behind him were red horses speckled and white
7606771 therefore thus saith the lord i am returned to jerusalem with mercies my house shall be built in it saith the lord of hosts and a line shall be stretched forth upon jerusalem
7606772 had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts and they had thirty cities
7606773 and behold one of them which was with jesus meaning peter stretched out his hand and drew his sword and struck a servant of the high priest and smote off his ear then said jesus unto him put up again thy sword into its place for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword thinkest thou that i cannot now pray to my father and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels but how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be in that same hour jesus said to the multitudes are ye come out as against a thief with swords and with staves for to take me i sat daily with you teaching in the temple and ye laid no hold on me but all this was done that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled
7606774 then judas which had betrayed him when he saw that he was condemned repented himself and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders saying i have sinned in that i have betrayed the innocent blood and they said what is that to us see thou to that and he cast down the thirty pieces of silver and departed and went and hanged himself and the chief priests took the silver pieces and said it is not lawful to put them in the treasury because it is the price of blood and they took counsel and bought with them the potters field to bury strangers in wherefore that field is called the field of blood unto this day then was fulfilled that which was spoken by jeremiah the prophet saying and they took the thirty pieces of silver the price of him that was valued whom they of the children of israel did value and gave them for the potters field as the lord appointed me
7606775 and jeremiah said the word of the lord came unto me saying behold hanameel the son of shallum thine uncle shall come unto thee saying buy thee my field that is in anathoth for the right of redemption is thine to buy it so hanameel mine uncles son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the lord and said unto me buy my field i pray thee that is in anathoth which is in the country of benjamin for the right of inheritance is thine and the redemption is thine buy it for thyself then i knew this was the word of the lord and i bought the field of hanameel mine uncles son that was in anathoth and weighed him the money even seventeen shekels of silver and i subscribed the evidence and sealed it and took witnesses and weighed him the money in the balances so i took the evidence of the purchase both that which was sealed according to the law and custom and that which was open and i gave the evidence of the purchase unto baruch the son of neriah the son of maaseiah in the sight of hanameel mine uncles son and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase before all the jews that sat in the court of the prison and i charged baruch before them saying thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel take these evidences this evidence of the purchase both which is sealed and this evidence which is open and put them in an earthen vessel that they may continue many days for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land
7606776 and i will feed the flock of slaughter even you o poor of the flock and i took unto me two staves the one i called beauty and the other i called bands and i fed the flock three shepherds also i cut off in one month and my soul loathed them and their soul also abhorred me then said i i will not feed you that which dieth let it die and that which is to be cut off let it be cut off and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another and i took my staff even beauty and cut it asunder that i might break my covenant which i had made with all the people and it was broken in that day and so the poor of the flock who waited upon me knew that it was the word of the lord and i said unto them if ye think good give me my price and if not forbear so they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver and the lord said unto me cast it unto the potter a goodly price that i was prised at of them and i took the thirty pieces of silver and cast them to the potter in the house of the lord then i cut asunder mine other staff even bands that i might break the brotherhood between judah and israel
7606777 men and brethren this scripture must needs have been fulfilled which the holy ghost by the mouth of david spoke before concerning judas which was guide to them that took jesus david says not a word about judas for he judas was numbered among us and obtained part of our ministry now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity and falling headlong he burst asunder in the midst and his bowels gushed out
7606778 and they crucified him and parted his garments casting lots that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet they parted my garments among them and upon my vesture did they cast lots
7606779 they parted my garments among them and cast lots upon my vesture
7606780 the foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests but the son of man hath not where to lay his head
7606781 the beginning of the gospel of jesus christ the son of god as it is written in the prophets behold i send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee
7606782 behold i will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me
7606783 but who may abide the day of his coming and who shall stand when he appeareth for he is like a refiners fire and like fullers soap
7606784 the day cometh that shall burn like an oven and all the proud yea and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day cometh that shall burn them up saith the lord of hosts that it shall leave them neither root nor branch
7606785 behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord
7606786 behold i send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee
7606787 the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make his paths straight
7606788 the voice of him that cryeth in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make his paths straight
7606789 and the voice said cry and he said what shall i cry all flesh is grass
7606790 go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned fine popish stuff this and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover
7606791 the same day there came certain of the pharisees saying unto him jesus get thee out and depart hence for herod will kill thee and he said unto them go ye and tell that fox behold i cast out devils and i do cures to day and to morrow and the third day i shall be perfected
7606792 and jesus began to be about thirty years of age being as was supposed the son of joseph
7606793 for had ye believed moses ye would have believed me for he wrote of me
7606794 for moses truly said unto the fathers a prophet shall the lord your god raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you
7606795 and the lord said unto moses get thee up into this mount abarim and see the land which i have given unto the children of israel and when thou hast seen it thou also shalt be gathered unto thy people as aaron thy brother is gathered
7606796 and moses spoke unto the lord saying let the lord the god of the spirits of all flesh set a man over the congregation which may go out before them and which may go in before them and which may lead them out and which may bring them in that the congregation of the lord be not as sheep that have no shepherd and the lord said unto moses take thee oshua the son of nun a man in whom is the spirit and lay thine hand upon him and set him before eleazar the priest and before all the congregation and give him a charge in their sight and thou shalt put some of thine honor upon him that all the congregation of the children of israel may be obedient
7606797 and moses did as the lord commanded him and he took joshua and set him before eleazar the priest and before all the congregation and he laid hands upon him and gave him a charge as the lord commanded by the hand of moses
7606798 the lord shall raise thee up a prophet like unto me
7606799 then came the soldiers and brake the legs of the first meaning one of the thieves and of the other which was crucified with him but when they came to jesus and saw that he was dead already they brake not his legs
7606800 for these things were done that the scripture should be fulfilled a bone of him shall not be broken
7606801 your lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year ye shall take it from the sheep or from the goats
7606802 and the lord said unto moses and aaron this is the ordinance of the passover there shall no stranger eat thereof but every mans servant that is bought for money when thou hast circumcised him then shall he eat thereof a foreigner shall not eat thereof in one house shall it be eaten thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh thereof abroad out of the house neither shall ye break a bone thereof
7606803 and there are also many other things which jesus did the which if they could be written every one i suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that should be written
7606804 appears to be scandalized by the title of revelation which i have given to that discovery which god made of himself in the visible works of his creation
7606805 it was this divine law which i referred to in the passage above recited meaning the passage on which they had attacked him being desirous to excite the readers attention to it as it would enable him to judge more freely of the argument i was handling
7606806 i had another view likewise in the same passage and applicable to the same end of giving the reader a more enlarged notion of the question in dispute who by turning his thoughts to reflect on the works of the creator as they are manifested to us in this fabric of the world could not fail to observe that they are all of them great noble and suitable to the majesty of his nature carrying with them the proofs of their origin and showing themselves to be the production of an all wise and almighty being and by accustoming his mind to these sublime reflections he will be prepared to determine whether those miraculous interpositions so confidently affirmed to us by the primitive fathers can reasonably be thought to make a part in the grand scheme of the divine administration or whether it be agreeable that god who created all things by his will and can give what turn to them he pleases by the same will should for the particular purposes of his government and the services of the church descend to the expedient of visions and revelations granted sometimes to boys for the instruction of the elders and sometimes to women to settle the fashion and length of their veils and sometimes to pastors of the church to enjoin them to ordain one man a lecturer another a priest or that he should scatter a profusion of miracles around the stake of a martyr yet all of them vain and insignificant and without any sensible effect either of preserving the life or easing the sufferings of the saint or even of mortifying his persecutors who were always left to enjoy the full triumph of their cruelty and the poor martyr to expire in a miserable death
7606807 that this universal law continues middleton meaning the law revealed in the works of the creation was actually revealed to the heathen world long before the gospel was known we learn from all the principal sages of antiquity who made it the capital subject of their studies and writings
7606808 cicero says middleton has given us a short abstract of it in a fragment still remaining from one of his books on government which says middleton i shall here transcribe in his own words as they will illustrate my sense also in the passages that appear so dark and dangerous to my antagonist
7606809 be one law now and another hereafter but the same eternal immutable law comprehends all nations at all times under one common master and governor of all god
7606810 and if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing i the lord have deceived that prophet
7606811 wherefore i gave them statutes that were not good and judgments by which they should not live
7606812 and he said unto abraham know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and shall serve them and they shall afflict them four hundred years
7606813 the heavens declare the glory of god and the firmament showeth his handiwork day unto day uttereth speech and night unto night showeth knowledge there is no speech nor language where their voice is not heard their line is gone out through all the earth and their words to the end of the world in them hath he set a chamber for the sun which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race his going forth is from the end of the heaven and his circuit unto the ends of it and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof
7606814 he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned
7606815 come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world for i was an hungered and ye gave me meat i was thirsty and ye gave me drink i was a stranger and ye took me in naked and ye clothed me i was sick and ye visited me i was in prison and ye came unto me then shall the righteous answer him saying lord when saw we thee an hungered and fed thee or thirsty and gave thee drink when saw we thee a stranger and took thee in or naked and clothed thee or when saw we thee sick or in prison and came unto thee and the king shall answer and say unto them verily i say unto inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me
7606816 come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world
7606817 depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels

7606879 the newspaper has been redesigned saving memphis publishing co about 6 percent in paper
7606880 the key issue for us is to make sure that the core news coverage continues
7606881 that will mean the need to edit the paper more carefully and also to encourage readers to go online more often when we have additional details that might not fit into the print edition

7606888 the new design will debut on monday july 28th beginning today you will be able to see prototypes displayed on the second floor in the newsroom we should all be proud of the creativity and energy involved in this effort
7606889 in addition to the redesign we also plan to resize the newspaper the planned reductions in newsroom labor and newsprint are a required response to the punishing economics that we face cash flow was down 27 on an 11 decrease in revenues

7606899 lets face it this is a strong republican district and tim mahoneys time here is short lived while floridians are working harder than ever to earn a paycheck mahoney complains that he doesnt like his job
7606900 not only has congressman mahoney been an independent voice who has worked across party lines to produce results for florida but as can be seen by the divisive and dirty republican primary going on right now congressman mahoneys opponents are only offering the kind of ineffective bickering and partisan politics that voters have heard enough of
7606901 reporting quality data on the care provided hospital patients is a key to our continuing effort to provide better value based health care for all americans
7606902 expanding the scope of measures is making hospital compare a more valuable tool for all health care consumers
7606903 cms goal for updating and enhancing the hospital compare web site is to provide usable and accurate information about hospital performance to providers and communities that will encourage hospitals to excel in the quality of care they provide
7606904 with these new enhancements consumers and health care providers will be able to look at individual hospital mortality scores we hope that this new information will cement the web sites role as a key driver in improving the quality and reliability of care in the nations hospitals
7606905 the 30 day medicare mortality data will strengthen quality improvement partnerships in hospitals by encouraging better handoffs and communication

7606911 our goal is to make discoveries that will ultimately allow us to intervene with the most effective early therapy before a mild traumatic brain injury results in a chronic problem
7606912 there is a high prevalence of mild traumatic brain injury in soldiers and the consortiums work is driven by that we believe the conclusions of our research also will benefit civilians including athletes who have suffered concussions
7606913 the award of this grant confirms the collaborative platform of mission connect is a powerful and pivotal force in research
7606914 uniting these premier scientists in this shared research effort will accelerate the pace of discovery and provide the courageous men and women in our military with the best possible medical care for the brain injuries they have sustained
7606915 this grant is a huge boost to research in traumatic brain injury and will allow investigators to work together through mission connect
7606916 for baylor college of medicine it will help fund 10 investigators in neurology neuroscience neurosurgery and pain management and physical rehabilitation
7606917 only through collaboration can we make great strides in restoring function for our young brave men and women in the armed forces
7606918 we in the medical field must serve these men and women by moving the frontiers of treatment faster to provide state of the art interventions now
7606919 an effort led by drs doug dewitt and donald prough of the moody center for brain and spinal cord injury mission connect at utmb is a pivotal component of the department of defense project leading the field with a new blast injury model that simulates the exposure to improvised explosive devices additionally innovative therapies using stem cells anti inflammatory agents growth hormones and the expertise of aggressive rehabilitation at the transitional learning center round out the critical components of utmbs efforts
7606920 oxidative stress is a prominent feature of traumatic brain injury
7606921 we have developed a new antioxidant agent based on carbon nanotubes and in collaboration with dr thomas kent of the baylor college of medicine we will examine the therapeutic potential of the agent to treat mild tbi
7606922 our ability to apply novel intervention strategies to nervous system trauma based on the cellular and molecular biology observations made over the years would suggest that we will be able to make an impact on the treatment modalities to be developed over the next five years
7606923 at utmb the neuroscience research community has a long tradition of excellence dedicated to the understanding of trauma to the nervous system we are very happy to be able to make a contribution to this joint texas effort in what is an exemplary example of translational efforts at utmb
7606924 the institutions that make up mission connect have a long history of working together successfully this significant grant is testament to the fact that our collaboration makes us more competitive for funding than any one of our schools would have been alone and more importantly it strengthens our ability to improve the lives of those affected by traumatic brain injury
7606925 the award is very forward thinking since in addition to clinicians it includes neuroscientists working to elucidate the very basic and fundamental causes of nervous system injury all the way down at the molecular and cellular level
7606926 at present we know very little about how brain injury disrupts the connections and communication among neurons the neuroscientists participating will fill this huge gap in our knowledge armed with this information and working together in a collaborative environment clinicians and neuroscientists stand a much better chance of designing new and innovative treatments for traumatic brain injury
7606927 congratulations to dr valadka and the team for receiving this very prestigious and competitive funding which will improve our knowledge of the complex mechanisms involved in traumatic brain injury the awarding of this grant validates our national stature in the neurosciences and will improve patient care and clinical outcomes for many patients
7606928 a model of innovative thinking and close collaboration between multiple institutions to understand and to advance the care of patients with mild traumatic brain injury
7606929 mild traumatic brain injury is a tremendous problem and there is an outstanding team in place ready to tackle it
7606930 the increasing availability of single serve and multi packs may not serve consumers in the long run but because they are considered to be innocent pleasures may turn out to be sneaky small sins
7606931 maybe the answer lies in consumers taking responsibility for their consumption and monitoring internal cues of sufficiency rather than letting package size take control
7606932 flying under the radar perverse package size effects on consumption self regulation

7606941 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7606942 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7606943 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified

7606948 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7606949 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7606950 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7606951 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7606952 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7606953 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7606954 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7606955 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7606956 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7606957 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7606958 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7606959 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7606960 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7606961 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7606962 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7606963 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be

7606972 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7606973 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7606974 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7606975 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7606976 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7606977 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7606978 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7606979 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7606980 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7606981 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
7606982 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
7606983 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
7606984 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
7606985 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
7606986 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7606987 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7606988 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
7606989 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
7606990 at least i dont cake on the makeup like a trollop you c t

7607000 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7607001 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7607002 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7607003 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7607004 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7607005 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7607006 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7607007 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7607008 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment

7607017 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7607018 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices

7607023 i ask each and every one of you to work as hard for barack and joe biden as you worked for me

7607026 a teacher on the front line as faith and science clash
7607027 a teacher on the front line as faith and science clash
7607028 in a nation where evangelical protestantism and other religious traditions stress a literal reading of the biblical description of gods individually creating each species students often arrive at school fearing that evolution and perhaps science itself is hostile to their faith
7607029 their abiding mistrust in evolution he feared jeopardized their belief in the basic power of science to explain the natural world and their ability to make sense of it themselves
7607030 campbell defended his fellow writers against complaints that they had not included alternative explanations for lifes diversity like intelligent design
7607031 faith is not based on science and science is not based on faith i dont expect you to believe the scientific explanation of evolution that were going to talk about over the next few weeks but i do expect you to understand it
7607032 the question that asked for evidence of evolutionary change had been answered

7607037 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7607038 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
7607039 the fast turnaround and extra attention they paid to my submissions was well worth the money
7607040 i received calls from people interested in my new business within hours of paying for a submission
7607041 everybody knows that celebrities own all the coolest stuff and they own it well before everybody else celebrities travel the world and the minutest details of their daily lives pervade the media as style leaders they are perhaps our most powerful influencers this event respects their power and influence by being an exclusive invite only affair for the caliber of guests we want to insure that their privacy is essential to their full enjoyment of the rohn padmores red carpet gift suite experience and what better place than the gibson beverly hills showroon to stage this type of event for this type of occasion
7607042 the fast turnaround and extra attention they paid to my submissions was well worth the money
7607043 i received calls from people interested in my new business within hours of paying for a submission
7607044 we had a lot of people that called in we are very fortunate that parents were very observant
7607045 to do a proper investigation on organized crime takes a significant number of resources
7607046 we need that investigative capacity and we also need a uniformed gang unit component which is what were building up right now
7607047 what people tend to forget is we have a number of integrated units to target and investigate organized crime and gangs that benefits all communities
7607048 and to those people who have become ill and to the families that have lost loved ones i want to express once again my deepest and most sincere sympathies
7607049 this is not about the lawyers and the accountants its about public health and our consumers and people thats where were spending our time and attention
7607050 the reason we expanded this recall is to act in the best interests of public health and our consumers
7607051 we have no evidence of any further contamination beyond the original two lines under investigation by the regulators but we felt given the new information of yesterday that we had to take the most conservative approach possible and the most conservative approach we could think of was to recall 100 of the production from the entire facility
7607052 we are sanitizing the entire facility in the interest of public safety to ensure that the product we produce in that facility is safe

7607056 it was a big sigh of relief when we did win the race
7607057 we had been close other times this season but this one we get to take home we were the dominant car all night so it felt good to seal the deal
7607058 we ran our new car which we built for the snowball
7607059 we werent going to run it but with some of the problems we have had with our others cars we figured it was time to roll it out all the garc grand american race cars cars we have are great and we knew it wasnt going to be an issue
7607060 its hard to run on the bottom at birmingham we actually made all of our passes down low
7607061 it was a lot of fun to come up through there we practice a little bit on the bottom in case we had to use it during the race when we rolled into victory lane there wasnt a scratch on the car
7607062 i know it takes a real good car i remember one time that the track gave charlie bradberry extra money if he could start from the rear and win the race i watched him come from the back to win it you know i kind of felt like him coming from eight it was definitely in the back of my mind i have a lot of people who are around us and helping us that were racing with charlie so its something you think about
7607063 we knew it was an opportunity where we could come home and run well
7607064 its nice to have a track like birmingham that has so much history we have wanted to put our name on the list of guys who have won there we knew we could go there and race for the win and not have to worry about points or anything we are defiantly ready for lanier
7607065 para nosotros sigue siendo un jugador importante que demuestra su calidad cada vez que ha jugado en pretemporada yo le veo bien estuvo en el corro que formamos cant campeones como el resto y no s lo que pasar pero por el bien de robinho y por el del equipo espero que se solucione su situaci n cuanto antes
7607066 dont you conservatives understand democrats care about the little guy theyre on the side of the proletariat i mean workers and as obama has so eloquently put it if the workers would only stop clinging to their silly sky god and guns theyd understand that
7607067 hey so how is gc doing whats she doing then
7607068 oh shes actually doing great shes got a new job working at abcd and seems to really love it sounds like shes more or less settled in life shes got a decent salary and shes really thrilled about it
7607069 oh well you know companies like abcd they can afford to hire people like gc at that sort of salary because they get all these projects outsourced from the us but its not permanent and youll see abcd will go bust in a few years and gc will be out of a job soon enough
7607070 there are different aspects you enjoy of each role for me from the ownership side of it it is a challenge to put the people together and the day to day challenge of keeping the business going forward in a positive direction is fun for me i enjoy that challenge but the competitive driver is what drives me on a day to day basis to stay enthused about everything that is going on they both have different drives and different aspects of what you want to achieve and the gratification that comes out of them
7607071 this place and michigan are probably the two toughest places on engines the race is 300 miles so it creates a challenge for the engine builders you have to get your car handling good but the power of the car is very important and you have to weigh in the reliability factor when we run our engines on the reliability dyno michigan is where we run it which is very similar to california
7607072 definitely i grew up in bakersfield calif so clearly i remember watching races at riverside and ontario it is always fun to come back to california and race in front of my family and friends
7607073 actually it is largely american and canadian liberals that have implied a moral equivalency between the two

7607076 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7607077 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7607078 traffic was unusually light similar to what we see on a weekend
7607079 monday mornings are usually a pretty heavy day for travel
7607080 since there arent so many people heading in it will be light heading out
7607081 the wild card as always is if there are protests or security related closures
7607082 people will get where they need to go it just might take longer
7607083 what do we care if we were expelled from college scarlett the war is going to start any day now so wed have left college anyhow

7607090 we are not convinced that the government needs to take any action over the near term
7607091 my job as president would be to try to make sure that we are tightening the screws diplomatically on iran that weve mobilized the world community to go after irans program in a serious way to get sanctions in place so that iran starts making a difficult calculation
7607092 weve got to do that before israel feels like its back is to the wall
7607093 im a little free rolling in but good center off
7607094 this is the worst weve been the car is bouncing all over the place on entry
7607095 we had some handling concerns throughout the race the guys made the needed adjustments and we were able to get a solid finish out of it
7607096 it would be almost as important as winning the championship to get a win at indy
7607097 but i really dont approach the race that much different from any others even though youre always aware and know about the prestige of the event just to have your name in the record books would be huge
7607098 more than anything were just looking to get some momentum for the countdown and just cap off the regular season well
7607099 i think weve already got our momentum started it would be nice to go up a leg or two on the competition going into charlotte
7607100 dad has been making great power with the mopar hemi engine we wanted to have the right combination the right ingredients in the car going into these last events before the countdown and we did it weve followed our game plan to the t and hopefully it pays off
7607101 the car felt good from the time we unloaded it we didnt have to make a lot of changes at all with such a great baseline we just fine tuned things during practice and knew we had a solid machine for the race
7607102 alright its been a great race only two more laps so get what you can and take what you can
7607103 the last couple of races he has been up on the wheel and his level of confidence in the greenville toyota toyota is very evident
7607104 this was definitely an up and down day for all of us on the no 22 charmhersocksoff com team
7607105 we were always so close to getting our lap back and something else would happen on the track we stayed in the fight and the crew did an awesome job today we worked through the problems and locked up a solid 11th place finish
7607106 it was a hard race a lot more beating and banging that i am accustomed to i really look forward to racing with esr in the future

7607182 from texas i was at the texas caucus and the obama supporters took the packets as early as 6 30 am which they were told not to do they never let go and then when time came to vote they took over the precinct by some of them pushing the people that were supposed to run it across the room to chairs they called in incorrect totals for obama instead of correct ones he actually had 4 delegates and they called in 19 delegates when my 88 year old mother showed up who can hardly walk on her walker and they took her walker away from her when she said she was there to vote for hillary they said you are in the wrong place old woman this is an obama precinct and you need to go across town when i saw what was happening i called the police blog post no quarter evelyn from texas as an eye witness at the precinct and senate district conventions this is how obama won many caucuses first of all vast numbers of obama supporters were bused in to the conventions they were loud and intimidating texas democratic rules state that each person who participates in the precinct convention should have voted in this precinct and sign in personally on a formal sign in sheet so many obama people showed up that there were not enough sign in sheets available so when the conventions ended there were many sign in sheets for obama filled out in the same handwriting not signed in as specified as hillary supporters we obtained copies of these sign in sheets from all over south texas harris county in particular we laboriously compared the names on the sheets to see if the person who attended the precinct convention had voted in the primary election many listed obama people had not we then cross checked the names of the obama people to see if they lived in the correct precinct many times the obama people did not come to the correct precinct and often appeared on sign in sheets as being present in several precinct conventions at the same time a violation of the space time continuum i walked into the nueses texas county convention only to discover that i was already there as an obama delegate they shoved obama signs in clinton delegates faces three inches from the nose called them racists and told my friend that she had to move from her third row seat in one meeting and go sit in the back she also said that the proceedings were heavily laced with black power speeches by preachers as well as public officials
7607183 concerns about high voter turnout and the inability of the precincts to adequately handle the number of participants and monitor the election process are rampant on the night of the caucus itself the clinton campaign brought many instances of these irregularities to the attention of the state party the campaign received in excess of 2 000 complaints of rules violations indicating widespread violations of the partys rules including the following specific occurrences that are clear violations of specific voter fraud temporary chair packets were released by the election judge prior to 7 00 pm sign in sheets were filled out before 7 00 pm by voters participating in the primary who did not participate in the caucus inaccurate written records of participants presidential preferences precincts were consolidated for purposes of holding a convention precinct caucuses began before polls closed for the primary ineligible participants voted or ineligible delegates were elected including participants who were not registered voters participants who did not vote in the primary and provisional voters whose votes were counted and no verification was made of the eligibility of participants or delegates participants names and presidential preference were entered on sign in sheets by someone other than the eligible individual participants results were taken from a head count or hand count rather than the written roll delegate votes were not ratified by the precinct convention due process failure to follow roberts rules of order at the precinct convention
7607184 the audacity of democracy august 02 2008 ten minute teaser containing footage from puma pac and brad mays new political documentary still being shot around america at this juncture the focus is on malfeasance during the texas primary it should be pointed out that were still loading all the footage weve shot up to now into the editing system and that production will continue through the election and possibly beyond so what we intend to do is change this teaser on a weekly basis sure to generate hot debate

7607198 john mccain is an experienced conservative leader in the tradition of abraham lincoln theodore roosevelt and ronald reagan he is a common sense conservative
7607199 in the tradition of abraham lincoln theodore roosevelt and ronald reagan
7607200 most of you know how i feel about this description please read my last post called common sense nonsense if you missed it however
7607201 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7607202 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7607203 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7607204 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7607205 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7607206 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7607207 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7607208 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7607209 the college football season is an exciting time of year and we thought free food would be a great way to celebrate the inaugural chick fil a college kickoff game and encourage customers to try our new chick n strips
7607210 simply wear your football spirit on your sleeve so to speak and well gladly provide an opportunity to enjoy our new chick n strips for free whether your team wins or loses free chick fil a food is a great proposition for any football fan
7607211 the chick fil a college kickoff is the perfect complement to the chick fil a bowl and hosting these events in our hometown is a natural for chick fil a
7607212 this game will help us generate further awareness of the growing chick fil a brand as well as one of our largest menu additions of the year
7607213 this shouldnt be this hard but i dont know where to go at the moment
7607214 well miss him a lot hes like a brother to us
7607215 i dont want to get into what i was told but the fact is im not here anymore
7607216 the idea of using stamping technique to produce a battery is pretty different
7607217 we can make the batteries really small which lets us put a power source on all sorts of tiny sensors
7607218 the american people do not want government to solve all our problems
7607219 provide immediate relief to working people who have lost their jobs families who have lost their homes and people who have lost their way
7607220 every american is empowered to be a watchdog and a whistle blower
7607221 every senior deserves to live out their life with dignity and respect
7607222 will save the typical family up to 2 500 per year
7607223 develop innovative transitional job programs that place unemployed people into temporary jobs and train them for permanent ones
7607224 we know we cant drill our way to energy independence
7607225 provide every child access to quality affordable early childhood education
7607226 we wont increase taxes on any family earning under 250 000 and we will offer additional tax cuts for middle class families
7607227 by dedicating a portion of the revenues generated by an economy wide cap and trade program
7607228 i strongly support roe v wade thats why i led the fight to defeat bork roberts alito and thomas
7607229 but i dont want my grandsons or granddaughters going back in 15 years so how we leave makes a big difference
7607230 joe and i have been friends for many many years and we know each other very well and so i think obamas made a very wise selection
7607231 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable obviously joe and i have been on different philosophical sides but we have been i consider him a good friend and a good man
7607232 the conference helps employers recognize how laws affect them and their workforce
7607233 tools presented at the event will give employers the information they need to operate a business effectively texas is a great place to do business and we need to do our part at twc to encourage job creation and economic growth in the private sector while helping our employers address the regulatory challenges of employment law
7607234 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7607235 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7607236 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7607237 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7607238 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7607239 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7607240 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7607241 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7607242 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7607243 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7607244 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7607245 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7607246 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7607247 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7607248 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7607249 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7607250 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7607251 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7607252 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7607253 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7607254 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7607255 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7607256 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7607257 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7607258 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7607259 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7607260 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7607261 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7607262 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7607263 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7607264 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7607265 who are open to doing something on the production side
7607266 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7607267 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7607268 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7607269 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7607270 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7607271 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7607272 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7607273 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7607274 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7607275 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7607276 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7607277 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7607278 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7607279 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7607280 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7607281 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7607282 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7607283 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7607284 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7607285 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7607286 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7607287 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7607288 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7607289 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7607290 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7607291 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

7607296 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7607297 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations

7607300 in the beginning of any media format a lot of content is oriented toward men
7607301 as more content is created for the female market women become dominant and drive most of the ad dollars
7607302 we think of segments of individuals who share certain attitudes and needs
7607303 women will often follow because they want to keep a family plan

7607307 il principio lo stesso aggiunge il ministro zaia negli ultimi mesi il latte aumentato dell11 8 ecco in questo modo si pu arrivare a vendere un litro di latte a 70 80 centesimi invece che a 1 20 1 30 euro

7607310 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7607311 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7607312 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7607313 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7607314 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7607315 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7607316 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7607317 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7607318 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7607319 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

7607336 if that strategy made sense and would lead ultimately to the pullout of u s troops but in the short term required additional troop strength to protect those who are already on the ground then thats something i would support

7607344 many others have been injured and we expect casualties to rise

7607346 zardari thanked pakistan peoples party of which he is the co chairman and said he will announce his decision within the next 24 hours
7607347 presidency is the right of our party and that is why party lawmakers asked zardari to run for this post
7607348 the militants had established their command and control system in the thickly populated areas with an intention to use the civilian population as human shield we are leaving no stone unturned to avoid the civilian casualties in the operation and advance it in a systematic manner we have inflicted considerable damage on their command and control system and according to our information 45 50 hardcore militants including a leading commander have been killed
7607349 we enjoy the support of the people but i still urge them to pick up arms against the militants and dont allow them to hide among them
7607350 these displaced people are in urgent need of basic necessities such as food clean water and shelter
7607351 lack of medical care is a problem for sick people particularly children
7607352 we have credible information about the killing of 10 15 foreign militants out of the 45 killed on saturday
7607353 we have not found the bodies of the foreign militants but intercepts provided us sufficient evidence that they were foreign militants
7607354 we have been forced to take this decision which we take with great regret
7607355 zardari pledged in writing to reinstate the judges within one day of musharraf leaving

7607404 ha grandi qualit e non gli manca nulla per diventare un grande numero 10 e questanno vedrete che lippi lo chiamer in nazionale daltronde giovinco bravo e i giovani bravi devono giocare paragoni mi ricorda pi baggio ma ha anche alcuni colpi di alex in realt giovinco giovinco pensi che mio figlio gi mi chiede di lui
7607405 la formica atomica rende al massimo da seconda punta o trequartista dietro a una o due punte poi per talmente giovane e bravo che pu sacrificarsi anche a centrocampo del piero o baggio dico roby e zola ma lasciamolo crescere con calma senza troppe responsabilit in questo momento deve giocare come sa senza alcun peso
7607406 s giovinco lo vedo pi rifinitore come roby piuttosto che punta vera e propria alla del piero su dove arriver non mi sbilancio giovane e ha bisogno di maturare
7607407 siamo di fronte ad un giocatore di grandi qualit ma molto atipico
7607408 ha un bel tiro ed molto rapido non deve stare troppo lontano dalla porta
7607409 non ha ancora raggiunto il pieno della maturit pu migliorare ancora molto lo conosciamo lanno scorso a empoli fece benissimo e le sensazioni per il futuro sono pi che positive
7607410 lho sempre visto giocare sulla fascia credo sia lunica posizione nella quale impiegarlo e un giocatore molto rapido che fa della velocit la sua caratteristica migliore chi mi ricorda e difficile trovare un paragone assomiglia ad una vecchia ala di una volta un dribblomane fuori dal coro dei giocatori ormai solo fisici
7607411 e gi un grande e ha tutte le doti per fare bene ha la capacit di trovare gli spazi anche quando non ci sono lideale negli ultimi 30 metri quando si incontrano le squadre tutte chiuse in difesa poi un giocatore poliedrico si pu impiegare sia dietro le punte che sulla fascia sinistra come vice nedved pu adattarsi anche in questo ruolo di ala senza nessun problema nonostante il suo fisico minuto e proprio per questo non saprei trovare un altro giocatore che me lo ricorda
7607412 le doti ci sono tutte bisogna dargli fiducia guardiamo come si comportano le squadre europee con i vari messi ag ero e tutti i giovani dellarsenal
7607413 la juve questanno ha inserito in squadra una serie di giovani tutti molto validi per il presente e in prospettiva futura giovinco poi quello che insieme a de ceglie ha gi maturato pi esperienza in serie a il giocatore quindi c e sono sicuro che ranieri sapr gestirlo al meglio i giovani meritano fiducia fin da subito
7607414 deve essere anche il ragazzo ad indirizzare il tecnico spiegando dove pu dare il massimo con le grandi qualit che ha a disposizione laltezza non sar assolutamente un problema anzi le squadre migliori devono avere giocatori con caratteristiche diverse che sappiano integrarsi al meglio poi il suo vantaggio quello di possedere due argomenti fondamentali per il gioco del calcio la qualit e la velocit in questo senso abbastanza unico e non riuscirei a trovare un giocatore simile a lui

7607428 first class facilities first class organization that is what is being said about the games in beijing
7607429 but it was also noticeable that china did not do as well when it comes to human rights press freedom and democratization
7607430 the carefully orchestrated facade could not conceal a police state that tramples on human rights

7607452 our work uncovers an achilles heel of influenza a viruses that cause human epidemics and high mortality pandemics
7607453 we have identified the structure of a key target site for drugs that could be developed to effectively combat this disease
7607454 the x ray crystal structure gives us unique insights into how the ns1 and human protein bind at the atomic level and how that suppresses a crucial antiviral response
7607455 these experiments validate the ns1 pocket as a target for antiviral drug discovery
7607456 because this ns1 pocket is highly conserved in all influenza a viruses isolated from humans a drug targeted to the pocket would be effective against all human influenza a strains including the bird flu

7607487 we know kumar is a good enough player at any position but well probably have to do a rethink
7607488 we know they had only four bowlers but when you lose four wickets up front theres nothing much you can do we failed to make use of that slot where their fifth bowler would have come in
7607489 and he has before so thats the way it goes
7607490 obviously this is not the way you want it to happen but its an opportunity for a lot of guys and i am one of the guys who has to step up and take advantage of it

7607504 blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness for they will be filled
7607505 they are before the throne of god and serve him day and night in his temple and he who sits on the throne will spread his tent over them never again will they hunger never again will they thirst the sun will not beat upon them nor any scorching heat for the lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd he will lead them to springs of living water and god will wipe away every tear form their eyes
7607506 the central role of bees in the environment and farm economy should be emphasized in environmental regulation and enforcement including in the review and approval of new farm chemicals and treatments in the farm bill or otherwise congress should among other things mandate that sub lethal effects on honey bees be considered in the regulatory process for new agricultural treatments
7607507 organic farming practices that retain more natural habitats and avoid the use of chemical pesticides should provide environments that serve as honeybee sanctuaries from the ravages of ccd there are scientific studies showing that agricultural landscapes with organic crops are far superior environments for both honey and bumblebees it would be prudent to create organic bee sanctuaries as widely and as soon as possible there is every reason to eliminate the use of all pesticides that act synergistically with parasitic fungi and all crops should be banned for the same reason obviously these problems will disappear with the widespread adoption of organic non gm farming

7607526 i pray also that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which he has called you the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints and his incomparably great power for us who believe
7607527 who has saved us and called us to a holy life not because of anything we have done but because of his own purpose and grace

7607532 and may the god of peace himself sanctify you through and through separate you from profane things make you pure and wholly consecrated to god and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved sound and complete and found blameless at the coming of our lord jesus christ the messiah
7607533 for the time being no discipline brings joy but seems grievous and painful but afterwards it yields a peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it a harvest of fruit which consists of righteousness in conformity to gods will in purpose thought and action resulting in right living and right standing with god so then brace up and reinvigorate and set right your slackened and weakened and drooping hands and strengthen your feeble and palsied and tottering knees and cut through and make firm and plain and smooth straight paths for your feet yes make them safe and upright and happy paths that go in the right direction so that the lame and halting limbs may not be put out of joint but rather be cured
7607534 and let the wife see that she respects and reverences her husband that she notices him regards him honors him prefers him venerates and esteems him and that she defers to him praises him and loves and admires him exceedingly

7607536 every good gift and every perfect free large full gift is from above it comes down from the father of all that gives light in the shining of whom there can be no variation rising or setting or shadow cast by his turning as in an eclipse
7607537 some seed fell into good soil and grew up and yielded a crop a hundred times as great
7607538 therefore we do not lose heart though outwardly we are wasting away yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day for our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that outweighs them all so we fix our eyes not on what is seen but what is unseen for what is seen is temporary but what is unseen is eternal
7607539 all of a sudden my trial sent by god becomes a trail to god
7607540 for the eyes of the lord range throughout the earth to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to him
7607541 im going to make him an offer he cant refuse
7607542 for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life in christ jesus our lord
7607543 his divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness
7607544 then you will know the truth and the truth will set you free
7607545 therefore if anyone is in christ he is a new creation the old is gone the new has come
7607546 fasten your seatbelts its going to be a bumpy night
7607547 god is our refuge and strength an ever present help in trouble therefore we will not fear though the earth give way and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea
7607548 as for god his way is perfect the word of the lord is flawless
7607549 you are the light of the world a city on a hill cannot be hidden neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl instead they put it on a stand and it gives light to everyone in the house
7607550 ill get you my pretty and your little dog too
7607551 your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour
7607552 in my fathers house are many rooms if it were not so i would have told you i am going to prepare a place for you
7607553 behold i am coming soon my reward is with me and i will give everyone according to what he has done i am the alpha and the omega the first and the last the beginning and the end
7607554 i have fought the good fight i have finished the race i have kept the faith
7607555 now to the king eternal invisible the only god be honor and glory for ever and ever amen
7607556 let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess for he who promised is faithful
7607557 this was so that by two unchangeable things his promise and his oath in which it is impossible for god ever to prove false or deceive us we who have fled to him for refuge might have mighty indwelling strength and strong encouragement to grasp and hold fast the hope appointed us and set before us now we have this hope as a sure and secure anchor of the soul it cannot slip and cannot break down under whoever steps out upon it a hope that reaches farther and enters into the very certainty of the presence within the veil
7607558 there is something more than just the reduction in driving that has to be brought in as an explanation for the huge drop in fatalities
7607559 its really very interesting that with all these efforts that have gone into building safer highways safer cars better enforcement this really dramatic change were seeing is due to economics to the price of gasoline
7607560 this is really the first time since the 1970s that people are thinking about driving and about what is the cost of an individual trip
7607561 hands up those of you who know what this means kann sie
7607562 h is hesitation was about moral choices he wasnt yet willing to make
7607563 thats how you explain the third reich and stalin and pol pot but its also how you explain the frequent waywardness of human beings on a less severe scale the rancorous marriage the estranged sibling the gambling addiction
7607564 i dont know if i can believe in god when i see all the suffering in the world
7607565 we are no better off facing hurricanes or terrorism or disease alone than facing them knowing that a good and compassionate god is right there with us
7607566 i think there must be many paths to god so i dont know whether i can commit to one way
7607567 we human beings are by nature spiritual bushwackers that is why there are so many different religions in the world all attempting to define a pathway to god
7607568 if god wants me to believe he should show himself
7607569 if there is a god he should show himself in a way that i cannot deny
7607570 o ne was mostly black with a little white and the other was mostly white with a little black cash had named one sin and the other redemption cash explained that he kept the dogs as a reminder that none of us is completely good or completely bad

7607580 were getting excited over a statue of a character from a mediocre sitcom that went off the air 25 years ago
7607581 were happy if hollywood so much as bases a sitcom in our city even if its not filmed there if you do that and if the sitcom if even moderately successful we will honor you the show the actors forever
7607582 we need to get this matter resolved before the transfer deadline

7607585 i need to keep working at le mans and arsenal will open the door for me
7607586 i have dreamed about that club to play for arsenal will be the best day of my life and i will do anything to play for that team
7607587 it is their game the freedom the manager gives them to express their qualities
7607588 they are all young players and out of all the top european clubs they are the only ones who work like this i really love that
7607589 do not fret because of evil men or be envious envy is the verb of those who do wrong for they are like the grass they will soon wither like the green plants they will soon die away
7607590 delight yourself in the lord and he will give you the desires of your heart
7607591 commit your ways to the lord trust in him and he will do this he will make your righteousness shine like the dawn the justice of your cause like the noonday sun
7607592 be still before the lord and wait patiently for him do not fret when men succeed in their ways when they carry out their wicked schemes
7607593 the funny thing is the bed hadnt changed at all its just as sturdy just as comfortable it can hold my weight soothe my soreness what has changed is my experience i now harbor a suspicion that dread things lurk beneath and so i approach the bed with a guardedness that i wont let drop i rest where i can trust i rest on the bed that im assured wont buckle beneath my weight in the room where im confident i wont be left vulnerable to enemies and predators if i lack trust i may sleep in the house or the room or the bed but i wont really rest there ill do it out of sheer exhaustion maybe but not out of trust ill be fitful and anxious always checking my back tense and clenching a hair trigger on my reflexes my point how i think about the bed determines whether or not i rest in it
7607594 and he will give you the desires of your heart
7607595 he will make your righteousness shine like the dawn the justice of your cause like the noonday sun
7607596 but those that hope in the lord will inherit the land
7607597 but the meek will inherit the land and enjoy great peace
7607598 the days of the blameless are known to the lord and their inheritance will endure forever
7607599 if the lord delights in a mans way he makes his steps firm though he stumble he will not fall for the lord upholds him with his hand
7607600 for the lord loves the just and will not forsake his faithful ones
7607601 the salvation of the righteous comes from the lord he is a stronghold in time of trouble the lord helps them and delivers them the delivers them from the wicked and saves them because they take refuge in him
7607602 for god hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind
7607603 bill those the best potato chips i have ever tasted
7607604 the warm soothing sun the aroma of freshly brewed coffee a spirited game with old friends punto the coffee house game from italy
7607605 hope affects the christian life by making us expectant and alive people with minimal hope live in drudgery and boredom because they think they know whats going to happen next theyve made their assessment of god the people around them and themselves and they know whats coming people who hope never know whats coming next they expect it is going to be good because god is good even when disasters occur people of hope look for how god will use evil for good a person with hope is alive to god hope is powerful it is stimulating it keeps us on tiptoe looking for the unexpected
7607606 but godliness with contentment is great gain for we brought nothing into this world and we can take nothing out of it
7607607 this statement is the key to spiritual growth and personal fulfillment we should honor god and center our desires on him godliness and should be content with what god is doing in our lives
7607608 lord you have assigned me my portion and my cup
7607609 i just couldnt pass awarding helen with the mathetes award
7607610 this is a diamond needle in the haystack of blogland
7607611 and we know that in all things god works for the good of those who love him who have been called according to his purpose
7607612 for those god foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brothers and those he predestined he also called those he called he also justified those he justified he also glorified
7607613 what then shall we say in response to this if god is for us who can be against us he who did not spare his own son but gave him up for us all how will he not also along with him graciously give us all things
7607614 in the same way the spirit helps us in our weakness we do not know what we ought to pray for but the spirit himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express and he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the spirit because the spirit intercedes for the saints in accordance with gods will
7607615 who shall separate us from the love of christ shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword as it is written
7607616 for your sake we face death all day long we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered
7607617 create in me a pure heart o god and renew a steadfast spirit within me
7607618 you were wearied by all your ways but you would not say it is hopeless you found renewal of your strength and so you did not faint
7607619 do not be conformed any longer to the pattern of this world but be transformed by the renewal of your mind then you will be able to test and approve what gods will is his good pleasing and perfect will
7607620 therefore we do not lose heart though outwardly we are wasting away yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day
7607621 he restores my soul he guides me in paths of righteousness for his names sake
7607622 restore us to yourself o lord that we may return renew our days as of old
7607623 test me o lord and try me examine my heart and my mind
7607624 you will keep in perfect peace him whose mind is steadfast because he trusts in you
7607625 then he opened their minds so they could understand the scriptures
7607626 i appeal to you brothers in the name of our lord jesus christ that all of you agree with one another so that there may be no divisions among you and that you may be perfectly united in mind and thought
7607627 you were taught with regard to your former way of life to put off your old self which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires to be made new in attitude of your minds and to put on the new self created to be like god in true righteousness and holiness
7607628 set your mind on things above not on earthly things
7607629 for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways
7607630 for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty in god for pulling down of strongholds casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of god bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of christ
7607631 do not touch and do not even think about it
7607632 prior to joining the world bank mr malloch brown was the lead international partner from 1986 1994 in a strategic communications management firm where he worked with corporations governments and political candidates he also provided strategic advice to governments on managing change and on public policy issues including privatization environment human rights and other matters mr malloch brown also advised ceos on corporate marketing and change management issues mr malloch brown is a board member of the open society institute george soros foundation network
7607633 during the late 1980s malloch brown was on the payroll of washingtons sawyer miller political consultancy group
7607634 the main mission is to educate the american media about colombia get good coverage and nurture contacts with journalists columnists and think tanks the message is that there are bad and good people in colombia and that the government is the good guy
7607635 their appointment was made when the colombian government was at its lowest standing with the american people
7607636 the main role of the group who had signed up former reagan administration ed rollins and pr star john scanlon on as partners was to pressure journalists into spinning for the government
7607637 sawyer miller did not want to give the perception that the colombian government and the u s had differences
7607638 producers even claimed that sawyer miller tried to change the content of the programme
7607639 sawyer miller also attempted to pressurise editors who were unsympathetic to colombias ties with drug barons sawyer miller reuqested a meeting with the editor of the miami herald when it described the colombian government as a weakling according to the editor
7607640 they were sharp and even followed up the meeting with a couple of phone calls yes we did tone down our criticisms but it was mainly because the president explained that he was following public opinion in colombia
7607641 sawyer miller has also played a key role in skewing the war on terror in colombia
7607642 colombias links to narcotics and right wing paramilitaries are well documented click on the colombia label below sawyer millers role was to cover this up and present colombia as a country free from corruption sawyer miller helped to convince the american public that colombia wasnt the corrupt country that they had been led to believe and that there were no such links to narcotics the recent revelations over uribes administration have given lie to that and yet such was the effectiveness of this pr campaign uribe maintains a level of popularity far in excess of most corrupt administrations the fact that malloch brown played such a key role in producing propaganda for the colombian government much to the delight of washington truly gives lie to the claim that gordon brown has shifted the government to a more humane position in global politics there are still those at the heart of government that are eager to do the bidding of the united states around the world melanie phillips can sleep easy
7607643 no or i wouldnt be talking to right now lets play some beer pong
7607644 there hasnt been any discussion that i have been involved in there
7607645 we are going to explore every option that is available and the last time that i talked with michael he had accepted his new challenge and was very happy about that and i have not spoken with him at all since the other nights game
7607646 5 cover allows a talented filmmaker like craig to use technologies that change the way audiences consume and engage in content
7607647 rather than using all the new screens as simply additional distribution platforms we are building an entirely new interactive experience that makes connections between the audience and content more meaningful
7607648 content is now a click away and distribution platforms can fit in the palm of your hand
7607649 for me its always been memphis music and musicians and now people from around the world at any time of the day on a multitude of devices will be able to click and snack in my own backyard with some of the coolest cats this side of the mississippi river
7607650 es war einmal ein vater der rief weil alt geworden seine s hne und t chter zusammen vier f nf sechs acht an der zahl bis sie sich nach l ngerem z gern seinem wunsch f gten um einen tisch sitzen sie nun und beginnen sogleich zu plaudern jeder f r sich alle durcheinander zwar ausgedacht vom vater und nach seinen worten doch eigensinnig und ohne ihn bei aller liebe schonen zu wollen
7607651 ist nun mal so mit unserem v terchen lebt rein vergangenheitsm ig immer noch kommt davon nicht los
7607652 die zwiebel hat viele h ute gehackt treibt sie tr nen erst beim h uten spricht sie wahr was vor und nach dem ende meiner kindheit geschah klopft mit tatsachen an will mal so mal so erz hlt werden und verf hrt zu l gengeschichten
7607653 in ihm h lt sich alles was er im weichen noch fl ssigen zustand zu fassen bekam er widerlegt ausfl chte
7607654 und dann soll auch noch alles unter papas regie laufen er denkt sich uns einfach aus ruft nana und mir legt er w rter in den mund die absolut nicht meine sind beklagt sich taddel
7607655 wo jetzt der leere parkplatz und die dichter sollen sich aus ihren b chern vorgelesen haben
7607656 f r unseren vatti z hlt nur was sich erz hlen l sst klagt taddel
7607657 haben wir damals nicht mitgekriegt ehrlich nana ich mein die geschichte zwischen unserem vater und deiner mutter

7607660 prometo que no descansaremos hasta que logremos la liberaci n de todos los presos
7607661 a pesar de la gran felicidad sabemos que tambi n hay pesar por quienes han quedado atr s los 11 000 que a n deber n ser liberados
7607662 todos ellos tienen un lugar en nuestro coraz n pero hay uno especial para nuestro hermano mayor marwan barghuti y para nuestro hermano l der ahmad saadat a quienes esperamos ver pronto
7607663 no hay duda de que buscamos la paz y de que intentamos lograr nuestros objetivos y no habr paz sin la liberaci n de todos los presos
7607664 no es f cil para israel liberar prisioneros algunos de los individuos que han sido puestos en libertad hoy han sido declarados culpables por su implicaci n directa en el asesinato de civiles inocentes
7607665 sin embargo entendemos la importancia de la cuesti n de los prisioneros para la sociedad palestina creemos que esta acci n puede ayudar a las negociaciones y generar buena voluntad
7607666 sta es una victoria sobre la prisi n una victoria sobre las esposas una victoria de la libertad esta es la primera victoria
7607667 en esta liberaci n confluyen dos elementos novedosos en primer lugar no se da nada a cambio de los presos y en segundo hay una desviaci n de los criterios establecidos para las liberaciones que determinan que ning n preso ser liberado antes de cumplir dos tercios de su condena y que ning n preso que haya matado a israel es podr beneficiarse de estas liberaciones
7607668 es extremadamente importante seguir haciendo avances y no tanto llegar de forma prematura a una serie de conclusiones
7607669 being arctic monkeys the polar opposite would be desert monkeys so theyre gonna come out and just experience that and their idea is to submerge themselves in something else and do some tracks
7607670 thats the sort of pressure free lets do something cool environment that really pays musical dividends at the end yknow theyre a talented bunch of guys its gonna be a lot of fun
7607671 being in a band is about betting on yourself and believing in yourself and chasing your passion for music
7607672 and i dont think they have any problem doing that
7607673 were gonna do some tracks and im really looking forward to it cos i like them a lot
7607674 three years later we still have concerned citizens and ngos struggling for transparency in the process of the proposed developments at ta en it is a pity that the government and the gozo ministry still seem to be unaware of the ecological ornithological and geomorphologic uniqueness of ta en
7607675 it is absolutely unacceptable that the ta en site home to various birds endemic species and historical remains has not been included in the list of protected sites
7607676 you all look like you could be those peoples children

7607679 oh they have things to eat what kinds of things
7607680 you ought to teach creation as well as the fact of evolution
7607681 all of those kinds of sciences have holes in them but im not about teaching religion in schools
7607682 creo que el seleccionador quiere contar con el mismo equipo que actu en atenas hace cuatro a os

7607689 well 23 years of being on the verge is just about enough a dinner with mac users thanks dice and jon finally pushed me over the edge and so i went out and finally made the commitment and bought a 15
7607690 a theatre goddess who is naomi clarks best friend and ethan wards secret girlfriend she suffers a serious drug addiction
7607691 maybe just the fringe is fake but maybe its real and just ridiculously healthy but maybe not also shes wearing a ton of makeup she kinda reminds me of annie potts in pretty in pink with the heavy eyeliner and the dramatic wigs and are those wedding shoes
7607692 we could because of quality take a lot more students if the resources would allow us
7607693 they always tried for a fourth judge because it followed the format of the original show pop idol
7607694 we havent had much luck with that working but were gonna give it another try
7607695 they are in love and this news makes things even better
7607696 britney spears will not be performing at the vmas this year im telling you officially and unequivocally

7607700 if we cant be safe walking home in a place like kutztown then theres no place one can feel safe
7607701 what he did to kyle was cold blooded and cruel
7607702 please know that ive thought of your son every day and will every day of my life
7607703 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here that they were elected to represent
7607704 that however they decide to vote we will all be united behind senator obama
7607705 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7607706 it would have been the same way if i had won and barack was here supporting the unity of the party
7607707 this was a hard fought campaign and there was a lot of intensity and passion associated with it in part because of the historic nature of our two candidacies
7607708 even before the convention and even before the complete reconciliation that we need
7607709 transgender bias suit against library of congress could change federal policy
7607710 this case the way its going would seem to establish that transgender people are protected
7607711 look at these mom awww theyre so cute they want to go home with us right now today look look
7607712 theyre adorable but no no no no dont you kids dare fall in love because these arent the puppies that were supposed to get today just walk away quickly before we end up taking twenty puppies home
7607713 we might guess its breed and we might know the dogs name knowing that rufus is george clooneys dog gives us a lot more rufusy context
7607714 ik ben echt opgelucht dat alles opgelost is ik wil ook de fans van chelsea bedanken voor hun steun maar ik ben blij dat ik terug in milaan ben
7607715 i have to confess i didnt go into it quite as relaxed and comfortable as i usually would
7607716 i felt a little bit of extra pressure and i dont know why its silly because brad is such a relaxed collaborative fellow and his scripts are absolutely wonderful this one of course drew an awful lot of attention because it was such a great script and there is so much for all the actors especially david hewlett
7607717 the audiences help to drive trends its a very vibrant very fertile area and i dont think anyones monopolized it
7607718 this partnership is an important step to supplement some of the green practices we already have in place
7607719 the collection of plastic and aluminum bottles at rangers ballpark in is one of many initiatives underway in our efforts to be more environmentally friendly working with an industry leader like abitibi bowater is a tremendous benefit for the rangers and our fans
7607720 or something similar next to it should i call email or come by the hotel cafe to get tickets for a show that is 3 weeks away sold out next to it does that mean i shoud email or come by to ask how to buy tickets
7607721 communism provides services to the people such as a job a place to live and universal health care
7607722 communism is not what makes china bad it is corporate fascism
7607723 the goal is not to reduce the price of oil but to eliminate it from society
7607724 wouldnt it be great if hillary clinton was nominated for president and we got rid of that little putz
7607725 the average daily production of iraqi crude oil was 2 5 million barrels including 1 million for export uses and half a million for local consumption
7607726 if oil prices maintained their current levels iraqi revenues will exceed 100 billion
7607727 but connors did beat borg in the 76 and 78 uso final
7607728 major general nanda mallawaarachchi ccmp major mahesh kumar general sivali warnasekara general sunil thennakoon general soyza presidents security coordinator brigadier jagath alwis and ousted officials such as captain athula rajapakse and captain madhawa madawala
7607729 these senior officers are highly disciplined soldiers and i am sure that their expert advice would have gone a long way in maintaining law and order in the two provinces in order to ensure a conducive peaceful atmosphere for the provincial council elections
7607730 instead of levelling allegations against them people should express appreciation for their role
7607731 championing the cause of the tamils they even drove every muslim out of the northern province the muslims merely because they are muslims had to leave behind all their possession and the land where they lived peacefully with the tamils for several generations they are now languishing in refugee camps for more than 17 years in the south with the sinhalese in puttalam and anuradhapura districts without privacy and their basic needs met
7607732 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time
7607733 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow celebrities refuse to consider any attack off limits
7607734 im shocked by the video when i look at amy i think for christs sake just get a grip of yourself enough is enough as the police know amy is a drug addict and she has now been caught twice on film taking illegal drugs they should arrest her and put her behind bars rehab clinics are a waste of money
7607735 we are turning the heat up on idol this year and are thrilled to welcome kara to the judges table
7607736 we found that the actions of andy dick were more in line with an assault than a sexual battery it didnt appear to be an overt sexual act
7607737 wanneer we ons echter baseren op de ondertekende compromissen op dit ogenblik stellen we vast dat de marktprijzen eerder stagneren
7607738 de stijging spreekt zeker de mening van vastgoedanalisten tegen die het eerder hebben over een daling van de vastgoedprijzen hun conclusie wordt bevestigd wanneer we de cijfers van het 1ste semester van 2008 vergelijken met de gegevens van het 2de semester van 2007 hieruit blijkt dat de vastgoedprijzen op dit ogenblik minder snel stijgen dan de inflatie geschat op 4 8 procent tot 5 procent voor 2008 hetgeen dus zelfs neerkomt op een lichte daling van de vastgoedprijzen in re le termen
7607739 de vastgoedprijzen in vlaanderen zullen niet spectaculair stijgen of dalen eerder stabiliseren voor een openspatten van de vastgoedbel zoals bijvoorbeeld in de verenigde staten hoeven we zeker niet te vrezen
7607740 we lose about 35 000 a year in materials that are checked out and not returned
7607741 those overdue fees and fines they do add up so at our library with the size of our community in
7607742 the question would be how many times before it gets put on your credit report
7607743 we are extremely encouraged by the results of the aza 001 trial which for the first time showed that survival could be extended for patients with higher risk mds
7607744 roughly 30 percent of patients diagnosed with mds will progress to acute myeloid leukemia aml but treatment with vidaza significantly delays this progression vidaza not only has great survival data in mds but can also prevent progression to aml

7607976 the game requests the player to be a hero and save black balloons by performing a number of energy saving actions such as switching off lights and appliances before the snowman melts because of the effects of climate change
7607977 we have designed this game to appeal to late primary school and early secondary school students but i think lots of adults may also enjoy playing it
7607978 the game really gives kids the understanding and empowers them by letting them know that their individual actions can reduce their impact on climate change
7607979 the game is really engaging kids think it looks cool and best of all it helps them develop a connection between the causes and effects of climate change while having fun playing the game
7607980 antioxidants sit within this tiny trojan horse protecting it from attack from digestive juices in the stomach
7607981 once in the small intestine the nanoparticle gets sticky and bonds to the intestinal wall it then leaks its contents directly into the intestinal cells which allows them to be absorbed directly into the blood stream
7607982 we hope that by mastering this technique drugs and supplements also vulnerable to the digestive process can be better absorbed by the human body

7608016 if then you have been raised with christ to a new life thus sharing his resurrection from the dead aim at and seek the rich eternal treasures that are above where christ is seated at the right hand of god and set your minds and keep them set on what is above the higher things not on the things that are on the earth for as far as this world is concerned you have died and your new real life is hidden with christ in god when christ who is our life appears then you also will appear with him in the splendor of his glory
7608017 may god himself the god of peace sanctify you through and through may your whole soul spirit and body be kept blameless at the coming of our lord jesus christ the one who calls you is faithful and he will do it

7608020 be holy because i the lord your god am holy
7608021 sacrifice and offering you did not desire but a body prepared for me
7608022 we act and live in confidence that someday we will see face to face that we will live into the answers
7608023 i feel like you are this huge volume bigger and more vast than i have ever seen or beheld the pages are endless to even try to hold you in my hands would be fruitless my lap would not be able to contain you how could i withstand your weight
7608024 o god you are my god earnestly i seek you my soul thirsts for you in a dry and weary land where there is no water i have seen you in the sanctuary and beheld your power and your glory because your love is better than life my lips will glorify you i will praise you as long as i live and in your name i will lift up my hands my soul will be satisfied as with the richest of foods with singing lips my mouth will praise you
7608025 dont you think it is time for both of us
7608026 forget the former things do not dwell on the past see i am doing a new thing now it springs up do you not perceive it i am making a way in the desert and streams in the wasteland
7608027 surely he will never be shaken a righteous man will be remembered forever he will have no fear of bad news his heart is steadfast trusting in the lord his heart is secure he will have no fear in the end he will look in triumph on all his foes
7608028 may god himself the god of peace sanctify you through and through may your whole spirit soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our lord jesus christ the one who calls is faithful and he will do it
7608029 may the god of your hope so fill you with all joy and peace in believing through the experience of your faith that by the power of the holy spirit you may abound and be overflowing bubbling over with hope
7608030 god will let you laugh again youll raise the roof with shouts of joy
7608031 in this you greatly rejoice though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials these have come so that your faith of greater worth than gold which perishes even though refined by fire may be proved genuine and may result in praise glory and honor when jesus christ is revealed though you have not seen him you love him and even though you do not see him now you believe in him and are filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy for you are receiving the goal of your faith the salvation of your souls
7608032 surely he will never be shaken a righteous man will be remembered forever he will have no fear of bad news his heart is steadfast trusting in the lord his heart is secure he will have no fear in the end he will look in triumph on his foes
7608033 jesus did many other things as well if every one of them were written down i suppose that even the whole world would not have enough room for the books that would be written
7608034 when the people saw that moses was so long in coming down from the mountain they gathered around aaron and said
7608035 the lord bless you and keep you the lord make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you the lord turn his face toward you and give you peace
7608036 we are setting out for the place about which the lord said i will give it to you come with us and we will treat you well for the lord has promised good things to israel
7608037 as the ark and the people set out moses said
7608038 rise up o lord may your enemies be scattered may your foes flee before you
7608039 send some men to explore the land of canaan which i am giving to the israelites
7608040 we cant take this land its too hard and the people are too big just look at the fruit
7608041 we should go up and take possession of the land for we can certainly do it
7608042 the land we passed through and explored is exceedingly good if the lord is pleased with us he will lead us into that land a land flowing with milk and honey and will give it to us only do not rebel against the lord and do not be afraid of the people of the land because we will swallow them up their protection is gone but the lord is with us do not be afraid of them
7608043 separate yourselves from this assembly so i can put an end to them at once
7608044 o god god of the spirits of all mankind will you be angry with the entire assembly when only one man sins
7608045 get away from the assembly so i can put an end to them at once
7608046 because you did not trust in me enough to honor me as holy in the sight of the israelites you will not bring this community into the land i give them
7608047 go up this mountain in the abarim range and see the land i have given the israelites
7608048 my dear brothers take note of this everyone should be quick to listen slow to speak and slow to become angry for mans anger does not bring about the righteous life that god desires
7608049 pharaohs heart is unyielding he refuses to let my people go
7608050 let my people go so that they may worship me in the desert
7608051 and all the egyptians dug along the nile to get drinking water because they could not drink the water of the river
7608052 but when pharaoh saw that there was relief he hardened his heart and would not listen to moses and aaron
7608053 neither the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night left its place in front of the people
7608054 do not be afraid stand firm and you will see the deliverance the lord will bring today the egyptians you see today you will never see again the lord will fight for you you need only to be still
7608055 they looked toward the desert and there was the glory of the lord appearing in the cloud
7608056 some gathered much and some little he who gathered much did not have too much and he who gathered little did not have too little each one gathered as much as he needed
7608057 when moses hands grew tired they took a stone and put it under him and he sat on it aaron and hur held his hands up one on one side one on the other so that his hands remained steady till sunset
7608058 now i know that the lord is greater than all other gods
7608059 moses listened to his father in law and did everything he said
7608060 see i am sending an angel ahead of you to guard you along the way and to bring you to the place i have prepared since my name is in him
7608061 but moses alone is to approach the lord the others must not come near
7608062 then have them make a sanctuary for me and i will dwell among them
7608063 make this tabernacle and all its furnishings exactly like the pattern i will show you
7608064 what is my response when i see my own consequences subsiding do my convictions let up as well
7608065 knew she was getting let outside on a regular basis
7608066 we cant keep her shes still peeing on the floor
7608067 i consider the time spent writing in my journal as sabbath time a time of rest and solitude a time to come apart to be with god and to reflect on his word to search for his will and to record the insights i receive my journal has been the channel of many blessings
7608068 your first mission here on earth is to seek out and find in daily even hourly communication the one from whom your mission is derived your second mission is to do what you can moment by moment day by day step by step to make this world a better place following the lead and guidance of gods spirit within you and around you your third mission is one which is uniquely yours and that is to exercise the talent that you particularily came to earth to use your greatest gift that which you most delight to use in the places and settings god has caused to appeal to you most and for those purposes that god most needs to have done in the world
7608069 the place god calls you to is the place where your deep gladness and the worlds deep hunger meet
7608070 simon simon peter listen satan has asked excessively that all of you be given up to him out of the power and keeping of god that he might sift all of you like grain but i have prayed especially for you peter that your own faith may not fail and when you yourself have turned again strengthen and establish your brethren
7608071 for no temptation no trial regarded as enticing to sin no matter how it comes or where it leads has overtaken you and laid hold on you that is not common to man that is no temptation or trial has come to you that is beyond human resistance and that is not adjusted and adapted and belonging to human experience and such as man can bear but god is faithful to his word and to his compassionate nature and he can be trusted not to let you be tempted and tried and assayed beyond your ability and strength of resistance and power to endure but with the temptation he will always also provide the way out the means of escape to a landing place that you may be capable and strong and powerful to bear up under it patiently
7608072 for we do not have a high priest who is unable to understand and sympathize and have a shared feeling with our weaknesses and infirmities and liability to the assaults of temptation but one who has been tempted in every respect as we are yet without sinning let us then fearlessly and confidently and boldly draw near to the throne of grace the throne of gods unmerited favor to us sinners that we may receive mercy for our failures and find grace to help in good time for every need appropriate help and well timed help coming just when we need it
7608073 i am the vine you are the branches whoever lives in me and i in him bears much abundant fruit however apart from me cut off from vital union with me you can do nothing
7608074 gods glory is on tour in the skies god craft on exhibit across the horizon
7608075 dear god please let me be the person that my dog thinks i am
7608076 he will cover you with his feathers and under his wings you will find refuge his faithfulness will be your shield and rampart
7608077 indeed he who watches over israel will neither slumber nor sleep
7608078 for the eyes of the lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth to show himself strong in behalf of those whose hearts are blameless toward him
7608079 is there anyplace i can go to avoid your spirit
7608080 oh he even sees me in the dark at night im immersed in the light
7608081 yet i am always with you you hold me by my right hand you guide me with your counsel and afterward you will take me into glory whom have i in heaven but you and earth has nothing i desire besides you my flesh and my heart may fail but god is the strength of my heart and my portion forever those who are far from you will perish you destroy all who are unfaithful to you but as for me it is good to be near god i have made the sovereign lord my refuge i will tell of all your deeds
7608082 the lord your god is in the midst of you a mighty one a savior who saves he will rejoice over you with joy he will rest in silent satisfaction and in his love he will be silent and make no mention of past sins or even recall them he will exult over you with singing
7608083 and therefore the lord earnestly waits expecting looking and longing to be gracious to you and therefore he lifts himself up that he may have mercy on you and show loving kindness to you for the lord is a god of justice blessed happy fortunate to be envied are all those who earnestly wait for him who expect and look and long for him for his victory his favor his love his peace his joy and his matchless unbroken companionship
7608084 as the hart pants and longs for the water brooks so i pant and long for you o god
7608085 so also good deeds are evident and conspicuous and even when they are not they cannot remain hidden indefinitely
7608086 oh the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of god how unfathomable inscrutable unsearchable are his judgments his decisions and how untraceable mysterious undiscoverable are his ways his methods his paths
7608087 i love you fervently and devotedly o lord my strength
7608088 were making cuts now its a one year fix to get us through the next year were focused on the long term and its my hope that we can restore publication as soon as possible he said this morning in a phone interview
7608089 were doing this basically to ensure we dont get into deep financial problems he said were not an organization with deep
7608090 we get advertising from several agencies and theres been a big drop
7608091 i believe in his ideals and his proposals to lead this nation
7608092 that no bartender however talented can remember how to make all of them or even half of them
7608093 no man short of a giant could try them all and nine tenths of them i believe would hardly be worth trying
7608094 im not afraid of them especially as i know that im doing the right thing and i dont see them as my enemies
7608095 i do think about this a lot but what are they going to do are they going to kill me
7608096 if they want to kill me let them do it im not going to stop anyone its going to be my freedom
7608097 my souls going to be free of my body not flesh any more
7608098 palestinians look really ugly in front of everybody in the world and they are very very good people they are misled and their picture is very dark because of this leadership
7608099 they need some help they need people to stop lying to them and lying to the world
7608100 they are not a regular family they are a very famous family and muslims around the world praise my family praise my father so when i came with a step like this it was impossible to think about it was crazy
7608101 i knew from the beginning my family would face an impossible situation it wasnt their choice but they have had to carry it with me its difficult for my mother shes crying all day long every time i talk to her shes crying
7608102 but at the same time he sent me a message of love
7608103 he loves me as a son and he believes that what ive done was something i believed in but at the same time its very difficult for him to understand and he wont be able to understand
7608104 hamas they are using civilians lives they are using children they are using the suffering of people every day to achieve their goals and this is what i hate
7608105 its not taking them anywhere its making them look ugly
7608106 killing others cutting hands cutting legs torturing people and asking for destruction of entire civilisations
7608107 live my life away from violence because i couldnt coexist with that situation as a christian
7608108 i was thinking what is my responsibility now to see people dying every day or to stand up and say this is wrong this is right and be strong about this so i had to make this move
7608109 i know this take a longer time but this is the right way to do it to build a new generation a new generation who understand how to forgive how to love
7608110 he is most certainly the face of things to come an ambassador to those oppressed by islam he is passionate about liberating his brothers and sisters from the darkness of a false religion and living the truth that jesus is the way the truth and the light
7608111 it is upsetting not only to his community and to his family but to all muslims
7608112 but the worst impact is on his family and his father this is a thing that is more unique to our middle eastern culture it is the most difficult thing to convert from one religion to another
7608113 i didnt come to christianity for money i came to christianity because this is the way we can live a better life
7608114 i love my people they have the right to live like any other nation on earth but at the same time i want to help them get on the right track
7608115 we dont know why he was walking through our hotel
7608116 with regard to firearms the citizen acts at his peril
7608117 what if the usual methods fail if this status quo remains what then
7608118 its well known that when you drink you get a buzz but a couple of hours later that initial impact at least is gone
7608119 there is always a very delicate balance between newly formed cells and dying cells
7608120 its a very active period of that balance because usually you develop a surplus of tissue then later melt it back down to acquire a specific shape
7608121 the digits form because the inter digital tissue dies if it did not die we would have paddles instead of hands with fingers
7608122 you have to make people aware of the science behind the risk
7608123 we are not saying that every pregnant woman who drinks three or four glasses of wine in a short period will have a baby with birth defects but it elevates the risk
7608124 acetylsalicylic acid aspirin is based on a plant stress hormone
7608125 i asked myself could there be other plant stress hormones that have clinical efficacy while various studies have suggested that aspirin can prevent cancer especially colon cancer i realized that there could be a chance to find a potent plant hormone that could fight cancer even better i pinpointed jasmonate
7608126 the jasmonate compound is used widely in agriculture and in cosmetics
7608127 proven to be non toxic it has the same regulatory status as table salt that and the fact we are working on a natural chemical gives us a good starting point for launching a new drug
7608128 has already been shown to have selective anticancer activity in preclinical studies and this finding may stimulate the development of a novel class of small anticancer compounds
7608129 we made several improvements in the technique that could allow us to perform this type of procedure routinely
7608130 we traditionally try to save the kidney for smaller tumors performing a robotic partial nephrectomy
7608131 for larger tumors however patients would get a very large incision on their side now we can remove kidneys with cancer through a single three inch incision near the patients belly button
7608132 i think this is going to be a big advance for having to remove the entire kidney because of large kidney tumors this could be a great improvement over traditional open and laparoscopic surgeries
7608133 the robotic instruments are like having my hands inside the body
7608134 we think well see the same advantages with robotic kidney surgery as we have with robotic prostatectomy
7608135 we are turning the heat up on idol this year and are thrilled to welcome kara to the judges table
7608136 she is a smart sassy lady and one of america s most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7608137 we had originally intended for american idol to have four judges
7608138 weve seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers
7608139 for the past seven seasons paula has had to endure the experience of being the only woman at the judges table shes been as an island of consideration and gentle criticism between randy and simon offering her invaluable expertise as a performer and no 1 artist to the thousands who have competed on american idol with kara by her side paula finally has some back up and now there is going to be a lot more girl power on the show
7608140 in the best case scenario this would open up the window of time that people could recover and go back to normal functional status
7608141 offers the potential for stroke patients to recover return to nearly normal functional status and stay out of nursing homes

7608146 that was a stupid idea youre gonna get a bad reputation and youre sad cos all you ever wanna do is get off people and dont need to get off with someone to have a good time
7608147 you made yourself look like you were easy and i bet hes gonna spead it all round hes probably told his mates already

7608149 photos of us doing things in the rooms in which we would actually do them
7608150 it started off hey cutie where you from and then it turned into oh no what have i done this song rocks thanks aidan save a prayer duran duran
7608151 love is the giving of energy and gratitude is the receiving of energy the two makes the complete exchange of energy in the universe
7608152 files cannot be copied moved your disk might be full
7608153 so goes the dollar so goes the energy complex these days
7608154 the storm is trying to pull the market higher but its not getting much of a boost
7608155 from the caribbean to the caspian weve had one bullish headline after another and the market cannot generate a sustained rally
7608156 it certainly doesnt bode well for anyone who owns commodities
7608157 we continue to see little chance for oil to be used by russia as a bargaining tool

7608181 i was disappointed that the general assembly rejected the proposal to reduce the blood alcohol content for motorists towing wider boat trailers since it endangers lives

7608188 the limited success of existing therapy suggested to us that factors besides erbb2 or proteins that collude with erbb2 might nullify the effects of herceptin and lapatinib
7608189 our results might explain why the strategy of using erbb2 inhibitors alone to treat breast cancers has fallen short
7608190 these findings may also suggest a way to treat patients with advanced erbb2 positive tumors and those whove developed resistance to erbb2 inhibitors an idea that were eager to test
7608191 if erbb2 is the accelerator that makes the car move brk helps shift the gear to gain more speed
7608192 we might need to hit erbb2 expressing cancers with drugs against both erbb2 and brk
7608193 brk does not promote the proliferation of normal cells and its expression in normal tissues is restricted to non proliferating cells
7608194 produce fewer unwanted side effects than targeting other cancer promoting proteins
7608195 we also think that brk would be an ideal clinical marker than could be used to provide both a diagnosis and prognosis for breast cancer

7608227 the volunteers are getting the inside ready and then will flip it and do the exterior
7608228 it will be deep green on the bottom with two yellow stripes on top those were the traditional colors
7608229 he had his shop in the place behind where the camera shop on shore road is
7608230 he launched the boats at the end of wharf lane there were a lot of wharfs there originally
7608231 she designed it from pictures there was no plan of a dory anywhere but plenty of pictures

7608238 me and tim have some unfinished business nothing against him personally hes a nice guy and all but he flat out cheated in our fight lets see how he does against me straight up with no pharmaceutical enhancements lets find out who the better man really is im ready whenever you are tim
7608239 for four straight years i went undefeated stopping every single opponent in the first round with just one exception and that exception was josh barnett we fought in the first ever super heavyweight bout in ufc history and i rocked him hard in round one i nearly put him away but he caught me in round two winning by tko due to strikes at 4 34 josh is a great fighter and id love to rumble with him one more time cause it sure would feel good to smash him around the cage again
7608240 i think kimbo is bad for mma period and im the right man to remove him from the sport for good next
7608241 brocks a big strong guy and hed face an interesting challenge for me hes got plenty of size and power and so do i he has a stellar amateur wrestling background and i was trained in college by the legendary dan gable it would be a great test for both of us
7608242 this would be an excellent matchup because of our styles i respect kongo and think hed be the ideal gateway fighter for me to break back into the top tier of the division
7608243 ive looked up to randy for many many years i met him for the first time when i was just a kid at a wrestling camp hes a real good guy and yknow because of our age difference and relationship fighting randy would be kind of like fighting my dad no offense randy but id love to do it
7608244 i faced herring in osaka japan it was my first fight since all that controversy went down at ufc 44 with sylvia and i took the fight on short notice losing a split decision no excuses though herring won and hes an exciting world class fighter i really hope i get an opportunity to avenge that loss cause it still bugs me
7608245 why do i want to fight fedor so badly because hes currently the best heavyweight in the world and if you dont want to face the best you have no business in mma personally i think this would be a helluva matchup the kind of fight that would have fans on their feet from beginning to end id have a ten inch height advantage over fedor and would fight him as the bigger man making him fight shorter than he actually is id utilize my reach making fedor come to me and when he comes in close id take him out
7608246 bring em all on look i didnt return to mma just to collect a few paychecks this is all about my legacy about finally establishing myself as the number one heavyweight on the planet when im at my best i know how good i am and the only one who can stop me is me ive watched all those other heavyweights and believe me i fear no one any time any place boys
7608247 remember me with smiles and laughter for thats how i will remember you all if you can only remember me with tears then dont remember me at all
7608248 yes i was wondering if you had x model of y brand on display

7608250 such is the reliance and confidence that we have through christ toward and with reference to god
7608251 in you o lord i have taken refuge let me never be put to shame
7608252 be my rock of refuge to which i can always go give the command to save me for you are my rock and my fortress
7608253 for you have been my hope o sovereign lord my confidence since my youth
7608254 i have become like a portent to many but you are my strong refuge
7608255 my mouth is filled with your praise declaring your splendor all day long
7608256 be not far from me o god come quickly o my god to help me
7608257 but as for me i will always have hope i will praise you more and more
7608258 my mouth will tell of your righteousness of your salvation all day long though i know not its measure
7608259 i will come and proclaim your mighty acts o sovereign lord i will proclaim righteousness yours alone
7608260 since my youth o god you have taught me and to this day i declare your marvelous deed
7608261 even when i am old and gray do not forsake me o god till i declare your power to the next generation your might to all who are to come
7608262 your righteousness reaches to the skies o god you who have done great things who o god is like you
7608263 though you have made me see troubles many and bitter you will restore my life again from the depths of the earth you will bring me up
7608264 you will increase my honor and comfort me once again

7608294 hi mom im writing in my bible just like you
7608295 how sweet are your words to my taste sweeter than honey to my mouth i gain understanding from your precepts therefore i hate every wrong path your word is a lamp to my feet and a light for my path my heart is set on keeping your decrees to the very end
7608296 for it is the daily ordinary parts of life that are the glue or maybe even the bookends that encompass the spectacular that is what i call my life

7608301 i know that you can do all things no plans of yours can be thwarted
7608302 surely i spoke of things i did not understand things too wonderful for me to know
7608303 my ears had heard of you but now my eyes have seen you therefore i despise myself and repent in dust and ashes
7608304 i am angry with you and your two friends because you have not spoken of me what is right as my servant job has so now take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant job and sacrifice a burnt offering for yourselves my servant job will pray for you and i will accept his prayer and not deal with you according to your folly you have not spoken of me what is right as my servant job has
7608305 after job had prayed for his friends the lord made him prosperous again and gave him twice as much as he had before all his brothers and sisters and everyone who had known him before came and ate with him in his house they comforted and consoled him over all the trouble the lord had brought upon him in his house and each gave him a piece of silver and a gold ring
7608306 the lord blessed the latter part of jobs life more than the first

7608316 dont be afraid am i in the place of god you intended to harm me but god intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done the saving of many lives

7608378 our work uncovers an achilles heel of influenza a viruses that cause human epidemics and high mortality pandemics
7608379 we have identified the structure of a key target site for drugs that could be developed to effectively combat this disease
7608380 the x ray crystal structure gives us unique insights into how the ns1 and human protein bind at the atomic level and how that suppresses a crucial antiviral response
7608381 these experiments validate the ns1 pocket as a target for antiviral drug discovery
7608382 because this ns1 pocket is highly conserved in all influenza a viruses isolated from humans a drug targeted to the pocket would be effective against all human influenza a strains including the bird flu
7608383 this work underscores the value of scientific collaborations between large scale structural centers and individual biomedical research labs
7608384 an investment of 41 million in fertilizer research through 1981 returned an incredible 57 billion to u s agriculture
7608385 that doesnt include benefits of the technology to the rest of the world
7608386 tvas fertilizer program is recognized as one of the most effective research and development programs of any u s agency its benefits to the world far outweigh the public investment that the united states made in fertilizer research and development
7608387 its time to launch a radical initiative to develop a new generation of energy efficient fertilizers to help avert hunger and famine
7608388 tva technology fueled the sweeping advances of u s farmers in food and fiber production in the 60s to 80s
7608389 today fertilizers are responsible for more than a third of total u s crop production
7608390 the 57 billion return from a 41 million investment included about 49 billion from use of high analysis fertilizers and 8 billion from process development and improvement thats a benefit cost ratio of more than 20 to 1
7608391 tva followed promising new fertilizers from conception to production to national acceptance by farmers and the fertilizer industry
7608392 its program was based on fundamental research followed by process development and technology transfer
7608393 tva then stopped work on that project and moved to develop newer and more promising technologies
7608394 i am concerned about the state of the fertilizer industry itself
7608395 work should begin now on the next generation of fertilizer products using advanced techniques such as nanotechnology and molecular biology especially in conjunction with plant genetics research smart fertilizer products that will release nutrients only at the time and in the amount needed should be developed
7608396 the world needs a major research effort to improve the effectiveness of fertilizer production and use
7608397 fertilizer is a commodity industry and it is unlikely the industry alone will undertake the research some public investment is probably required
7608398 to decisively step up investment in science and technology for food and agriculture
7608399 the need for increased food is escalating but new agricultural technology is not keeping pace
7608400 an effective research program to develop a new range of fertilizers should be a key element of any long term strategy to alleviate the food crisis
7608401 most fertilizer products used today were developed when energy seemed abundant and cheap but with rising prices we should develop a new generation of fertilizer products that use plant nutrients more efficiently
7608402 such innovations will require investments in research but such costs would be miniscule compared to the benefits for humanity
7608403 ifdc is in a unique position to meet this challenge
7608404 biologists have known that in these beetles there is an investment trade off between secondary sexual characters and primary sexual characters
7608405 as horns get bigger copulatory organs get smaller or vice versa what was not known was how frequently and how fast this can occur in nature and whether this can drive the evolution of new species
7608406 in terms of the integrity of a species its important for these things not to change too much
7608407 so there is a lot of evidence suggesting that within species or within the populations of species natural selection maintains genital characters but if these primary sex characters are linked to other characters that can change readily then youve got what we think is a very exciting mechanism that could prime populations for reproductive isolation
7608408 if this is all it takes to change genitalia it may be easier to make new species than we thought

7608425 shortfalls in state budgets coupled with pessimistic predictions about local revenues are forcing them to look for ways to trim next school years budgets and educational technology programs could be among the casualties

7608616 there is growing beef consumption and demand with declining production thats a perfect setup for us
7608617 biologists have known that in these beetles there is an investment trade off between secondary sexual characters and primary sexual characters
7608618 as horns get bigger copulatory organs get smaller or vice versa what was not known was how frequently and how fast this can occur in nature and whether this can drive the evolution of new species
7608619 in terms of the integrity of a species its important for these things not to change too much
7608620 so there is a lot of evidence suggesting that within species or within the populations of species natural selection maintains genital characters but if these primary sex characters are linked to other characters that can change readily then youve got what we think is a very exciting mechanism that could prime populations for reproductive isolation
7608621 if this is all it takes to change genitalia it may be easier to make new species than we thought

7608629 felipe seems to be getting on very well with the ferrari
7608630 and it is bloody quick at the moment my car is fast but theirs is that little bit faster the whole race is about reliability as well though ferrari can have the quickest car but if it isnt reliable thats their problem we have a really good package but we also have amazing reliability
7608631 it is something we need to fix and i am constantly telling the team as much so theyre working on it although it probably wont be sorted for the next grand prix
7608632 i feel a lot stronger than i did this time last year
7608633 i think it is just maturity and knowing what you need if there had been a race like valencia last season i would have driven my heart out without really thinking about why i was doing it id have wanted to win nothing else and wouldnt have had my mind on scoring points
7608634 last year i meant business i was there to tell the world i wasnt half a second slower than fernando alonso as some people predicted i was thinking hang on im no no 2 whoever you put me next to even michael schumacher i was there to prove how good i was which i did but this year i want to top that my sole focus is to win the world championship
7608635 how can we believe in when you select such a veteran

7608642 that seems to be trend these days isnt it mate
7608643 if it was me obviously id like every game to be on all platforms so id only have to buy one perhaps that could happened in the future but right now it doesnt
7608644 i see where you misunderstood me here im not advocating one platform there could be multiple platforms with all these unique features but games in generation would work or even just be released on all of them as an example say i wanted to buy the wii for its control and price id buy that and be able to get the whole library of games on it obviously the problem would be hardware but if there was a standard much like with the dvd i think it could work out fine i dont know could happened probably wont id like it to because i own the 360 and the ps3 and i desperately want to get rid of one but there are like three exclusives on each that pull me towards keeping them

7608680 two or three years ago i used to sell fish for 500 u s dollars a week but now one would be lucky if he catches fish for five dollars
7608681 we expected things might change better after the truce but nothing has changed they still shoot at us and sometimes detain us for long hours and force us to strip off and swim back to the shore
7608682 the restriction policy significantly scaled down the amount size and variety of fish that fishermen can catch
7608683 the fishing sector has witnessed stern instability during the past five years this is mainly because of israeli restrictions imposed on fishermen
7608684 israel naval soldiers shoot at any boat trying to exceed the 3 mile fishing area which is stumpy and out of rocks that fish take as shelters
7608685 i was going to buy more boats but after the intifada fishing has been the job of loss not of making money
7608686 even if i had money to buy new boats and other fishing facilities there has to be free water to catch as much fish as i can to cover the costs of the boats and my workers
7608687 with this money i cannot afford to pay my workers let it alone support my family

7608717 the point is that my mother cleaned houses to send me to this college
7608718 none of us could make it in this faith alone we need sisters and brothers in the church the saints down through the centuries to teach us to pray

7608722 fear not what you meant for evil god meant for good
7608723 but its important always to point out that theres the official position and theres the huge amount of friendship and fellowship and worshipping together that goes on at all levels certainly between anglican and catholics and all the other groups and catholics
7608724 this is obviously not compatible with the doctrine of primacy which according to the catholic faith is an internal constitutive principle of the very existence of a particular church
7608725 however if such dialogue is to be truly constructive it must involve not just the mutual openness of the participants but also fidelity to the identity of the catholic faith
7608726 with the launch of the trade up incentive program in 2007 we were pleased although not surprised to learn that many mcintosh customers all over the country are proud owners of products that theyve been using and cherishing for many years the vast majority of these products still work just as well as the day they were purchased the fact is many mcintosh products not only withstand the test of time but also actually retain or even increase in value over the years last years trade up program allowed people to trade in their mcintosh amplifiers and this year were pleased to expand it to include a broader range of our luxury products
7608727 people who own mcintosh equimpment understand and appreciate the unique attributes of their products in terms of performance overall build quality and enduring value not surprisingly this makes our customers extremely loyal to our brand by expanding our trade up program were not only rewarding our customers for their loyalty and support but were communicating and underscoring the unique lasting value that our products offer to discriminating home entertainment enthusiasts everywhere

7609053 now behold two of them were traveling that same day to a village called emmaus which was seven miles from jerusalem and they talked together of all these things which had happened so it was while they conversed and reasoned that jesus himself drew near and went with them but their eyes were restrained so that they did not know him

7609131 we do a number of campaigns and focus a lot on search paid and natural and a big reason why were using stream and why it became extremely attractive was the ability to recover some of the spend we have on the search side
7609132 we get people on the site but they dont register for whitepapers or webinars demandbase stream made it really easy to launch a campaign and watch who comes into the site where they go and find those people at those companies to start calling in with marketing
7609133 stream flips that model around because now we know who is coming to the site and which companies are interested

7609192 when the lord began to speak through hosea the lord said to him
7609193 go take to yourself an adulterous wife and children of unfaithfulness because the land is guilty of the vilest adultery in departing from the lord
7609194 i am a hebrew and i worship the lord the god of heaven who made the sea and the land
7609195 those who cling to worthless idols forfeit the grace that could be theirs but i with a song of thanksgiving with sacrifice to you what i have vowed i will make good salvation comes from the lord
7609196 the council has said they didnt want to have layoffs but personnel is 83 percent of the police departments budget
7609197 if the departments can cut their budgets a minimum of 5 percent maybe we can use reserves to stem the tide a while until we get a handle of whats going on
7609198 the council has eliminated some items and added others that werent included in the budget
7609199 were also looking at water and garbage rates park rentals and other fees
7609200 i will get her voters i am not so sure she can get mine

7609206 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here that they were elected to represent
7609207 that however they decide to vote we will all be united behind senator obama
7609208 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7609209 it would have been the same way if i had won and barack was here supporting the unity of the party
7609210 this was a hard fought campaign and there was a lot of intensity and passion associated with it in part because of the historic nature of our two candidacies
7609211 even before the convention and even before the complete reconciliation that we need

7609214 i saw when the judges blatantly stole fights from two cuban boxers in the semifinals
7609215 our fighters had hopes of winning despite the judges but it was useless they were condemned beforehand
7609216 every discipline every human and material resource that we dedicate to sport
7609217 all the believers were one in heart and mind no one claimed that any of his possessions was his own but they shared everything they had with great power the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the lord jesus and much grace was upon them all there were no needy persons among them for from time to time those who owned lands or houses sold them brought the money from the sales and put it at the apostles feet and it was distributed to anyone as he had need joseph a levite from cyprus whom the apostles called barnabas which means son of encouragement sold a field he owned and brought the money and put it at the apostles feet
7609218 they devoted themselves to the apostles teaching and to the fellowship to the breaking of bread and to prayer everyone was filled with awe and many wonders and miraculous signs were done by the apostles all the believers were together and had everything in common selling their possessions and goods they gave to anyone as he had need every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts they broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts praising god and enjoying the favor of all the people and the lord added to their number daily those who were being saved
7609219 how good and pleasant it is when brothers live together in unity it is like precious oil poured on the head running down on the beard running down on aarons beard down upon the collar of his robes it is as if the dew of hermon were falling on mount zion for there the lord bestows his blessing even life forevermore
7609220 after all this the lord afflicted jehoram with an incurable disease of the bowels in the course of time at the end of the second year his bowels came out because of the disease and he died in great pain his people made no fire in his honor as they had for his fathers jehoram was thirty two years old when he became king and he reigned in jerusalem eight years he passed away to no ones regret and was buried in the city of david but not in the tombs of the kings
7609221 he walked in the ways of his father asa and did not stray from them he did what was right in the eyes of the lord
7609222 o lord god of our fathers are you not the god who is in heaven you rule over all the kingdoms of the nations power and might are in your hand and no one can withstand you for we have no power to face this vast army that is attacking us we do not know what to do but our eyes are upon you
7609223 they worshiped the lord but they also served their own gods
7609224 even while these people were worshiping the lord they were serving their idols
7609225 for this god is our god for ever and ever he will be our guide even to the end
7609226 how is it that a passage from the word that i have always loved suddenly intensifies that affection because its context is rightfully in place
7609227 there are some things more painful than death going out into eternity without god
7609228 yet i am always with you you hold me by my right hand you guide me with your counsel and afterward you will take me into glory whom have i in heaven but you and earth has nothing i desire besides you my flesh and my heart may fail but god is the strength of my heart and my portion forever those who are far from you will perish you destroy all who are unfaithful to you but as for me it is good to be near god i have made the sovereign lord my refuge i will tell of all your deeds
7609229 lord there is no one like you to help the powerless against the mighty help us o lord our god for we rely on you and in your name we have come against this vast army o lord you are our god do not let man prevail against you
7609230 listen to me asa and all judah and benjamin the lord is with you when you are with him if you seek him he will be found by you but if you forsake him he will forsake you but as for you be strong and do not give up for your work will be rewarded
7609231 for the eyes of the lord range throughout the earth to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to him you have done a foolish thing and from now on you will be at war
7609232 go out and stand on the mountain in the presence of the lord for the lord is about to pass by
7609233 i have been very zealous for the lord god almighty the israelites have rejected your covenant broken down your altars and put your prophets to death with the sword i am the only one left and now they are trying to kill me too
7609234 go back the way you came and go to the desert of damascus when you get there anoint hazael king over aram also anoint jehu son of nimshi king over israel and anoint elisha son of shaphat from abel meholahto succeed you as prophet jehu will put to death any who escape the sword of hazael and elisha will put to death any who escape the sword of jehu yet i reserve seven thousand in israel all whose knees have not bowed down to baal and all whose mouths have not kissed him
7609235 the most secret sacred wish that lies deep down at the bottom of your heart the wonderful thing that you hardly dare to look at or to think about the thing that you would rather die than have anyone else know of because it seem to be so far beyond anything that you are or have at the present time that you fear that would be cruelly ridiculed if the mere thought of it were known that is just the very thing that god is wishing you to do or be for him and the birth of that marvelous wish in your soul the dawning of that secret dream was the voice of god telling you to arise and come up higher because he had need of you
7609236 we found that his actions were more in line with an assault than with a sexual battery it didnt appear to be an overt sexual act
7609237 im not surprised the harper government is doing this because i think theyre very embarrassed the economy is softening and they have nothing to propose to canadians
7609238 i think its a charade harpers up to no good here
7609239 parliament is working parliament is not dysfunctional this is an invention by mr harper to trigger an election
7609240 the big boost to infrastructure announced today reflects last years strong economic performance
7609241 the economic challenges were facing this year mean i can safely predict i wont make this kind of announcement 12 months from now
7609242 wont be able to move as quickly as we thought we could
7609243 las condiciones macroecon micas y pol ticas son potencialmente inquietantes

7609245 the initiative which runs from aug 2 through nov 28 will encourage area shoppers to purchase a balloon icon to support the cause
7609246 this is a cause that we are all very excited about here at the arcadia location with this initiative we have the opportunity to make a difference in so many peoples lives
7609247 the money we help to raise will support the work of hundreds of researchers in their search for better therapies and cures for leukemia lymphoma and myeloma the arcadia team is proud to be able to help and show our support
7609248 the leukemia amp lymphoma societys light the night walk is an evening walk that raises money to support cutting edge research and innovative programs that improve the quality of life of patients and their families
7609249 it is our intention to do the best we can here at the arcadia location to continue the support that our company has shown towards the organization that has been making years of a difference to families nationwide

7609255 i think he definitely didnt have his best day against me but playing him nine times i guess hes bound to have one off day out of all of them because there are times when i felt like there was nothing i could do
7609256 the goal is still the same and the pressure is still the same
7609257 the goal is to continue to improve my tennis and to continue playing a very good tournament
7609258 rafa will now feel what i had to feel for a very long time
7609259 so it will be interesting to see how he handles it but so far hes been great and hes played so well on all surfaces now maybe its nice to go into a grand slam for a change not having no 1 next to me and it should be interesting
7609260 i think its tough to play perfect for five years in a row
7609261 i think one big result and its turned around for him i know pretty much every player except for one that would take his bad year so i think you have to use a little bit of perspective hes created a monster for himself
7609262 we have a feeling that they have split up and went different ways from finding some of the jumpsuits throughout the city
7609263 o deserto uma obra de deus para onde ele dirige os seus eleitos

7609267 lord you have assigned me my portion and my cup
7609268 as the ark of the lord was entering the city of david michal daughter of saul watched from a window and when she saw king david leaping and dancing before
7609269 how the king of israel has distinguished himeslf today disrobing in the sight of the slave girls of his servants as any vulgar fellow would
7609270 may the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing in your sight o lord my rock and my redeemer
7609271 these were the chiefs of davids mighty men they together with all israel gave
7609272 all my longings lie open before you o lord my sighing is not hidden from you
7609273 but uriah slept at the entrance to the palace with all his masters servants and did not go down to his house uriahs said to david
7609274 benaiah son of johoiada was a valiant fighter from kabzeel who performed great exploits he struck down tow of moabs best men he also went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion
7609275 if the lord had not been on our side let israel say if the lord had not been on our side when men attacked us when their anger flared against us they would have swallowed us alive the floods would have engulfed us the torrents would have swept over us the raging waters would have swept us away praise be to the lord who has not let us be torn by their teeth our help is in the name of the lord the maker of heaven and earth
7609276 there have been days that i have waged war with a lot of strength there have also been days were i have been exhausted days where i stay behind with the supplies i pray i go to the one who supplies all my needs
7609277 if i want him to remain alive until i return what is that to you you must follow me
7609278 these things have i spoken to you that in me you may have peace in this world you will have tribulation but be of good cheer i have overcome the world
7609279 to tell you the truth i had no idea how it is supposed to be spelled
7609280 we need something like this to recharge the soil it probably wont be a total drought buster
7609281 we dont want to be instrumental in overthrowing any government we dont have any such intentions
7609282 this organization is a terrorist organization and created mayhem against public life
7609283 i think at the moment they definitely have the upper hand and we need to do something better
7609284 we are neither registered nor do we have any bank accounts
7609285 and they would like to see that moral complexity acknowledged not swept aside
7609286 i think weve helped move the party in a new direction that opened up the tent a little wider but weve done it by acting as a broker helping progressives connect better with middle america
7609287 the prime minister replied to say that he had asked the prosecutor general to hold a detailed investigation in order to clarify the matter
7609288 president mwanawasas health has always been a problem even before he started his presidential mandate
7609289 we are excited to delight amazon customers by offering guaranteed release date delivery of these new video game titles so that the games can arrive at their doors the first day theyre available
7609290 this means that thousands of gamers across the country can start playing the games they love on the day theyre released without having to stand in long lines or stay up all night to do it
7609291 there will be a lot of attention but i dont think it will cause a change in policy
7609292 its as tragic at 99 as it is at 101
7609293 heres a u n sanctioned mission carried out by nato and you still have people referring to it as bushs war and were the lackeys of the americans
7609294 its a big number and its growing every time i come to the bridge i always wish it was my last but you know in the back of your mind that its not going to be the last
7609295 its the least that i can do for these guys who are giving their lives
7609296 canadians are traditionally peacekeepers and so for us to lose that many its hard
7609297 its a great outpouring of support by ordinary canadians none of this was orchestrated by the government or by the town or anything like that its just people that want to come out and pay their respects
7609298 its too bad we didnt have more politicians here that might be less willing to send them over there

7609304 we have received a report from unamid representatives there that the police of the government said that they had a search warrant from the court authorizing them to enter kalma camp to search for arms and possible wanted persons
7609305 they entered on their own and it seems that there are clashes going on and now we are sending an investigation team to make the assessment of the situation
7609306 i have extended support to shibu soren no one is above the upa united progressive alliance
7609307 we have understood the problems and are sure the party president will take an appropriate decision
7609308 we have taken the decision after thorough discussion among the party leaders and after the ppp failed to fulfil promises made to restore the sacked judges
7609309 non partisan nationally respected and accepted by the coalition partners
7609310 i am saddened to announce this but we are left with no other option
7609311 we have all respect for the pml n and we expect that the party will review its decision in the larger national interest
7609312 we will request the pml n not to leave the coalition as the ppp is determined to restore the judges
7609313 this is a welcome step and we hope that sharif will join the apdm for the betterment of the country and democracy
7609314 we have now the required numbers and have no fear that the government will fall if the ppp pulls out from the provincial coalition in punjab
7609315 it is certainly not good for the country or for democracy and could prove a very bad patch in the countrys politics
7609316 we should avoid experimentation at this stage and not enter into dirty games
7609317 two people have died in two separate incidents this is most unfortunate
7609318 the situation is under control and we are closely monitoring it
7609319 there is violence in about two dozen villages in the district
7609320 some churches have been attacked and there were reports of sporadic violence
7609321 passenger and goods trains were not allowed to move from stations

7609323 the strategic combination of our groups will accelerate the realisation of our common aspiration that of becoming the most respected provider of business transformational services in the global market place
7609324 we believe the acquisition of axon will enable us to achieve some strategic corporate objectives including the expansion of our consulting capabilities required to engage with the large business transformation programmes of our marquee clients
7609325 the all cash deal includes 19 4 percent premium to the closing price of 5 025 pounds on the last business day prior to the announcement 31 7 percent premium to the average price of 4 56 pounds over the last three months and 33 1 percent premium to six month average price of 4 51 pounds the fully diluted equity value of axon is 407 1 million pounds
7609326 axon buyout will give us a global reach scale and financial strength to participate in large deals that are transformational for clients businesses
7609327 against the background of the global economic environment and increasing consolidation in the it services industry the combination with infosys represents a compelling proposition infosys offer represents an attractive cash premium and provides value to our shareholders
7609328 you make sure you are focused on what your goal is and what you want to achieve thats just all that i did i was focused on what i wanted to do and what i wanted to accomplish

7609330 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 metres

7609336 some of the decisions taken at the meeting include assessment of vulnerability of sensitive areas in designated sectors joint anti cattle smuggling drive as a pilot project immediate communication on the event of firing and informal meetings even in the absence of issues
7609337 cattle smuggling across the border has literally turned into an industry on an average 8 500 cattle are seized every month
7609338 the indian government has handed over unilaterally seven bangladeshi criminals and a similar response is expected from the bdr
7609339 they have handed us eight people but they are all petty criminals
7609340 regarding the terror camps for the first time the bdr has given us a proposal for joint action during which some of our representatives may accompany their forces but before any such thing the proposal needs to get clearance from respective governments
7609341 india is emerging as the most favoured destination for overseas investment and an important trading partner for the us
7609342 trade between india and the us is doubling in every three years indian industry has huge opportunity for cooperation with us companies in the energy sector especially to promote clean energy technologies
7609343 well take it game by game we want to give 100 percent and play the first game well and if there are any mistakes there we want to come back rectify them and finish off the series in a winning note
7609344 we won thanks to a good team effort and thats good to see not a single player had a bad game and hopefully that continues
7609345 we know kumar is a good enough player at any position but well probably have to do a rethink
7609346 we know they had only four bowlers but when you lose four wickets up front theres nothing much you can do we failed to make use of that slot where their fifth bowler would have come in
7609347 the depots would be re developed to facilitate construction of multi storeyed parking facility for buses and commercial development it would reduce the dtcs dependence on government and would also help the corporation to take up further improvement in the city transport and passenger amenities without any support from the government
7609348 the decision has been taken keeping in view his commendable contribution in coaching an olympic medal winner this would also inspire others to endeavour to achieve a similar feat and produce more medal winners for the nation

7609351 house and senate lawmakers agreed to permanently ban three types of phthalates from childrens toys and to outlaw three other phthalates from products pending an extensive study of their health effects in children and pregnant women
7609352 if one tv spot can get people thinking and talking about responsibility imagine what could happen if we went a step further

7609358 too fast too fast dont worry well let you get to the end of your sentence
7609359 this crack is moving and moving closer and closer to the front its just a matter of time till a much larger piece is going to break off it is imminent
7609360 as we see this phenomenon occurring further and further north and petermann is as far north as you can get it certainly adds to the concern
7609361 its a signal but we dont know what it means
7609362 the crack is not alarming i would say it is normal
7609363 in addition sen biden has a strong record in opposition to anti choice clinic violence and voted to hold anti choice extremists convicted of violent attacks against doctors and patients at womens reproductive health centers accountable for their criminal actions
7609364 sen biden who is a cosponsor of the landmark prevention first act also has joined us in supporting commonsense efforts to prevent unintended pregnancy by improving womens access to birth control ensuring teens receive accurate sex education and supporting family planning programs
7609365 global warming or climate change is occurring and it is primarily caused by human activity
7609366 americans just want to be left alone our enemies are determined not to leave us alone but our media our intellectuals and the democratic party are trying to soothe us and assure us that we dont actually have to fight anybody we can win just by sitting still and being america
7609367 instead of opposing magic and science it would be better to compare them as two parallel modes of acquiring knowledge their theoretical and practical results differ in value as science is certainly more successful than magic from this point of view although magic foreshadows science in that it also sometimes works but both science and magic require the same sort of mental operations which differ not so much in kind as in the different types of phenomena to which they are applied these relations are a consequence of the objective conditions in which magic and scientific knowledge appeared the history of the latter is short enough for us to know a good deal about it but the fact that modern science dates back only a few centuries raises a problem which ethnologiests have not yet sufficiently pondered the neolithic paradox would be a suitable name for it
7609368 barely blanched until green as grass retaining a fresh chlorophyll taste and a firm al dente texture that seemed to make sense with their spaghetti thin girth
7609369 when a subject becomes totally obsolete we make it a required course

7609373 im sorry beach goers that you are being forced to look at my fat please be patient as i attempt to submerge my lower half into water with some semblance of dignity
7609374 the world has enough women who are tough we need women who are tender there are enough women who are coarse we need women who are kind there are enough women who are rude we need women who are refined we have enough women of fame and fortune we need more women of faith we have enough greed we need more goodness we have enough vanity we need more virtue we have enough popularity we need more purity
7609375 my most recent analysis reveals a striking trend a generation of conservative young priests is on the rise in the u s church
7609376 we need a financial mechanism to create incentives for countries to conserve their forests and natural resources
7609377 to give them an alternative to cutting down their forests
7609378 as far as i am concerned we have not benefited from the forest apart from employment opportunities for a few of our young men
7609379 honey i know you can be brave it is going to be ok
7609380 what do you think the dr is just going to grab a stapler from his desk and bonk you on the head with it
7609381 i feel it i feel it it stings it stings
7609382 we had to resolve how to offer the service on the fly
7609383 it is an issue that is not really subject to debate
7609384 for the people with money this was not a problem
7609385 but for our people with no resources what could they do they went to clandestine clinics
7609386 we need a social licence the ok from the community to operate
7609387 we thought opportunities were getting better for young indian women but the harassment only seems to be getting worse
7609388 the latest statistics are terrifying and it clearly points to male rage
7609389 underneath our incredible social change the indian male is experiencing nothing short of a psychological frenzy
7609390 i was never really taught how to act around a girl
7609391 i thought teasing was the way to get them to notice me

7609461 nato should better supply our defence forces and thus boost estonias military capabilities
7609462 russias actions now are based on the logic of criminals if you beat someone you get respect
7609463 we need to help these countries develop sophisticated air defense and anti tank capabilities that dont pose any offensive threat to russia but promise the possibility of very high casualties were they to attempt what they did in georgia
7609464 nato has to make a fundamental decision here about its legal and ethical obligations and the only way we can really fulfil them is to help these countries defend themselves in advance of an attack
7609465 i think that russia does have designs on the baltic states and they have established a precedent in georgia where they think they can use force to defend russian minorities in other countries
7609466 had lithuania or estonia been the target of the recent russian campaign they would have been in a position to take ground in a very similar way to how they did in georgia
7609467 i think we are still very much at the diplomatic level in terms of dealing with these kind of disputes at present but i would think that something like might be on the table in terms of long term defensive planning measures
7609468 this will be a very challenging schedule for our team and will help prepare us for the wac championship meet in february

7609556 i am happy that aids related deaths have decreased by over 75 percent over the last four years in comparison with the aids related deaths we had in 2003 2004 because of increased free treatment

7609569 the adoption issue and its history has never been comprehensively addressed on a national level by the government of south korea
7609570 the main purpose of the national inquiry is to make the first decisive step in the process of documenting the full and complete history of international adoption from south korea
7609571 such an inquiry would rectify and reconcile the past in order to meet a bright collective future it would be a symbol of human dignity and civil justice and an act of human compassion for thousands and thousands of divided and shattered families on the korean peninsula

7609595 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here that they were elected to represent
7609596 that however they decide to vote we will all be united behind senator obama
7609597 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7609598 it would have been the same way if i had won and barack was here supporting the unity of the party
7609599 this was a hard fought campaign and there was a lot of intensity and passion associated with it in part because of the historic nature of our two candidacies

7609604 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7609605 we had originally intended for american idol to have four judges
7609606 weve seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers

7609608 the trilaterals that ive had have been useful in helping the two sides to find areas of convergence and thats what were going to continue to do
7609609 undoubtedly it will not be my last trip here so i think its a good time to do this
7609610 to continue to work on some of the issues on the ground
7609611 and so i honor that when we go to the trilaterals because i think its extremely important just to keep making forward progress rather than trying prematurely to come to some set of conclusions
7609612 we continue to have the same goal which is to reach agreement by the end of the year a lot of work ahead to do that and obviously its a complicated time
7609613 unfortunately to date our demands have not been addressed rather more civilians including women and children are losing their lives as a result of air raids
7609614 the incident is under investigation we dont have a timetable on when it will be completed
7609615 coalition forces make every effort to prevent the injury or loss of innocent lives
7609616 expressed his condolences to the people affected in the airstrike

7609626 developments lately in georgia have increased the importance of this visit
7609627 were being treated by the city of denver and the secret service like political prisoners like pariahs
7609628 were going to stay here for just a couple of minutes to state our disgust with this abomination the way the city and secret service are tearing the constitution of the united states to shreds and then we will leave

7609648 they wanted to enter europe in a big way and probably this is the reason why they have paid a higher premium
7609649 its a positive sign for the company because they were sitting on a huge cash pile and it was not generating any return
7609650 the objective is to create a leading global sap services provider
7609651 there is strong demand for these sevices and this will allow us to leverage the capabilities and strengths of both to have global reach scale and financial strength to participate in deals that are large
7609652 our stated policy is to move up the value chain move into the consultancy space
7609653 we have already made a lot of investments in this space and this is a continuation of that policy
7609654 theres no question that russia remains in violation of that agreement
7609655 we still see large numbers of russian troops in undisputed territory we see them maintaining checkpoints we still see the activity in poti
7609656 we continue to encourage them to live up to the commitment that their president made that they would fully withdraw and live up to the agreement
7609657 im an obama supporter and as of two days ago a biden supporter

7609662 i didnt know she knew who i was so it was pretty cool
7609663 shes one of the most successful teenagers and its an honor to be compared to her success
7609664 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here that they were elected to represent
7609665 that however they decide to vote we will all be united behind senator obama
7609666 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7609667 it would have been the same way if i had won and barack was here supporting the unity of the party
7609668 this was a hard fought campaign and there was a lot of intensity and passion associated with it in part because of the historic nature of our two candidacies
7609669 even before the convention and even before the complete reconciliation that we need
7609670 are you strong enough to be my man or my president
7609671 what im hearing from sen obama is a lot like what we heard from robert kennedy
7609672 no matter what campaign ad we see or how its spun hope is important its what this country was based on
7609673 that tag that sen obamas been given is a campaign ploy obviously by the republican party
7609674 i dont see him hanging out i have yet to see him at any celebrity events
7609675 this is the first time that a political convention of any sort has been surrounded with the awareness of environmental issues
7609676 yeah and regardless of what political affiliation you want to align yourself with this is an issue its real no matter which side you decide to attack it from
7609677 its like honey what do you want to be a pariah what do you want to be crucified its a good thing in this country we dont have to tell anybody its no ones business who we vote for
7609678 as if in deep contemplation perfectly fitting to an emperor who was more of a philosopher than of a soldier

7609684 seeing her love and affection with those three i know shell be an amazing mom unless i bat 100 perhaps a boy awaits us
7609685 were having a ball im the luckiest guy in the world
7609686 yeah we are definitely and were probably not going to stop at one
7609687 i told them theyre nuts how are they going to make any money on it
7609688 its about this really amazing company that started in sleepy sacramento and ended up becoming the predominant music retail chain in the world and then kind of disappeared
7609689 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7609690 its very clear that for a long period of time there may have been people in different parts of this province right here and elsewhere who were at risk and whose safety was in peril because the tssa was asleep at the switch
7609691 this decision was based on a thorough review of the information currently available and the immediate nature of the potential hazards associated with operations at those particular sites
7609692 we will know something more in the next day or so
7609693 you know that and i know that and im sure god knows that too doing your best is more important than being the best
7609694 were not supposed to get more than one injury a day i usually get three or four
7609695 i have a responsible grown up life but peel back the trousers and i am a hot blooded undieboi

7609697 the mx 1100 is the first non gaming mouse i have seen with a switch for adjusting sensitivity the adjustment is towards the front of the mouse right next to the left main mouse button the scroll wheel can be pressed for middle mouse button click this was something several previous logitech mice using the free wheel scroll wheel lacked
7609698 comfortable start for murray not usually the best news because he tends to drop off when comfortably ahead no excuses today though has to be three easy sets
7609699 re 2010 a sketchy performance i fancy andy in four though
7609700 i definitely saw that with my siblings i saw that with my friends
7609701 and i was probably close to going that path but i always liked school but it was hard you know trying to finish every year with good grades
7609702 the biggest barrier to college education for first generation students is sort of feeling of being a fraud
7609703 a lot of people also have generalized things like oh you mexicans are really hard workers
7609704 sure but i like to think of myself as no im a lazy bum or i like to sit and read and when that actually takes you further than working so hard i feel like im capable just like anyone else to be able to become a ceo or start my own organization
7609705 the biggest barrier to college education for first generation students is sort of feeling of being a fraud
7609706 a lot of times first generation college students feel like ive made it this far im kind of fooling people theyre going to find me out any day now that i dont really belong here and they get those messages of not belonging in so many different subtle ways
7609707 what a lot of the programs provide is exactly what the students are missing which is college knowledge
7609708 the real understanding of not only the technical aspects of getting to college how to apply the financial aide aspects how to choose a career those more technical pieces but also the social aspects being motivated having people telling them they can do it they can get there
7609709 i remember my mom telling me its your decision really its something we dont know much about we cant help you and we dont have the money to help you either to do any of this
7609710 our units are ready but if the tatas decide to move out we are ready we can supply from our other units which are not captive for the project unlike singur we have some inventory at other units also
7609711 we are with the tatas we came here with them wherever they go we will go
7609712 i dont believe so mamata banerjee should recognise the economics of the whole project this is a business issue and not a political one
7609713 there were two considerations a world class car and the price if we shift it will add to the cost
7609714 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7609715 automatic mental associations predict future choices of undecided decision makers
7609716 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here that they were elected to represent
7609717 that however they decide to vote we will all be united behind senator obama
7609718 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7609719 it would have been the same way if i had won and barack was here supporting the unity of the party
7609720 this was a hard fought campaign and there was a lot of intensity and passion associated with it in part because of the historic nature of our two candidacies
7609721 even before the convention and even before the complete reconciliation that we need
7609722 but to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7609723 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7609724 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7609725 there was this loud boom and then it felt like the whole house was energized
7609726 the lights went out and me and my wife jumped out of bed
7609727 i knew lightning hit something but i thought it was my basketball net or the big tree outside
7609728 i stated yelling get out the house is on fire
7609729 i brought out some appliances i moved two cars from the garage
7609730 its been crazy this year nuts worse than any year i can remember
7609731 some people say it is because of a lot of ore deposits in the area or the topography but i dont know if i buy that
7609732 it might have something to do with the number of homes here though
7609733 it wants to get to the ground through the path of least resistance
7609734 alex was in bed watching television when the lightning hit
7609735 i had just checked up on him 15 minutes before

7609743 they set up their lights against a sprinkler head against instructions there is now a major flood in their booth
7609744 feel sorry for me because i still love the little girl you once were
7609745 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7609746 while we are pleased that mr houari has finally been released from guantanamo bay something that should have occurred years ago the lack of notice as to his whereabouts is unconscionable particularly in light of his well documented mental health history
7609747 ive got news for you from your friend sally kern she says were still looking for the gay agenda will you bring it to us and i said well sally youve gotta stop walking into the capitol with your guns on
7609748 i am an out transgendered person in ny i am not an elected official i am just a girl with a job
7609749 the democratic party is the party of my parents and my grandparents it is the party of diversity and equality new ideas take time and effort and energy
7609750 i look forward to the day where transgendered people will be able to have basic civil rights in schools at home and in health care
7609751 i grew up in a home where my father was very norwegian in a family that was very lutheran probably just as important or maybe more important i have just always enjoyed building things
7609752 if youre a norwegian it would seem insulting to have someone in this country do a replica and then not do a replica
7609753 obviously we wanted accurate replication because why would you do a replica if you didnt do the best job you could
7609754 the one fun story i love to relate to people around the state is when the rolling stones were here and mick jaggers personal trainer who is norwegian opened his window the morning after theyd flown in and looked out and there sat the stave church
7609755 he was excited and ran all the way over here to see if he really saw what he thought he saw i understand he dragged poor mick through to make sure he understood a little bit about his trainers heritage and history
7609756 i suppose those that dont like it they probably dont say anything
7609757 those that seem to enjoy it are very complimentary and thats always nice and you see people on the street and they say something quite pleasant those who dont care about it probably say hes a nut that shouldnt have been but thats okay
7609758 the main thing probably is we met an awful lot of nice people that i wouldnt have otherwise met
7609759 so maybe thats just as important as anything you know

7609766 now in a first for me im supporting a republican john mccain i respect his maverick and independent streak and now hes the one with the experience and judgment a lot of democrats will vote mccain its ok really
7609767 this ad does not reflect the sentiment of the thousands of former clinton supporters from my congressional district who have embraced barack obamas message of uniting americans and getting the country back on track
7609768 cheap political stunts like this ad show that john mccain is offering more of the same four more years of failed bush policies and a record of supporting george bush 95 of the time and losing track of how many houses he owns hillary clinton supporters are embracing barack obama and joe biden
7609769 theres nothing independent about having voted with george bush 95 of the time and there is little maverick about promising to continue george bushs failed economic policies and plan for an indefinite occupation of iraq
7609770 lets me know im never alone when i stand up
7609771 this is the most energetic caucus ive seen imagine all the potential we could do collectively and collaboratively we need to thank our straight allies who are in this room and we must focus and invest on the future
7609772 the doctrines of jesus are simple and tend to all the happiness of man
7609773 im here endorsing sen mccain because i believe in his ideas and his proposal to lead this nation
7609774 and like i said before hes been a fighter for the hispanic community and i know that me personally i choose him as the best candidate because hes a fighter for the immigration issue so for me hes the best guy to lead this nation
7609775 my babe doesnt stop from hanging out because she likes gasoline
7609776 i have a very honorable opponent and one who will receive the nomination of his party this week in denver and i look forward to the last couple months of the campaign with him

7609793 if people had good albums theyd be buying albums but people are buying singles because they only have good songs
7609794 the program director at a radio station by the way is not the superstar
7609795 if he was a superstar hed be out creating songs but hes not but he wants to act like he has control and power
7609796 i truly believe that people like myself who are in a position of entertainers in the limelight should keep their mouth shut on politics
7609797 because at the end of the day let me tell you what i m good at im good at writing songs and singing what im not educated in is the field of political science and so for me to be sharing my views and influencing people of who i think they should be voting for i think would be very irresponsible on my part so ill just keep my mouth shut on that
7609798 because as soon as somebody comes out for a politician especially in hollywood when they all go im voting for this guy
7609799 i dont hate her i just dont believe in her so i dont want any part of any of that i think celebrities hurt politicians
7609800 make sure you vote this november even if its just to spite oprah
7609801 theres a real problem with this internet thing and everyone thinking they have a voice
7609802 this is what the internet and bloggers are all about
7609803 the most organized human being i have ever met in my entire life
7609804 i feel very very lucky to have spent so many years with him learning from him being friends with him thats what gives me a lot of comfort
7609805 im sure i will always whenever i have a major decision to make think in my head what would tim say what would tim do that will be with me i know forever
7609806 who could sanely argue that a story about a strong military power at a state of war with georgia is less important than one about a few coins
7609807 the georgia story should have been on the front page both because of the implications of that conflict but also because for readers in europe it is essentially a local story
7609808 failing to adequately cover this important issue leads me to question the priorities and integrity of stars and stripes
7609809 imaginar que as pessoas v o votar por causa da placa de fulano ou beltrano subestimar a intelig ncia do povo da nossa cidade eu fui o ltimo a entrar em campanha leva um tempo at as pessoas terem consci ncia de quem s o os candidatos

7609811 michelle do you have any words for the swedish women
7609812 i didnt know it was going to be so loud
7609813 this is a family owned business were working our way out of it
7609814 the stakes of this election will be made very clear
7609815 knowing they will have a first lady who understands their challenges
7609816 back in june and july i truly thought he was going to blow mccain out of the water and carry 30 or 40 states
7609817 what has happened is that republicans mccain specifically have really twisted his great charisma this electric personality to discredit his ability his experience his capacity his judgment i fear they are about to do to him what they did to gore
7609818 obama has got to do some things that will shore up his ability to lead not just to charm but to lead theyve got to give credibility to his understanding of foreign policy his ability to deal with tough people and tough questions and his ability to be more explicit and convincing on his health care policies and energy policies
7609819 normally i might say these conventions are not so important but i dont think thats the case this year
7609820 i think in the case of mccain they need to frame him
7609821 viscerally my feeling is theyve got to come back at him hard

7609825 achamos que o ideal que o candidato j possa ir divulgando os seus financiadores e que isso seja praticado por todos quanto maior a transpar ncia maior o controle social sobre a atividade p blica melhor a qualidade e legalidade dos gastos
7609826 o eleitor consciente est sempre procurando a maior quantidade poss vel de informa es sobre os candidatos no brasil historicamente a rela o de financiadores de campanha com os pol ticos foi sempre muito prom scua o eleitor poderia saber quem est bancando o candidato e isso poderia ser uma informa o relevante no processo de escolha
7609827 a pessoa quando doa vem em cima da lei eleitoral que prev que devemos informar as receitas e despesas a cada m s mas a os doadores no final dos processos eleitorais essas pessoas que ajudaram a nossa campanha doaram em cima da lei eleitoral eu prefiro respeitar a lei eleitoral

7609835 the values that drive him experiences that shaped him and why i believe he will be an extraordinary president ill also share stories about my life and my background with the country
7609836 youll have a sense of who she is and what our values are and how were raising our kids and i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us he comes from a middle class background he went to school on scholarships he had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about child care they had to figure out how to start a college fund for their kids
7609837 it isnt just a privacy issue it is a trespassing issue with their own photos as evidence
7609838 they really went off the track to get to our address
7609839 he was accused of offending state institutions destabilising public security and inciting demonstrations and strikes via the internet
7609840 state security decided to release him on august 17 but an order to arrest him was issued under the state emergency law
7609841 packed with armed men wearing police and security forces uniforms hit us with rocket propelled grenades and machine guns
7609842 they were surprised by heavy gunfire from within the camp there was an exchange of fire and a number of victims
7609843 if government forces carry out more attacks against our people the sla is ready to confront and retaliate
7609844 the government sent a strong military force and attacked the camp with the intention of killing civilians
7609845 severely threaten the safety and security of civilians who have a right to protection

7609851 angry odinga supporters crying fraud sparked riots that resulted in some 1 500 deaths amid his ancestral countrys civil unrest sen barack obama took time out from the campaign trail to phone odinga to voice his support
7609852 obviously he believes that the votes were not tallied properly but what i urged was that all the leaders there regardless of their position on the election tell their supporters to stand down to desist with the violence and resolve it in a peaceful way in accordance with kenyan law
7609853 obamas advisers said the illinois senator has been working the phones for the past week to urge an end to the bloodletting he spoke to odinga for about five minutes monday before going into a rally in lebanon n h
7609854 urged an end to violence and that mr odinga sit down without preconditions with president mwai kibaki to resolve this issue peacefully
7609855 obamas campaign said the candidate had spoken to secretary of state condoleezza rice late monday about the situation in kenya the call was confirmed by the state department which provided no details because it did not want to involve rice in politics
7609856 as kenya boiled obama reached out to secretary of state condoleezza rice to discuss the situation im told it was obamas idea to put out the statement

7609859 has remained neutral in kenyan politics and did not support odinga during his trip
7609860 like many nations across this continent where kenya is failing is in its ability to create a government that is transparent and accountable one that serves its people and is free from corruption but while corruption is a problem we all share here in kenya it is a crisis a crisis thats robbing an honest people of the opportunities they have fought for the opportunity they deserve
7609861 pervasive corruption has been a major reason for disinvestments in kenya corruption and insecurity remain the major challenges for the current government
7609862 in 2007 the human rights situation was shaped by the run up to the december elections and the persistent corruption that has plagued the nation for decades action to address kenyas longstanding problems with corruption continue to be desultory

7609897 certainly biden was a big choice for obama and it does therefore force mccain to think about a big choice both in terms of debates and the potential demographic or state by state advantages in who he picks for his running mate

7609974 our position is that we are proceeding there have been no instructions from the heads of government or from the prime ministerial subcommittee on external negotiations which is chaired by jamaica that such a signing on that date ought not to take place
7609975 we believe that after three to four years of intense negotiation the option of opening up that agreement to renegotiation at this stage is just not a feasible option we doubt very much in our minds that it would be agreed to by the european commission
7609976 we were prepared to sit down and listen to the garbage coming out of europe about free trade without really examining what they were doing
7609977 if one caricom country chooses not to sign at all and they persuade the european union that they dont have the intention of signing the regulation that the european union passed on dec 20 requires that that country be taken off the list
7609978 we have always resisted this we thought that this would be problematic because theyre breaking the traditional acp solidarity that we had and you know with solidarity comes strength especially with negotiations and secondly to argue for wto compatibility for small countries developing countries in the world
7609979 this was contrary to the spirit of successive international agreements which argued that there should be special and differential treatment of these countries in international trade and economic international relations
7609980 if you combine the gdp gross domestic product of all the countries in our region it would be less than the assets of a large bank in europe so you can imagine how unbalanced how uneven the negotiations are because youre not negotiating as two equal partners they got their way because theyre essentially a bigger power and they can always threaten to cut off their markets
7609981 i for instance i am a right hander i will probably put my right hand on my heart and sign with my left hand what i am indicating by that metaphorically is that one would wish that you had a better quote unquote deal but you can manage in the circumstances
7609982 based on the advice we have been receiving from several quarters we as members of the caribbean community are now in a better position to say let us slow down a minute and engage in a further review of the real value of the epa to the region
7609983 we are to appeal to the president of france to meet with us and consider some areas of concern and see whether we can get the european community to understand and support our position
7609984 cpdc will like to reiterate its call for caribbean governments to push for the renegotiation of the agreement even at this time to correct the flaws and the contentious areas within the agreement
