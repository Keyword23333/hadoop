6930086 chaque p riode de vacances nous en ferons de m me pour un montant analogue
6930087 por que si queremos cambiar las cosas tenemos que empezar por nosotros
6930088 ya en ese momento lugo ten a claro que hab a que adecuar la doctrina a la realidad latinoamericana desde siempre estuvo comprometido con la teolog a de la liberaci n y lo demostr con su trabajo en las regiones m s pobres y en su experiencia con los abor genes guaran es
6930089 con una propuesta valiente de cambio combatir el hambre impulsar la agricultura familiar impulsar la inclusi n
6930090 porque es una manera de ver el poder por eso l debe desmantelarla y su base no ser el parlamento porque all es d bil su base ser popular all radica su fortaleza
6930091 los pueblos abor genes tienen sus propias agendas y las est n articulando con otros sectores
6930092 el cristianismo no siga destruyendo las creencias ind genas sino que debemos seguir aprendiendo y apoyando su cosmovisi n
6930093 la l gica que explota al hombre es igual a la que explota a la naturaleza e hizo hincapi en que el mandato b blico de dios no fue que el hombre dominara la tierra y sus seres sino el de
6930094 el ser humano es creado y creador dios entreg la tierra a los seres humanos como herencia para que la cuiden no para que sean dominadores
6930095 debemos aceptar la alteridad esto es el derecho del otro a estar aqu con nosotros
6930096 cu l es la novedad matiz la iglesia no estuvo siempre caritativamente atenta al sufrimiento de los pobres la diferencia capital es que el cristianismo de la liberaci n ya no considera a los pobres como simples objetos de ayuda compasi n o caridad sino como protagonistas de su propia historia art fices de su propia liberaci n
6930097 entre los pobres est el gran pobre que es el planeta tierra explotado saqueado por la voracidad del proceso industrial moderno enfatiza todos vivimos bajo un modelo de civilizaci n que explota a las personas las clases las naciones y agota los escasos recursos de la tierra por eso necesitamos una ecolog a de la liberaci n unir ecolog a f sica cu ntica discurso teol gico y espiritualidad
6930098 no s lo los pobres gritan las aguas gritan los animales gritan el planeta entero grita
6930099 que es la marca registrada de la teolog a de la liberaci n
6930100 el gran pobre que es la tierra y sus ecosistemas
6930101 por eso hablamos de una eco teolog a de la liberaci n
6930102 la visi n que los astronautas nos dan de la tierra ellos cuando ven la tierra desde afuera dicen que no hay distinci n entre la humanidad y la tierra que todo es una misma unidad el ser humano es la propia tierra que en un momento de su evoluci n empez a sentir a pensar a amar nosotros somos tierra no estamos sobre el planeta tierra somos la propia tierra que piensa que ama basta de hablar de medio ambiente hay que hablar de ambiente entero
6930103 hay una nueva conciencia del orgullo de ser se est n organizando son los primeros due os de la tierra y reclaman sus derechos imponen agendas
6930104 es que la mayor a de los medios de comunicaci n son empresas que quieren ganancias
6930105 claro que hay otros medios como las radios comunitarias la tv p blica o internet que rompen las hegemon as de los grandes medios
6930106 estamos ante una traves a desde un tipo de sociedad industrial enfrentada con la naturaleza hacia otra de inclusi n que priorice la l gica de la vida
6930107 como un proceso nico y contradictorio con caos y cosmos que a medida que se expande se vuelve m s complejo y cuanto m s complejo m s cargado de conciencia hasta llegar a la conciencia del ser humano y a la vida como autorganizaci n de la materia
6930108 debemos librarnos de una teolog a c nica a la que no le interesan los temas de la gente y abrazar la teolog a de la calle la teolog a viviente
6930109 siempre hubo pobreza pero ahora es escandalosa y visible no pueden ocultarla es subhumana
6930110 justice is our main concern after all this time we would like clarification
6930111 viewers are in for a treat in what is shaping up to be one of the most spectacular canadian idol finales ever
6930112 watching last nights canadian idol was one of the best experiences ive had at the reality show and sitting in my cushy seat amid rabid fans and blinding spotlights i rediscovered the brilliance this idol thing had when it was new and revolutionary
6930113 we are still seeking clarification about the accident from the south african authorities
6930114 cant put into words how much i will miss you you are an amazing person you will never be forgotten r i p marci xxx
6930115 i cant believe it i just cant believe it one of the nicest guys in eton will always miss you markie boy love you forever
6930116 i wont comment on anything else until i introduce our running mate to the world
6930117 i want somebody whos independent somebody who can push against my preconceived notions and challenge me so we have got a robust debate in the white house
6930118 eso s una vez que se han levantado los pisos estos se adjudican a las familias con m s necesidades a los que tienen muchos hijos a los que tienen a su cargo un familiar enfermo o personas mayores
6930119 una vez que la persona entra a vivir en el inmuelbe y s lo si es de nueva construcci n el propietario tendr que pagar el 10 de sus sueldo hasta que salde su deuda con el estado
6930120 claro es un m nimo por los costes de la construcci n
6930121 la nica opci n que se les facilita es la de la permuta de viviendas similares entre cubanos familias que deban trasladarse de residencia normalmente por motivos laborales y tengan que cambiar su casa con otra familia en su misma situaci n
6930122 el 60 de las familias pueden llegar a suma hasta cuatro generaciones conviviendo en un mismo hogal porque no tienen casa donde vivir claro eso hace que muchas parejas se planteen tener hijos ya somos el segundo pa s m s viejo de am rica latina despu s de uruguay pero se calcula que para 2025 seremos el primero y el acceso a una casa tiene mucho que ver en esto
6930123 adem s esta escasez de viviendas tambi n es una de las causas generadoras de la migraci n en masa
6930124 una persona se puede hacer muy vieja esperando que le den una casa por eso lo que est intentando la gente es no construirse una vivienda nueva porque eso es muy costoso sino acoplar habitaciones o pisos superiores a las casas que ya poseen pero incluso esto es complicado porque para poder hacerlo se necesita un permiso urban stico tiene que aprobarlo el arquitecto de la zona el abogado y nunca se podr construir nada que contraste con la imagen paisaj stica existente
6930125 si el ministerio de energ a necesita una persona para trabajar le van a ofrecer un hogar de una bolsa de viviendas destinada concretamente a estas personas que van a cuba a trabajar lo mismo pasa con los m dicos por ejemplo
6930126 es parad jico que en cuba el metro cuadrado alcance en muchas zonas a nueva york para estas personas s que existen inmobiliarias especializadas para ellos para los extranjeros pueden pagar por un piso entre 2 000 y 3 000 euros al mes de alquiler
6930127 our team has worked hard and we have enjoyed great local support
6930128 we have eight minutes to say this is london we dont want to overcomplicate to rebrand the nation or stage an opening ceremony this is a short sharp shock that fires the starting gun for london
6930129 and probably a bit of the big toes thats what worries me the big one is for balance id have to learn to walk again
6930130 i have no fever and i also have no nightmares so actually im doing fine
6930131 awful really awful painful and smells everything but hes still alive and thats the main thing
6930132 i hardly survived a big stone smashed my face and my arm people see me with a bloody face and they are shocked they think this is not just a walk in the mountains this guy is crazy then i start to explain that if you are ambitious there is a lot of risk
6930133 i had this drive to prove to all the people around me that i could do k2 that i can climb everest without oxygen that i can go to the north pole that i can survive for 80 days on the south pole
6930134 a lot of people didnt believe me maybe because of this i had this stubborn thing i will show you
6930135 but she didnt know anything about peaks it sounded romantic and there was media attention but then when it went wrong she was very scared and said i hope you never do this again
6930136 its a milestone you can say your whole life i was there when you talk about it you get this i dont know how you say it in english this shivering
6930137 and you are fighting for each other taking care of each other to survive this it gives you a soulmate the rest of your life you can always knock on the door they will always be there to help you
6930138 its always in the media when people are killed but if its a successful story nobodys interested to the summit this time it was all perfect and then all the way down its this big story because of the tragedy
6930139 people do think we are crazy but we also think a lot of people around us are spilling their lives by doing nothing my mother my father they died from cancer my mother was eaten away by this disease and for her the quantity of life was the most important thing she was 63 when she died for me its about quality maybe you dont get old but it doesnt matter to me
6930140 yes of course but you just have to put things in compartments and concentrate on the job in hand
6930141 you think fuck it is not possible because it is getting very stupid
6930142 first he slips then he tumbles over then hes gone its some kind of slow motion you think give me your hands then hes gone aaaah just like that then you realise fuck he must be dead then you see some movements on the glacier and everybody is shouting hes still alive
6930143 i thought nobody knows im here its bad weather no helicopter can get here probably i gave up i thought if i moved id fall there was no solution
6930144 it was just pure focus i was only thinking about surviving i was too busy to pray if i had prayed then it would have meant id really given up
6930145 im not sure if it was tiredness or that i lost consciousness
6930146 no i dont think so because as a mountaineer you know these things can happen
6930147 to build a farm we have just bought a farm
6930148 it was the most beautiful thing at the top youre looking over maybe 100 mountains the earth is not horizontal any more it makes a curve you see this beautiful round planet earth gerard had tears in his eyes
6930149 you see gerard standing there this huge man with a big smile on his face there was not a moment when we were thinking of tragedy everything was according to plan
6930150 one of the sherpas had reached the summit and the next day his wife gave birth and this norwegian couple is still in my mind
6930151 they were a really lovely adventurous couple and now if you know these people didnt survive why its very yah such beautiful weather everything was ok
6930152 i believed you were there to have a shower and find somewhere to sit on that occasion i admit i felt some sympathy for your position
6930153 he doesnt want to live in the streets where he will be dirty when he wakes up he knows he shouldnt go to gatwick but he did
6930154 then the martyrdom seekers of the organisation of al qaeda in britain will target all the political leaders especially tony blair and gordon brown and we will also target all embassies crusaders centers and their interests through out the country with the help of allah
6930155 sydney took the opening and closing ceremony into the air with cables beijing has demonstrated what is currently possible using lighting and visual imagery
6930156 the london olympic stadium will be the beginning of digital technology we see the stadium as the ultimate communication device
6930157 it is unlikely we will see a games of this scale and stature again it is unlikely this will be the format for the future it wont be in london
6930158 london has and will have to deliver as well as china in the welfare of the athletes
6930159 i mean the quality of the olympic village the quality of the transportation from the village to the venues the operation of the venues this has to be as good because the games are for the athletes the games are not for london the games are not for great britain the games are not for the ioc
6930160 the idea of using digital technology on the wrap of the stadium is an option that is being discussed
6930161 it is early days as we look more closely at the creative treatment of this element in 2009 and 2010 we would assess the need for the creative skills of an artist and that would have to fit in with the overall look of the games
6930162 weve now had four people shot in the back of the head this year thats a rare thing
6930163 for me thats a modus operandi it tells me that it could be the same guy or the same group
6930164 the police stations have no back up power so when the electricity goes out everything goes out the roofs leak and all our buildings have rooms that are unusable
6930165 my deputy commissioner went out on an overnight traffic patrol and found the officers werent even equipped with torches he ended up buying some from his own pocket eighteen of our 45 patrol cars are not serviceable and we need bullet proof vests and guns
6930166 its insane to expect to reform a police department when you dont give them what they need
6930167 we have a great deal of affection for our british visitors
6930168 we want to tell them this was an isolated incident and that they can still come and have a good time without being fearful
6930169 we must come together as a nation to fight crime
6930170 these are hard times and we have to move with these times
6930171 this incident is not antigua its not who we are we respect life we can have fun and we are a serious people we feel horrible this happened
6930172 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the text
6930173 were going home our mood is marvellous beautiful we came here experienced war and are going back in one piece
6930174 the only shame is we didnt make it to tbilisi
6930175 theres been no withdrawal from western georgia they are putting up checkpoints in the port of poti the ceasefire agreement clearly says that they dont have any right to block any major road or to be in major urban areas
6930176 its beautiful i feel a great weight has been lifted from my shoulders i feel free
6930177 its not about us its a celebration of visual computing
6930178 no one has ever done anything like this visual computing is exploding right now no matter where you look on a notebook pc iphone car navigation
6930179 high end amazing virtual world demos that will knock your socks off herbst said and minority report like visual displays mental images an nvidia subsidiary will also present work done in remote graphics rendering a at the intel developer forum on friday nvidia announced cuda 2 0 the second version of its programming language cuda was designed to turn the graphics processor into a programmable processor engine allowing general purpose calculations to be performed in addition to graphics rendering the latest version includes a photoshop plugin to move compute intensive functions away from the pcs cpu and onto the graphics chip the 2 0 version also supports both 32 and 64 bt windows vista and mac os x and adds support for 3d textures and hardware interpolation theme number one is graphics beyond gaming
6930180 everyone wants to play their part in making the olympics a success
6930181 the challenge now is to turn what has been two weeks of great success into 10 years of sporting triumph for our country
6930182 i will leave no stone unturned in my determination to make london 2012 a great success
6930183 thats a matter for the queen i think the country will want to see our athletes honoured and the country will want to celebrate their success and give them the permanent recognition they deserve
6930184 not content to win a silver medal in athens in 2004 she decided to change sports
6930185 with the whole world watching the olympic games have captured the imagination of the whole global community
6930186 the 2008 beijing olympics have set a new standard for the olympic games which we in london in 2012 will seek to follow
6930187 he responded by saying that these are issues that will be part of our continuing discussions
6930188 what has concerned us is the violence the disruptions that has led us to be concerned about the safety of our employees our equipment and investment and of the viability of the process
6930189 we need to protect our people how would we be able to bring our managers and their families if they are going to get beaten if anybody is under the impression that because we have made a large investment of 15bn rupees 184m we would not move then they are wrong because we would move to protect our people

6930231 the trick with wireless power is not can you do it its can you do it safely and efficiently
6930232 it turns out the human body is not affected by magnetic fields it is affected by elective fields so what we are doing is transmitting energy using the magnetic field not the electric field
6930233 initially it eliminates chargers and eventually it eliminates batteries all together
6930234 that is potentially a world changing event this is the closest weve had to something being commercially available in this class
6930235 its great that we have wireless email and wireless internet and stuff like that but at the end of the day it would be nice to have wireless recharge as well
6930236 j t osullivan will be our starting quarterback going into the season and im expecting him to succeed
6930237 im very confident j t is at the point where hes our best man for the job right now

6930262 pek moh is a good man if we need anything got no money we can always go to him and he will help us thats why he cannot go to parliament he has to stay here and take care of local matters

6930264 as the saying goes it takes a crook to catch a crook
6930265 this years march 8 elections proved something that the people do have power its given us all the confidence that we can effect change
6930266 the bn has been in power for 50 years thats enough so well give anwar his chance if anwar doesnt perform well well kick him out at the general elections in five years time
6930267 like the vast majority of both democrats and republicans when it was first implemented i did vote in favor of no child left behind
6930268 its a good example of how well intentioned legislation can go bad if not administered properly
6930269 holding schools accountable putting qualified teachers in every classroom and evaluating results are all basic components
6930270 however the way in which those results are measured the very dampening effect of lumping students with special needs in with every other test score in a way that doesnt serve the interests of either those children or the schools and the parents who are trying to measure and understand how schools are performing that is whats not working

6930274 again this number will increase as the number of suspect cases increases over the next few days as the investigation is ongoing
6930275 what well find out is whether the illness and the meat were linked if its the same strain
6930276 im glad we got hold of it early and now well take serious steps working with the feds to put it behind us

6930282 we are doing today what we have said consistently over the last few years we are constantly looking for combinations that improve cis business from a scale and distribution point of view
6930283 if the 1 5 billion figure is right it would boost tier 1 capital by about 45 basis points
6930284 more capital leverage to do something abroad scotia management have said several times they will continue to look at acquisitions and historically scotia are well known for buying assets when they were cheap
6930285 would get it a share of a more successful assent manager than they have been themselves
6930286 odds of such a deal occurring are very low ci would certainly benefit from owning and managing scotias mutual fund business
6930287 would likely be far less attractive for either sun life financial a major shareholder of ci or scotiabank
6930288 being worst in class to having a major stake in a premium asset manager

6930294 it was the producers or directors who were most likely to be arrested
6930295 theyd be charged with conspiracy to commit prostitution or conspiracy to commit oral intercourse
6930296 this guy would show up late to a set and then tell me he had to be done in an hour

6930378 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6930379 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign

6930391 im sure hell make a wonderful choice for our party and for our country and well just have to wait until next friday to find out the answer to those questions
6930392 i havent because i dont know how but my son has
6930393 i just got done with my first physical therapy session and my muscles hurt so badly
6930394 well except for the fact that im pmsing so bad ive started thinking about murder in the past ten minutes ive had homicidal thoughts about all of you
6930395 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
6930396 i live like a recluse no one knows i exist
6930397 i took comfort in the fact that perhaps one day when he was older george might want to know who his father had been and who his brothers and sisters were and if he ever came to me i would be there for him to tell him the story i knew
6930398 i have scars from defending myself with my fists i am good with my fists
6930399 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
6930400 i live like a recluse no one knows i exist
6930401 i took comfort in the fact that perhaps one day when he was older george might want to know who his father had been and who his brothers and sisters were and if he ever came to me i would be there for him to tell him the story i knew
6930402 i have scars from defending myself with my fists i am good with my fists
6930403 im upset im angry it makes me feel like a nonperson
6930404 mrs mccain was raised as the only child of jim and marguerite hensley and had no family relationship with any other sibling
6930405 the fact is my mother and cindy had lots of contact
6930406 cindy continues to make the point that shes an only child and my mother has to relive it she kathleen always wanted to have a closer relationship with her dad
6930407 its bad enough seeing these people gunning for the highest office this other business is just hurtful
6930408 few times a year i saw him at christmas and birthdays and he provided money for school clothes and he called occasionally
6930409 i fully agree with the letter that congressmen franks shadegg and flake sent to the maricopa county republican party this week
6930410 its the radiocarbon date that to our minds is like a square peg in a round hole its not fitting properly and the question is why
6930411 there is a lot of other evidence that suggests to many that the shroud is older than the radiocarbon dates allow and so further research is certainly needed
6930412 only by doing this will people be able to arrive at a coherent history of the shroud which takes into account and explains all of the available scientific and historical information
6930413 hes had other ideas but theyve all been shot down and this one will be shot down too
6930414 wheres the beef so mccain and the republicans have failed to link him to extreme liberalism radicalism rev wright or any of the identifications they have been trying to pin on the democrat both campaigns have almost totally failed to move past square one on obama
6930415 on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
6930416 by the time i met him he is a professor of education at the university of illinois we served on a board together that had republicans bankers lawyers focused on education
6930417 it is difficult to imagine a more archetypal instance of the press informing the public of government operations through government records than ostergrens posting of public records to demonstrate the lack of care being taken by the government to protect the private information of individuals
6930418 in the end it appears this law was passed not for the purpose of protecting social security numbers but to silence a critic of the states failure to protect such numbers from identity thieves
6930419 we went into the pit access area and we stood along the fence line that they had at the pit access area in hopes that cody would see carl edwards
6930420 then carl happened to be walking by and we gave him a thumbs up and cody gave him a thumbs up and he saw his flag waiving on the back of codys chair and so he stopped turned around and came back and he came over and he signed his wheelchair and he signed his shirt
6930421 he looked at him and he said hey buddy ill tell you he said if i win that trophy today now thats if i win he said ill give you that trophy
6930422 doing the best i have done in a taste of the trail
6930423 let it alone thats our class pet his name is fluffy
6930424 i sure hope notre dame has more luck than fluffy did
6930425 i just hope that lto chief suansing can back up his claims with facts because as far as i know the lto is the only government agency that sells issues and distributes all vehicle plates including security plates and protocol plates
6930426 he should name names and present proofs this is a very serious allegation and if he is claiming facts and not speculations then the house is prepared to discipline our members
6930427 and as far i know it is the lto that sells these security plates protocol plates and diplomatic plates to unauthorized vehicle owners im really glad that lto chief suansing opened this up because now we have a basis to conduct an investigation
6930428 its about keeping john mccain from sweeping the south thats the key
6930429 to beleive him not just when i accept christ as savior but every moment one moment at a time this is the christian life and this is true spirituality
6930430 i was non verbal and look where i am now
6930431 the united states i think has shown great flexibility i think the iraqis have shown great flexibility and this is an excellent will be an excellent agreement when we finally have agreement and i just want to emphasize well have agreement when we have agreement
6930432 so all of those stories and rumors that are in the newspapers about what the agreement says probably ought to be disregarded until you see a final agreement
6930433 they dont really believe that the theater missile defense components in poland and in the czech republic although they are very small are in fact in the end really intended for iran
6930434 the other piece of this is that the russians have opposed the general national military defense program of the united states for a very long time
6930435 and they put the two things together they think this is the camels nose under the tent that the united states is putting in place in alaska now in central europe and who knows where next the components of an effective for a much more extensive ballistic missile defense system that would be directed against russian nuclear capabilities
6930436 the president traveled to georgia august 13 when there was a rally in tbilisi and stood beside georgian president mikhail saakashvili and said now we see the real face of russia
6930437 here is the president of poland clearly suggesting that russia is a serious military threat to all its neighbors that is obviously going to lead to the action that its has taken that is to defend itself as best it can
6930438 the russian military actions in georgia not only broke through whatever resistance the polish government had to doing the deal without getting further satisfaction on the terms of the deal but in addition pushed both sides to build in these extra defensive measures which are clearly directed against russia
6930439 no one raises any question but that the patriot missile battery or batteries that are to be put in poland plus the joint administration and patrolling of them by both u s and polish forces is designed for russia
6930440 if the russians should do anything to attack those missiles and american lives are at risk then that would mean that the debate about whether or not the united states would actually do something to protect members of nato would become academic
6930441 and indeed because american troops were there it would serve as a trigger and the united states would react
6930442 stevens friend sold his real estate interest only six months later with an eventual gross profit to stevens of more than 100 000

6930445 his decision was ready in just two weeks he did not exert sufficient diligence to study the case
6930446 i am only proving my rights as a lawyer i am not in a case where there is a transfer of properties and i need a local court to approve my entry of appearance i have already presented all the evidence that philipps jr appointed me as their counsel
6930447 certiorari will not lie as a substitute for an appeal
6930448 this was the first day in a while that he took a step back i dont know what it was if something confused him today but we need him to be more consistent than he was today
6930449 there were a couple things but nothing that should have caused him to not be as consistent as hes been
6930450 its like a starting pitcher with a clunker i hope its an aberration and tomorrow he will get back to where hes been which is really consistent
6930451 i cant really say anything said costa the presumed starter at quarterback until he injured his
6930452 im sorry im trying to win a company email competition so im spamming everyone i know

6930455 voted for at least two pro legalization of marijuana bills
6930456 do you support keeping drug possession dealing and trafficking a crime
6930457 it appalls me at the thought that people would be na ve enough to vote for someone who admits drug use
6930458 watching parents wail and cry and talk about the hell their families went through
6930459 i would never vote for an elected official who was ever a drug user
6930460 we have to get this country back to being an honorable nation with honorable people running it
6930461 we worked long and hard to close those drug paraphernalia shops in the 1980s and long and hard again to get student drug testing in the schools so we could get drugs out of the schools
6930462 and were going to allow someone to come in to the white house of the united states of america who was a drug user
6930463 until recently he obama had the luxury of presenting his story alone
6930464 a progressive research and information center dedicated to comprehensively monitoring analyzing and correcting conservative misinformation in the united states media
6930465 we needed to play full speed tackle football and i think we scared ourselves out of playing football thursday
6930466 it will create some difficulties anytime our parents cant use the usual routes it does cause some confusion
6930467 but were very lucky here because we are able to use our church parking lot and thats what we will use as our drop off and pick up point
6930468 depending on how the construction is going we will double up our number of teacher if we go outside so that we can monitor them a little bit more closely
6930469 so we have a couple of plans that we have ready to go depending on how far the construction gets
6930470 the jazz network has been amazingly great for me and my music ive also discovered some very talented individuals here on the jazz network and reconnected with old friends and fans jaijai did an incredible thing when she created this awesome network im extremely proud to be a member of the jazz network and to turn my friends and colleagues onto it
6930471 a beautiful flower delights and refreshes the hearts of all people equally no matter what soil it grows in that is the power of beauty the same is true of great art it is this spirit that the german poet heinrich heine sang of when he wrote that once the peapod bursts open the sugar peas inside are for everyone to enjoy
6930472 it was a pleasure to be featured on the jazz network main page
6930473 you have to give credit to colorado college for being organized as a team especially in the final third of the field on offense
6930474 i am disappointed with a couple of the goals that we gave up because they were mistakes on our part we need to get more disciplined and organized on defense
6930475 this game is behind us and now we return home to prepare for next weekend we will work harder as a team and we need to improve with each and every day
6930476 the field training aspect is essential for our students because we are more than a civilian medical school or graduate school of nursing
6930477 we produce a physician but we are also producing a military medical officer that requires a lot of additional knowledge and skills that you wouldnt get in a civilian medical school
6930478 im really excited about what were getting out of this
6930479 this training defines the uniqueness of what a military medical school means
6930480 the bottom line is that we need doctors who can perform in the combat zone as well as the clinic
6930481 dont think for one minute that because you are a doctor that enemy forces are not going to shoot at you
6930482 this is not a test of infantry skills and we are not trying to develop them as infantry officers
6930483 but as we teach them the basics what we expect to challenge them with is leadership
6930484 its about leadership its about planning and organization its about communication its about situational awareness its about learning to prioritize because you never have enough resources or people and you never have enough evacuation capability
6930485 as a medical person when you see someone hurt you want to run and you want to play doctor
6930486 but as the commander you need to focus on what those responsibilities are
6930487 your job is to keep the whole machine running the medical the transportation the security the communications the logistics you have to manage people but do it without micromanaging
6930488 its my brothers and sisters in the force who really do the hard part
6930489 were here to support them the folks here all have the same call to duty
6930490 i want to be a military doctor first and foremost and this is the place to prepare for that
6930491 i chose this school because of the military medical aspect i wanted to be in a program that trained me for that and thats what im getting here
6930492 they are taking care of me and i am taking care of them they are amazing people and they deserve great care
6930493 i think this is perhaps the first time in pakistans political history where you have the will of the people prevailing over establishment institutions
6930494 you have seen that pakistans stock market has responded very positively and you have seen that the rupee has appreciated against the dollar and the restoration of judges will only improve things even further
6930495 we are very clear and consistent in our stance that general pervez musharraf should be brought into a court of law to answer for the crimes he has committed against the people of pakistan

6930511 shell be a while longer do you want to wait
6930512 ive got two tournaments going on within one thats basically what i feel like
6930513 im trying like heck to keep it out of my mind but its nearly impossible i want to make that team and i want to be on there but its hard when im thinking about that and when im trying to play golf here too i feel a little more pressure to tell you the truth
6930514 when youre coming here you dont know what to expect you dont know anything about the golf course
6930515 all of the good feelings that i had last year at westchester basically they are there but as far as it relates to the course they are gone because we are at a different venue youve just got to go around and learn this one all over again and try to gain some good positive feelings from what youve got here
6930516 i was tired i tried hard but i struggled to focus
6930517 things didnt go my way and that tends to happen when youre slightly off your game that was the story of my day i would definitely put it down to mental tiredness than anything else
6930518 theres no doubt that a couple of days rest will do me more good than playing a couple of rounds at the bottom of the field thats for sure
6930519 we were disappointed he didnt win the jim dandy but it was a good effort
6930520 when we lead him over were going to lead him over with confidence
6930521 were starting to turn some heads and teams arent looking at us like oh were just going to roll over these guys defender ryan cochrane said
6930522 we never get too high when were winning you can come crashing down in three results and we understand that
6930523 winning two in a row doesnt mean were going to run away with it he said
6930524 complement of what we already had a really solid team
6930525 i think the change in confidence is the main thing before we didnt know where the next goal was going to come from now so far it looks like weve got goals everywhere
6930526 its not a big deal but i just hope i can keep him on the grass every day hes done with dirt
6930527 if it does happen then it will be all good
6930528 because it means we would have won the breeders cup
6930529 if both horses finish the year right i dont see what the problem is then were ready

6930549 september marks the start of the normal seeding and renovation time for cool season grass species in most of north carolina a common question is whether to begin fall renovation seeding given the current environmental conditions this is especially an issue considering most of the states urban areas are under some level of drought and outdoor watering restrictions typically september seeding is desirable because night temperatures are decreasing and given adequate moisture tall fescue kentucky bluegrass and the fine fescues will germinate and grow early seeding in september is beneficial because this allows these grasses to mature in the fall and therefore going into the winter the plant is healthier there are a lot of reasons this is important
6930550 well i dont have much experience with microprocessors or electronics but i have seen name your advanced technology device and i would like to make one

6930565 how to move forward with the best interests of our country and our party guiding my way
6930566 who would have thought that obama would be in this situation less than four years into his first term as a u s senator the dude is a newbie i thought he was at least 4 and likely 8 years away from running
6930567 so if he runs the country the way he ran the campaign id say im comfortable with his qualifications as a business person im mighty impressed
6930568 his middle name is hussein and his last name rhymes with osama
6930569 and his preacher made some really bad sound bites that were played ad nauseam
6930570 and he beat the crown princess of the democratic party the guy is remarkable resume aside
6930571 except i didnt realize edwards ran on being black no wonder he lost
6930572 edwards ran on a similar message and placed third in several states
6930573 heres a crazy question i was always curious about had hillary won the nomination she would have been able to select bill her husband as her v p nominee im pretty hes eligible but had she resigned for whatever reasons would he have been able to serve out the term
6930574 no person shall be elected to the office of the president more than twice and no person who has held the office of president or acted as president for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected president shall be elected to the office of the president more than once but this article shall not apply to any person holding the office of president when this article was proposed by the congress and shall not prevent any person who may be holding the office of president or acting as president during the term within which this article becomes operative from holding the office of president or acting as president during the remainder of such term
6930575 a subsequent sampling of opinion from professors of constitutional law former white house lawyers and even a couple of federal judges reveals a simmering disagreement on whether a president who has already served two terms can be vice president some agree with the conclusion that the presidential term limit embedded in the constitution bars someone such as clinton from returning to the white house even in the no 2 slot others though call that a misreading of the literal language of the law
6930576 no person who has held the office of president or acted as president for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected president shall be elected to the office of the president more than once
6930577 she hillary clinton and her husband are incredibly divisive secretive and manipulative frankly apart from policies the clintons and the bushs are the same evil
6930578 your reason for comparing barack to george w is ludicrous

6930587 it makes no sense to tell the enemy when you plan to start withdrawing
6930588 all the terrorists would have to do is mark their calendars and gather their strength and begin plotting how to overthrow the government and take control of the country of iraq i believe setting a deadline for withdrawal would demoralize the iraqi people would encourage killers across the broader middle east and send a signal that america will not keep its commitments setting a deadline for withdrawal is setting a date for failure and that would be irresponsible
6930589 you smell so good i just want to bite the hell outta you

6930821 we believe hanafi did this because he wanted her to give him all of her assets and a divorce outside of the courts so he would not have to pay her alimony or split their assets

6930828 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6930829 to retain an unbroken presence on the newsstand for the last six years is a testimony to the dedication and hard work of all the people who work and support the magazine it seemed entirely fitting that we should therefore do something special to celebrate our 50th edition and since we have always had a top quality photography in the magazine since issue 1 producing four covers for our readers seemed particularly appropriate
6930830 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6930831 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6930832 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6930833 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6930834 if your heart was failing how far would you go to fix it

6930838 the learned panditas masters of buddhist arts and sciences write on tablets of stone all the science of our planet and of the other worlds
6930839 we have been working on this agreement for some time now and are very pleased with the results everyone here at ameriwest is extremely confident that we have acquired an excellent addition to our growing portfolio which adds significant breadth to our project mix with this agreement we add highly targeted primary recovery to our secondary recovery and exploratory efforts increase our role as operators and boost our overall position as players in the rocky mountain region the geary prospect is a natural fit for our strategic aims and we look forward to making the most of it
6930840 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6930841 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6930842 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6930843 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6930844 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6930845 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6930846 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6930847 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6930848 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6930849 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6930850 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6930851 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6930852 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6930853 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6930854 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6930855 since we acquired this title last year i have been overwhelmed by the level of reader support it has i am pleased that we have been able to have time to talk to many of the readers about what they liked and disliked and take many of their comments and suggestions on board prior to the magazines relaunch
6930856 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6930857 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6930858 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6930859 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6930860 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6930861 de hecho ese fue una de las condiciones que puse antes de aceptar que en eventos universitarios como ser la pr xima universiada nacional representar a mi escuela pero sin dejar de defender los colores de jalisco en otro tipo de eventos
6930862 me insistieron pero no quise aceptar me encanta mi estado y no pienso dejar de jugar por l
6930863 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6930864 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6930865 the magazine had a loyal readership and i am looking forward to producing a title that both satisfies them whilst opening up this subject matter to a brand new audience
6930866 theres something for every woman and thats very important to us
6930867 ive always hated when lingerie is uncomfortable so the fit and comfort was key
6930868 i come from a place where how stylish or fashionable you were had nothing to do with how much money you had
6930869 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6930870 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6930871 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6930872 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6930873 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6930874 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6930875 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6930876 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6930877 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6930878 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6930879 los que hablan no saben y los que saben no hablan
6930880 quiero a alguien capaz de retar mis ideas y no simplemente a alguien que diga que s a todo
6930881 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6930882 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6930883 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6930884 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6930885 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6930886 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6930887 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6930888 who are open to doing something on the production side
6930889 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6930890 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6930891 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6930892 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6930893 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6930894 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6930895 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6930896 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6930897 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6930898 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6930899 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6930900 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6930901 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6930902 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6930903 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6930904 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6930905 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6930906 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6930907 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6930908 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6930909 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6930910 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6930911 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6930912 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6930913 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6930914 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6930915 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6930916 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6930917 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6930918 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6930919 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6930920 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6930921 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6930922 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6930923 when you play as a striker it is always like this
6930924 when you stop playing it is difficult to come back and play again you need rhythm even more when you are a striker because you need confidence if you dont have confidence you are nothing
6930925 i dont think i am back to my best yet i am still looking to enjoy my football but i am starting to like it again because i am playing more games and the more i play the more i learn how chelsea play and i think the more i play the more confidence i will have
6930926 scolari has an unbelievable record in the world game and he has the resources available which are the envy of us all im sure hell do very well there
6930927 you cant write chelsea off when it comes to the title
6930928 demography of indigenous peoples of the arctic based on linguistic groups major groups
6930929 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6930930 one of the illusions of life is that the present hour is not the critical decisive hour write it on your heart that every day is the best day of the year
6930931 die amerikaner tun gut daran den russen weiter die teilnahme an diesem system
6930932 die amerikaner tun gut daran den russen weiter die teilnahme an diesem system anzubieten ich wei von us seite dass die t r hier nicht zugeschlagen ist
6930933 eine tiefe und ernste krise in der wir uns befinden
6930934 dass die russische f hrung direkt mit der georgischen spricht das ist gelungen aber wir m ssen noch einen sehr weiten weg gehen
6930935 basically a lot goes on in memphis a lot of us women dont tend to our health how we should ive had a couple of family members who have lost their babies it was something to do with heart failure
6930936 it will take money and support but this is a priority
6930937 the babies arise from neighborhoods with poor schools locked community centers and no supermarkets
6930938 it is important all new zealanders turn out regularly to support our democratic right to promote and foster a healthy attitude to sex and sexuality
6930939 ah god rubs face this was supposed to be a good day im sure we were all thinking that when we woke up that morning
6930940 i did this without her permission and it was wrong
6930941 this is a man obsessed with taking a woman down
6930942 shocking and shows the true lack of remorse which the judge should take into consideration at sentencing
6930943 he continues his attack on the victim with unfounded implications
6930944 larry mendte like all cbs3 employees was treated professionally and fairly during his tenure here his allegations are totally without merit
6930945 to your knowledge is everything he said accurate and correct
6930946 we will not make a specific recommendation as to what sentence the court should impose
6930947 are you pleading guilty because you are in fact guilty as charged
6930948 i do not intend to do anything at this time until i hear the judges sentence
6930949 what were going to do regarding larry and his employer
6930950 the writer of the anonymous letter had to be aware of the suggestion for community service by the district attorneys office and of lanes resistance to the suggestion
6930951 i ask that this long mutually self destructive feud now end we have both paid a high cost and others have been hurt as well i am sorry to all
6930952 the best defense against crime is law abiding citizens ready and able to defend themselves
6930953 the police cant be everywhere at once so the rest of us have to be prepared to act to stop crime thats why the school district in harrold texas deserves praise for changing its policy to allow teachers and staff to carry concealed handguns that school will be one of the safest in the country when classes restart next week
6930954 tragically former texas legislator suzanna hupp learned this lesson first hand
6930955 we need a president who will uphold and aggressively protect the right of americans to own firearms for any lawful purpose including most importantly defense of ones self and family as suzanna hupp reminds us
6930956 the u s supreme court has ruled that the second amendment protects an individual right to buy a gun but the anti gun lobby continues to fight to restrict firearm ownership barack obama long has opposed gun rights and john mccain has received only lukewarm c ratings from the national rifle association neither can be counted on to truly protect this most fundamental constitutional right
6930957 despite the success of our partnership we understand that priorities change and wish chevron owner of the texaco and havoline brands the best in implementing their new marketing initiatives
6930958 in 17 years we have never had any representative of joe gibbs racing knowingly act outside of nascars rules and that is something we consider essential to how we operate on a daily basis
6930959 what we have determined is that these individuals involved used extremely poor judgment
6930960 i encourage the local police to back up our armed forces so that not only can our armed forces wear their uniforms in public but so they should have the gratitude of the british public for the work they do
6930961 for he is not a jew who is one outwardly nor is circumcision that which is outward in the flesh but he is a jew who is one inwardly and circumcision is that of the heart in the spirit not in the letter whose praise is not from men but from god
6930962 but it is not that the word of god has taken no effect
6930963 there is neither jew nor greek there is neither slave nor free there is neither male nor female for you are all one in christ jesus
6930964 and if you are chrusts then you are abrahams seed and heirs according to the promise
6930965 after catching two or three bluegill alyssa turns to me and says papa ive got to go to the bathroom
6930966 a few minutes later the float went under and i saw the water start boiling up i knew right then that i had my hands full with that fishing rod
6930967 it wont happen until those whose crimes trepashkin was investigating are no longer in power in russia litvinenkos murder and the slow annihilation of trepashkin are just new crimes to add to their criminal record their constant denial of medical treatment for trepashkin and his suffering testify to it
6930968 continuing to wait on obama the trail vice presidential rollout has been as long as ever thanks to the medias interest and the campaigns willingness to play the game
6930969 these have been an absolutely fantastic games and theres no doubt that in terms of performance and theatre the chinese have set the bar pretty high
6930970 i am absolutely determined that we come in under the 9 3 billion i have no reason to think that we will have any difficulty in doing that
6930971 we are looking at ways of economising finding ways of moving things around perhaps but in no way do i want to prejudice the legacy value of the olympics
6930972 ensure that londons taxpayers and indeed british taxpayers do not pay a penny more
6930973 im the nominee im the nominee good christmasday to you all i believe
6930974 the premier has indicated that there is no reshuffle on the agenda
6930975 the premiers full steam ahead in ensuring the future of the states electricity supplies and the governments focused on improving services for families right across the state
6930976 the premier has indicated that there is no reshuffle on the agenda
6930977 the premiers full steam ahead in ensuring the future of the states electricity supplies and the governments focused on improving services for families right across the state
6930978 we have to bring our a game against the united states
6930979 any team who expects to beat them has to bring their a game we expect a hard physical game we hope for a great spectacle for basketball
6930980 it the foul on griffiths was outside the box i think everybody saw that was clear
6930981 i think every time we get this referee we just have a bit of bad luck you know so thats unfortunate
6930982 i wasnt in charge then since ive been in charge anyway i wont say it i wont get myself into trouble i cant afford a fine we are not allowed to say anything
6930983 i dont know where the four minutes of stoppage time came from and then he stopped time for the last minute
6930984 the players are gutted they all felt where did the four minutes come from and then it extended it felt like six minutes in the end where that came from we dont know bitterly disappointed
6930985 weve picked up a point it should have been three theres no denying that fact and i think newcastle found themselves very lucky today
6930986 realistically after the first half the game should have been dead and buried we should have capitalised on our opportunities and been more ruthless in front of goal
6930987 but it tends to be a situation that when you are not ruthless in front of goal and you dont go on with it you invite the other team back in and thats exactly what we did
6930988 we just need to have a bit more of an awareness
6930989 i thought both fullbacks were probably the poorest theyve been and we rely heavily on the fullbacks getting involved in the play and also working hard on the defensive side of things
6930990 we have to bring our a game against the united states
6930991 any team who expects to beat them has to bring their a game we expect a hard physical game we hope for a great spectacle for basketball
6930992 desde entonces hemos venido formando profesores a lo largo de estos a os 140 nuevos profesores provenientes de la zona z rate escobar baradero mashwitz y toda la zona norte y desde entonces junto con el profesorado de historia hemos ido realizando las llamadas jornadas de historia regional donde el profesorado ha presentado trabajos de investigaci n realizada en sus aulas juntamente con la presentaci n de destacados historiadores y disertantes de primer nivel
6930993 por mi parte puedo manifestar que es una enorme emoci n tomar parte en la coordinaci n y organizaci n de estas jornadas en los 25 a os del profesorado porque el orgullo de haber sido alumno de la primera promoci n del profesorado en historia haber terminado mi carrera y haber comenzado a ejercer como docente en el instituto hasta el d a de hoy y poder llegar a este aniversario del profesorado de historia es emocionante porque la carrera se inici en el 83 que como recordar n fue el a o de la vuelta a la democracia y para nosotros fue como una brisa de aire fresco un lugar donde poder pensar y sentir diferente poder expresarse en libertad y creo que es lo que estuvimos haciendo durante estos 25 a os y como dec a andrea lo que significa para nosotros desde el punto de vista institucional abrir las puertas y poder convocar a ex profesores y ex alumnos y a la comunidad toda poder compartir es una tarea importante porque trasciende a la comunidad
6930994 finalmente fue el lic oscar trujillo secretario de cultura y educaci n quien se refiri as a este acontecimiento al que nos estamos refiriendo
6930995 it the foul on griffiths was outside the box i think everybody saw that was clear
6930996 i think every time we get this referee we just have a bit of bad luck you know so thats unfortunate
6930997 i wasnt in charge then since ive been in charge anyway i wont say it i wont get myself into trouble i cant afford a fine we are not allowed to say anything

6930999 the players are gutted they all felt where did the four minutes come from and then it extended it felt like six minutes in the end where that came from we dont know bitterly disappointed
6931000 weve picked up a point it should have been three theres no denying that fact and i think newcastle found themselves very lucky today
6931001 realistically after the first half the game should have been dead and buried we should have capitalised on our opportunities and been more ruthless in front of goal
6931002 but it tends to be a situation that when you are not ruthless in front of goal and you dont go on with it you invite the other team back in and thats exactly what we did

6931072 metaphorically the criminal justice pipeline is like a slave ship transporting human cargo along interstate triangular trade routes from black and brown communities through the middle passage of police precincts holding pens detention centers and courtrooms to downstate jails or upstate prisons back to communities as unrehabilitated escapees and back to prison or jail in a vicious recidivist cycle
6931073 in a criminalized economy the risk of imprisonment is almost a form of business license tax
6931074 t he penal system can be viewed as a type of labor market institution that systematically influences mens employment and has a pervasive influence on the life chances of disadvantaged minorities

6931077 this is a very difficult time for our employees and their families
6931078 coming to this decision was arduous but necessary to ensure the fiscal health of the community development department
6931079 we had hoped that the first round of layoffs and nearly two years of cost saving measures would curb the revenue loss enough to avoid this second round of job cuts

6931081 the amount of concern and urgency from the detroit companies has increased in the last month and significantly ratcheted up what theyre communicating what their funding needs are
6931082 i believe we should fund it and take action that will assist detroit and its suppliers in making it through this difficult time of transition
6931083 its a common sense response to the realities on the ground
6931084 we dont see it as a bailout we see it as government assistance to help retooling tied to the production of these advanced technology vehicles

6931087 creo que el se or branco marinkovic ha cometido un error al hablar de federalismo cuando el sentimiento regional en santa cruz y en otros departamentos habla de autonom as
6931088 yo pregunto qui n es branco marinkovic para autonombrarse portavoz de todos los cruce os cuando ni siquiera ha sido elegido democr ticamente para esa presidencia del comit c vico pro santa cruz

6931093 quiero decirles al pueblo alte o desde esta sede sindical de los transportistas de los choferes que estamos dispuestos a prepararnos frente a estas permanentes provocaciones que si no quieren enviarnos del oriente boliviano al occidente preparados a importar carne

6931097 lifes most urgent question is what are you doing for others
6931098 si los ganaderos de beni y santa cruz quieren hacer una especie de cerco y pretenden castigar a la poblaci n pace a con la escasez de carne se equivocan pues estas medidas no tienen xito cuando se las usa en contra de los humildes pero s son una gran estrategia de lucha en contra de los opresores
6931099 entonces no se puede comparar una medida realizada contra el pueblo y esperar que tenga xito cuando son empresarios que defienden sus intereses y muestran su rabia a una poblaci n que s lo se manifest por la aprobaci n de los cambios
6931100 aqu santa cruz lo que estamos luchando y peleando y la bandera que levantamos cuando asum el comit pro santa cruz es autonom a y es lo que encaja muy bien en nuestro pa s
6931101 por eso vamos a luchar porque todo los departamentos tengan ese mismo derecho esa asimetr a permite a diferencia del federalismo que se pueda implementar en el pa s de forma muy adecuada y muy apropiada

6931107 when you come to look at major writers in the soviet union russia in the 20th century you cant ignore solzhenitsyn he creates a narrative thats difficult to ignore but even if you want to you cant not read it you have to read it even to destroy it but you cant ignore it and its very rarely that a regime especially the second largest regime in the world will be fearful of a writer and the text that they have produced are producing or which might come out so thats the way that for me at least solzhenitsyn appears as a substantial and subversive figure and a danger to an empire

6931129 this project isnt about a big street resurfacing like the one on lake street
6931130 were looking at low cost high impact improvements things like painting intersections and crosswalks or putting out planters
6931131 we put up two kiosks on franklin to keep people up to date on whats been happening
6931132 one of the very explicit things that came out was improving between cedar avenue and the hiawatha lrt
6931133 all the indicators that make it our way make it seem like theyre in crisis mode
6931134 the fact that we are looking to out of the state agencies with these few days to go tells me that the ball was dropped

6931136 this celebration has two patron saints connected to it st martin de porres and st frances cabrini

6931160 if you noticed all the nice looking expensive cups were taken up leaving behind the plain and cheap ones while it is normal for you to want only the best for yourselves that is the source of your problems and stress
6931161 be assured that the cup itself adds no quality to the coffee in most cases its just more expensive and in some cases even hides what we drink what all of you really wanted was coffee not the cup but you consciously went for the best cups amp and then began eyeing each others cups
6931162 now consider this life is the coffee the jobs houses cars things money and position in society are the cups they are just used to hold and contain life the type of cup we have does not define nor change the quality of life we live sometimes by concentrating only on the cup we fail to enjoy the coffee god has provided us

6931164 disposable income growth has been eroded by high consumer price inflation and the emergence of weakness in the labour market mainly emanating from declining construction employment but also reflecting a more generalised weakness in labour demand
6931165 the bottom line is that the irish economic picture continues to deteriorate and with consumers clearly retrenching we strongly believe that the government should be looking at providing fiscal stimulus tax cuts in the december budget to alleviate the pain on the hard pressed personal sector
6931166 what is clear from the figures is that the consumer strike that began in april has continued
6931167 given the uncertain economic climate people are naturally becoming more cautious postponing any discretionary large scale purchases
6931168 these trees are a valuable asset to the entire city
6931169 it was very laborious and it made me extremely irritated because i knew that left and right people were cutting them at night or whenever
6931170 i dont think thats a reason to do it but i understand why people would
6931171 i dont think people understand the value of trees thats the main problem
6931172 its important that people have a respect and understanding of how the trees are contributing to us otherwise were going to continue to have these problems

6931174 in the world that i study everybodys trying to kill the biofilm
6931175 but theres not a concrete answer for that and thats why you need to understand methods
6931176 thats why we can be one of the few labs in the world that can focus on methods development
6931177 every time a person buys a product with an epa approved efficacy claim such as kills 99 percent of bacteria the public trusts the validity of the process used to prove that claim
6931178 our goal is to grow bacteria in a way thats relevant to how the bacteria exist where the product is used
6931179 that way we can have more confidence in the products actual effectiveness and so can the public
6931180 so many results depend on the process a person uses
6931181 to have only one way to grow a biofilm isnt going to cut it

6931185 the team have one boxer in the final and have also gained two bronze medals which is the best result since 1956 even so there are people in armchairs trying to tell me my job there is tremendous spirit and we will go forward to 2012 with the same fight that has been shown here the team have done themselves proud but they must have the support of everyone throughout the sport that would be nice
6931186 my performances have shown a steady improvement and what i think i proved today is that i have got on top of the tactics i need to win here my tactics are in great shape and so is my head
6931187 i feel as if all the hard work has gone down the pan with that performance i thought he would box off the back foot but instead he came at me from the off

6931216 but it should also have some meaning behind it and not just be some pretty eye candy that made me think of the seal of rassilon but since it makes an appearance on the next page it shouldnt be the actual seal and celtic knot work wouldnt really work but i wanted something like that elaborate and a little complex like the trouble hes in

6931219 when i was six i lived in finland for about a year and what television there was and of those the ones in english were all itv shows the phoenix and the carpet the muppets toms mindnight garden i claudius and grange hill they were all shows i enjoyed and they had a really specific look about them we later moved to toronto and i remember my aunt watching this show on tvontario that had that look there was a guy in a crazy long scarf and a girl dressed like andy pandy running around a nuclear power plant as a disembodied rock hand growled eldrad must live and it scared me silly i was hooked
6931220 i love the new stories like i loved those old fourth doctor ones especially with tennant who captures the doctors personality so beautifully that manic enthusiasm
6931221 but now theres the added bonus of seeing it from an adult perspective theres more of an appreciation for the story probably the best way to put it baker is the doctor of my childhood but tennant is my doctor today
6931222 there are a bunch of stories percolating in my head that id like to write
6931223 if i had a banner id hold it in the morning all over this land
6931224 mengapa pembahasan ini hanya ditujukan kepada wanita adalah karena memang semua audiencenya adalah akhwat wanita
6931225 when the internet first appeared this heated debate developed among economists
6931226 one side said the internet will make it easier for companies to price discriminate and itll be fabulously profitable the other side argued that the internet will be the great make markets close to perfectly competitive and people much more price sensitive and profits will be highly constrained im probably the leading guy associated with that second position arguably i got lucky but what i wrote basically turned out to be correct
6931227 if someone could have gone back and told people then how many phone lines would exist today in the u s theyd have responded that that was physically impossible because every american would need to be a telephone exchange operator that few switchboard operators exist today nevertheless isnt a sign that all those people are unemployed the labor economist alan krueger at princeton has studied what share of the highest paying occupations are occupation codes that didnt exist in the 1980 census the figure is very substantial theres always job churn
6931228 we are asking for federal officials to investigate the homicides of two young men we believe the evidence to be overwhelming that the perpetrator was drunk when he broadsided their car at 2 49 am thanksgiving day
6931229 the cook county states attorneys office has for reasons unknown to the family or to the public refused to fully investigate this crime
6931230 we believe that evidence was withheld and testimony may have been perjured by the cook county states attorneys office and chicago police officials during a preliminary hearing before a judge who ruled that charges of felony dui should be dismissed
6931231 therefore we have no choice but to ask that the u s attorney look into the original crime as well as the investigation of the crime so that we can have justice for the victims their families and the residents of cook county

6931233 gives a new perspective on the english civil war through the eyes of angelica fanshawe riseborough who is drawn to the anti monarchist cause at a time when england executed its king in favor of an alternative form of government
6931234 considering the british traditions of free speech and the individual and the british suspicion of organized crowds we would want to avoid the leni riefenstahl connotations which were there in beijing and the ceremony was too long
6931235 i never want to be pigeon holed im an entertainer whether im entertaining a teenage girl whos watching me judging on a tv show a young guy watching doctor who or a couple watching torchwood the fact i can diversify is great

6931241 these have been an absolutely fantastic games and theres no doubt that in terms of performance and theatre the chinese have set the bar pretty high
6931242 but i think with british ingenuity wit and all the rest of it resourcefulness we are going to produce a games an opening ceremony a closing ceremony and all the stuff in between that is going to be in our own sweet way just as fantastic
6931243 i am absolutely determined that we come in under the 9 3 billion i have no reason to think that we will have any difficulty in doing that

6931250 after more than a quarter century in washington d c out of touch dick durbin just figured out that amtrak is unable to handle the growing demand for rail use in illinois
6931251 increasing demand for rail didnt happen overnight amtraks fleet didnt age overnight the degradation of illinois manufacturing base through over regulation and a runaway tort system didnt occur overnight all of this however did occur on dick durbins watch
6931252 dick durbin was unable to provide solutions that would have allowed us to avoid the current energy crisis we are facing indeed at every opportunity dick durbin stood in the way of expanded domestic drilling and enhanced reliance on nuclear power
6931253 now it is clear that despite years of talking about the need to improve mass transit dick durbin failed to find legislative solutions that would have prepared our rail system to handle the pressure of increased ridership caused by the energy crisis he helped create
6931254 dick durbin says he would like to revive train car manufacturing in illinois
6931255 unfortunately dick durbin and his democratic colleagues in springfield and washington are responsible for creating an environment that has devastated our manufacturing base
6931256 instead of more empty election year promises dr sauerberg will deliver results
6931257 dr sauerberg knows that to revive train manufacturing in illinois we need to create an environment that will encourage investment and entrepreneurship we need to dramatically streamline bureaucratic red tape that is choking out business in illinois we need to fundamentally reform our runaway tort system that has been fueled by unscrupulous trial lawyers finally dr sauerberg knows that we need real tax reform we need to cut taxes on individuals and companies that are willing to help re build our manufacturing base

6931268 in martial arts it is important that strategy be unfathomable that form be concealed and that movements be unexpected so that preparedness against them be impossible only the formless cannot be affected sages hide in unfathomablility so their feelings cannot be observed they operate in formlessness so their lines cannot be crossed

6931274 this is why high walls and deep moats do not guarantee security while strong armor and effective weapons do not guarantee strength if opponents want to hold firm attack where they are unprepared if opponents want to establish a battlefront appear where they do not expect you

6931587 it must have been a close call for the commission
6931588 ten years ago the merger between westpac and st george was unthinkable the recent tightening in financial markets has strengthened the relative position of the banks vis a vis non bank competitors and means that any increase in banking concentration needs close scrutiny
6931589 of all the mergers approved in my time the bank of melbourne was the most unpopular with consumers people would stop me at parties and complain about it
6931590 the treasurer is responsible for maintaining meaningful competition in the banking sector and there is no point in bank customers being able to switch banks if there are fewer banks to switch to

6931592 in a very different way from prior mergers within australia

6931598 harnads suggestion is that the universities transfer the payments they are currently making to their academic presses to subsidize peer review and archiving of their faculty scholarly output
6931599 u niversities increasingly expect their presses to be self sustaining economically and are unlikely to put up the necessary funding
6931600 extra funding by whom for whom for for what while universities are subscribing to journals that pays for peer review if and when journal subscriptions collapse the university savings will pay for the peer review and again this has nothing to do with university presses in particular
6931601 n ot all scholars and nonprofit publishers are connected to universities who will subvene their publications
6931602 unaffiliated scholars are rare enough and the per paper costs of peer review alone are low enough so that a small surcharge on the charges of the affiliated authors the vast majority will take care of these outliers
6931603 oa has different implications for the humanities and social sciences

6931616 its just that well ive always been afraid that you might get recalled to earth because the military has a ridiculous amount of say over your life and i mean look what happened to sam they dont even tell her whats going down until she returns to earth and then they blindsided her with it and there was always the possibility someone would find out about us

6931622 well okay its a series of alternate realities so everything we experience there would feel very real to us because it would actually be happening to us but think about it we could live out our lives in peace and contentment or we might never age at all we could die in one reality and live on in a thousand others we could have all the adventures in the universe and when we were tired of that we could retire here in atlantis all our enemies defeated or we could settle down in some house on the beach somewhere get a few cats maybe a dog
6931623 is that i havent yet figured out how to make sure in all realities that youre mine i mean i could have used some more time to work on that another year would have been nice not to say that the realities in which you are paired with someone else dont have the potential for incendiary hotness but just the same

6931629 without a stay harrison will face the ramifications of a sex offense allegation in this case and it will impact his ability to seek gainful employment at a later date
6931630 to force registration at this point arguably thwarts the intent of this courts suspension of the execution of harrisons sentence
6931631 it is a transparent attempt that the auglaize county prosecutors office is making to prevent mr harrison from seeking any form of redress from a court with competent jurisdiction on the registration issue
6931632 mr harrisons registration requirements and any actions to force his relocation given the proximity of his home to a school or such other building should be stayed pending further action of this honorable court
6931633 over the past two years corn has been blamed for a lot of things weve been running the gamut and its been fun

6931684 the war on the theory of evolution and on its proponents most often originates in forms of religious extremism which are closely allied to extreme right wing political movements
6931685 to firmly oppose the teaching of creationism as a scientific discipline on an equal footing with the theory of evolution and in general resist presentation of creationist ideas in any discipline other than religion
6931686 from previous correspondence i am sure you could clearly deduce that the position of the education division is perfectly aligned to the council of europe resolution 1580 since it was made amply clear that while every school is obliged by law to follow the national minimum curriculum in all curricular matters religious moral and ethical instruction is imparted in respect to the freedom of belief as guaranteed by the constitution and in the light of the right of every parent of a minor to give his decision with regard to any matter concerning the education which the minor is to receive as entrenched in article 6 of the education act

6931709 i started recycling as soon as i moved to castlefields because the recycling banks were really close to home and right next to the shops
6931710 it became a regular trip to head to the recycling bank and i actually felt a little sad when the councils new system came in and boxes were delivered to the house
6931711 i still planned on carrying out my regular recycling system after picking up norman but i had no idea that he would soon be aiding me in my green intentions
6931712 on my first trip to the bank i took a longer route to let norman stretch his legs and noticed somewhere along the way he had picked up a plastic bottle of his own
6931713 i assumed he thought it was a toy and would be looking for me to play but he followed me to the recycling bin and dropped his bottle at my feet
6931714 i thought it was brilliant when he picked it up in his mouth crushed it as everyone is asked to do and took it to the recycling bank
6931715 i love the fact that now if i have one too many bottles to carry i have a little helper and if i dont need any help he finds bottles that others have failed to put in the bin and makes sure they end up where they should

6931730 senator mccain has stubbornly focused on maintaining an indefinite us presence in iraq but events have made his bluster and record increasingly out of touch with reality
6931731 while senator mccain continues to offer unconditional military and economic support for iraq i strongly believe that we need to use our leverage with the iraqi government to ensure a political settlement
6931732 i am glad the administration has finally shifted to accepting a timetable for the removal of our combat troops from iraq
6931733 success in iraq depends on an iraqi government that is reconciling its differences and taking responsibility for its future and a timetable is the best way to press the iraqis to do just that
6931734 i welcome the growing convergence around this pragmatic and responsible position
6931735 he is going to say finally we are to the place where we are going to do what i have been calling for ever since we got in and that is to get out

6931789 the senator mccain is being touted by the media as a man of principle yet he was involved with other women while married to his first wife and was implicated in the so called keating scandal with four other senators he was eventually reprimanded by the congress for the appearance of impropriety the senator reportedly has a violent temper and can be extremely confrontational and profane when angry these red flags about senator mccains character are reminiscent of the man who now occupies the white house

6931843 no para nada seguramente que ellos entrenaron hicieron alguna actividad pero eso no afecta en nada el rendimiento de ellos ni va a ser un pretexto para que no haya un buen partido
6931844 lo mas incre ble es que siempre se ha sabido que la continuidad ofrece resultados sin embargo muy pocas instituciones asumen esa pol tica pues eso implica muchas responsabilidades entonces una cosa es que la continuidad se planee que se diga y otra que se haga creo que mucha gente lo sabe pero muy pocos lo sostienen
6931845 gushing over flowery tablecloths and playing at being mother with the teapot ignores the reality of this period that many women felt forced to stay at home and performed these chores not with delight but in a fit of frustration for many feminists then there is something almost perverse about actively choosing to do tasks that the womens libbers of the 1960s and 1970s fought so hard to reject
6931846 we cant operate a plant with police protection if that is the way it is before we start then what would happen when we operate

6931898 were glad that the republican convention is being held in the state where the modern ethanol movement was launched

6931924 it hasnt really been an issue so far because ive never had any major illness or injury or prescriptions that i have to pay a bunch of money for or anything like that
6931925 i did have health insurance when i was going to school but i stopped going to the u about a year ago now
6931926 a students private health insurance information is subject to periodic audits providing inaccurate or false information may result in unexpected charges and is a violation of the student conduct code
6931927 we get better rates overall by having a mandatory insurance plan
6931928 you have to weigh individual benefits versus community benefits its best for the entire community because we can keep the rates low
6931929 even if people think theyre invulnerable they still need insurance students say they cant afford it but by not having insurance they could end up in bankruptcy
6931930 right now the federal government isnt doing much to address this problem
6931931 our healthcare system is built with holes in it and we need to fix it
6931932 after i graduate hopefully i will find a job that will give me health insurance

6931947 i can genuinely say i did not feel a sense of nervousness that we had to follow that because london brings other things and it will be a different place and a different time
6931948 we will take a london approach and will be different our approach is to keep it simple and creative to make it youthful and diverse entertaining and fun
6931949 we are not going to win over everybody but it is something that will appeal both to younger generations and to more mature generations such as myself

6931954 i ran out of breath after my celebration but truly the most important thing is we did this as a group throughout the year weve had our ups and downs but it took all 19 of us to get the job done
6931955 especially for girls to have somebody in your town that grew up here and went through soccer programs here
6931956 she actually dedicated a jersey to the us at the store and signed her jersey
6931957 all the indicators that make it our way make it seem like theyre in crisis mode
6931958 the fact that we are looking to out of the state agencies with these few days to go tells me that the ball was dropped
6931959 youre not going to see anybody in a uniform at the xcel energy center
6931960 this celebration has two patron saints connected to it st martin de porres and st frances cabrini
6931961 de porres is the saint of social justice and mother cabrini is the saint of immigrants we wish to honor their spirit of justice by sharing our stories making the connection between the struggle for justice both inside and outside the faith community

6931963 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6931964 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
6931965 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6931966 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6931967 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6931968 im sure hell make a wonderful choice for our party and for our country and well just have to wait until next friday to find out the answer to those questions
6931969 i want to tell you of an incident of washingtons life one which no one alive knows of except myself and if you live you will before long see it verified
6931970 from the opening of the revolution we experienced all phases of fortune now good and now ill one time victorious and another conquered
6931971 one day i remember it well the chilly winds whistled through the leafless trees though the sky was cloudless and the sun shone brightly he remained in his quarters nearly all the afternoon alone
6931972 i do not know whether it is owing to the anxiety of my mind or what but this afternoon as i was sitting at this table engaged in preparing a dispatch something seemed to disturb me
6931973 presently i heard a voice saying son of the republic look and learn while at the same time my visitor extended her arm eastwardly
6931974 at that moment i beheld a dark shadowy being like an angel floating in mid air between europe and america dipping water out of the ocean in the hollow of each hand
6931975 a second time the angel dipped water from the ocean and sprinkled it out as before
6931976 at this the dark shadowy angel turned his face southward and from africa i saw an ill omened spectre approach our land
6931977 and again i heard the mysterious voice saying son of the republic look and learn
6931978 instantly a light as of a thousand suns shone down from above me and pierced and broke into fragments the dark cloud which enveloped america
6931979 then once more i beheld the villages towns and cities springing up where i had seen them before while the bright angel planting the azure standard he had brought in the midst of them cried with a loud voice while the stars remain and the heavens send down dew upon the earth so long shall the union last
6931980 the scene instantly began to fade and dissolve and i at last saw nothing but the rising curling vapor i at first beheld this also disappearing i found myself once more gazing upon the mysterious visitor who in the same voice i had heard before said son of the republic what you have seen is thus interpreted three great perils will come upon the republic the most fearful is the third passing which the whole world united shall not prevail against her let every child of the republic learn to live for his god his land and the union with these words the vision vanished and i started from my seat and felt that i had seen a vision wherein had been shown me the birth progress and destiny of the united states
6931981 were the words i heard from general washingtons own lips and america will do well to profit by them
6931982 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
6931983 i think if it ever came before the supreme court wed get a very definitive opinion that this is not appropriate
6931984 the president is then directing the agency how to act and unless there comes time that the issue is then confrontable by congress or the courts he can go on directing this sort of behavior indefinitely
6931985 its yet another hard hitting congressional report with no teeth to it
6931986 unless they find a case specifically that can go to the courts youre never going to have a judicial determination
6931987 george bush came to town promising to change the culture of washington
6931988 we have documented many cases where the u s has been very happy to let other countries hold these people indefinitely
6931989 to either languish at egyptian prisons or to request your extradition to the u s how much of that is justice and how much of it is politics how is it possible for me under the current circumstances to face up to such challenges alone unaided and unprotected
6931990 i think mohamed youssef is suffering now more than anyone in the case
6931991 everything thats going on with him has everything to do with this indictment
6931992 my brother had the islamic fundamentalist look were not islamic fundamentalists
6931993 this is a police country if you say anything against the government if you are gathering and you discuss political things you get arrested
6931994 i have already reached the front line why should i return
6931995 years ago you were free to go wherever you want after sept 11 everything changed
6931996 try to think of us as human beings my brother mohamed and me were very good people
6931997 our last kick in the b town for the summer
6931998 our last kick in the b town for the summer
6931999 as animals are considered objects in china there is little or no awareness for the suffering of these sentient beings
6932000 the cruelty found was beyond our expectations and it was hard to document without interfering it caused nightmares to the team especially in the editing room because the scenes had to be replayed and replayed to be edited from six hours down to 20 minutes
6932001 our main goal was to get this distributed because we want consumers worldwide to be aware about the cruelty involved in the fur fashion
6932002 people have a right to know that a huge percentage of fur is imported from china which doesnt have any federal laws protecting animals on fur farms people who might contribute to this atrocity by purchasing fur or fur trimmed garments need to know about the horrible suffering of the animals who wore that skin first
6932003 we want them to see how fur farmers slam terrified animals including raccoon pups on the ground and skin them while theyre still conscious people need to know what theyre really buying when they buy fur or fur trim
6932004 conditions on chinese fur farms make a mockery of the most elementary animal welfare standards
6932005 this report shows that chinas colossal fur industry routinely subjects animals to housing husbandry transport and slaughter practices that are unacceptable from a veterinary animal welfare and moral point of view
6932006 they struggle and try to fight back to the very end even after their skin has been stripped off breathing heart beat directional body and eyelid movements were evident for five to 10 minutes
6932007 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
6932008 we have reached a stage at which we have surrounded ourselves with more things but have less joy
6932009 nothing the great mystery placed in the land of the indian pleased the white man and nothing escaped his transforming hand
6932010 but because for the lakota there was no wilderness because nature was not dangerous but hospitable not forbidding but friendly lakota philosophy was healthy free from fear and dogmatism
6932011 in sharing in loving all and everything one people naturally found a due portion of the thing they sought while in fearing the other found need of conquest
6932012 for one man the world was full of beauty for the other it was a place of sin and ugliness to be endured until he went to another world there to become a creature of wings half man and half bird
6932013 forever one man directed his mystery to change the world he had made forever this man pleaded with him to chastise his wicked ones and forever he implored his god to send his light to earth small wonder this man could not understand the other
6932014 but the old lakota was wise he knew that mans heart away from nature becomes hard he knew that lack of respect for growing living things soon led to lack of respect for humans too so he kept his children close to natures softening influence
6932015 they say every rock pile out there he built by hand
6932016 i was 12 or 13 when i started going to the ranch
6932017 independent evidence disclosing that plaintiffs have been surveilled and a rich lode of disclosure to support their claims
6932018 are frequently used by violent protester s to plan direct actions against conventioneers
6932019 are used to blockade sidewalks streets and can be used to slow down responding emergency vehicles
6932020 in light of the spy files case five years ago this document is unnecessarily provocative
6932021 it exaggerates the specter of violent protesters it gets police officers amped up with adrenaline presenting them with the image of bomb throwing bolsheviks on bicycles
6932022 past practices of demonstrators show that they will use outlying abandoned buildings homes camping facilities secluded woods and farm fields to store their supplies
6932023 but all first responders need to be alert for medium and large numbers of these items that seem out of place for its location
6932024 a cousin of mine who is a contractor brought over a truckload of bricks that were left over from a job
6932025 we didnt know about the bulletin which had been released the day before the police visit but now it seems very unlikely that any of our neighbors called
6932026 it appears that the denver police intelligence unit is at it once again
6932027 we want to know what is going on with collecting this information and who will receive this information we have learned that all too often the collecting of this information is then classified under potential domestic terrorism
6932028 the information isnt verified the center operates secretly and involves the military which is a violation of law
6932029 in whatever place you enter a house stay there till you depart from that place and whoever will not receive you nor hear you when you depart from there shake off the dust under your feet as a testimony against them assuredly i say to you it will be more tolerable for sodom and gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city
6932030 i hope that the russian authorities will rethink their decision to reduce or worse suspend their collaboration with nato
6932031 our last kick in the b town for the summer
6932032 takes a surprising turn away from what the conservative press would expect from head and his spiritual awakening and takes an in your face gritty but very honest look at the depths to which individuals will go to satisfy their drug alcohol addictions or other vices wrapped with footage of real life stories and overlayed with other innuendo heads performance steals the picture and will answer anyones questions as to whether he can still rock as hard or harder than his earlier days in korn the literal message in the final screen will get viewers thinking long and hard about any pre conceived judgments they have about those in society typically viewed as losers
6932033 save me from myself how i found god quit korn kicked drugs and lived to tell my story

6932037 no matter where you stand on this issue its impossible to look at what has happened over the last three or four days and say this is a settled question
6932038 its also impossible to say the public isnt ready to participate in the debate the presidents are calling for
6932039 we welcome an honest discussion and that begins with a clear discussion of the science
6932040 were not burying our head and trying to hide behind laws
6932041 were trying to say what is the best way to approach this issue
6932042 whether the style of behavior demonstrated by a university president or a professor at a dinner or reception will be replicated by freshmen let loose at their first friday night keg party
6932043 why permit 18 year olds to vote but not drink
6932044 because they have not shown a disproportionate tendency to abuse the franchise to the peril of innocent bystanders
6932045 its hard to believe that the current drinking age is to blame it does limit the ways colleges can respond
6932046 the only educational message colleges can deliver to students is dont its worth considering ways to teach young people how to drink responsibly for example by letting states create limited provisional rights
6932047 im tony this wench is mine isnt she a real sweetheart
6932048 i havent seen anything like her in the market for quite a while where did you get her from
6932049 from the hands of the e amp l guys those bustards they would have wasted her the day i went there they had her hanging from the ceiling her hands tied behind the back and drawn up and all that and they tied a cement block to her big toes man it looked like they were going to break her arms and ruin her for good when i got there they had a pair of damn big alligator clamps on her nipples they wired them up and a guy was giving her electric shocks through the tits the poor babe was jerking like a fish out of water man you never heard a girl screaming like that
6932050 it turned out some big brothel wanted to buy her and they were only softening her up for the johns damn fools i told them they were ruining genuine crystal to make a piece of glass and i told them the best thing they could do by beating her up was to turn her into a bitch just like those
6932051 yeah i could see at the first sight this babe was something special high class stuff you know what i mean she deserves better than that so i made them a better offer and took her home i trained her myself it didnt take too much hard work shes a real good girl arent you sweetie
6932052 world famous russian dog wizard vladae roytapel moves to marketwatch
6932053 why i accepted and then declined an invitation to pray at the dnc
6932054 during this political process my desire is to keep an open dialogue with both campaigns and talk about the issues that matter to my generation of christians if my praying on opening night at the dnc would be perceived as showing favoritism or incorrectly labeling me as endorsing one candidate over the other rather than being the bridge building gesture which i intended it to be then i needed to rethink the decision

6932056 i hope he really does rot in hell i hope he dies a horrible death
6932057 from the moment last thursday when donnette was struck down scores of new yorkers pulled together as one to try to save her and her still unborn child
6932058 the bystanders who heroically rescued donnette from under a school bus in the bronx didnt just lift five tons 4 5 metric tons of glass and steel they also lifted the spirits of our entire city
6932059 she never got to see our baby but she was in love with him
6932060 we regret the passing of little sean michael who was delivered by a miracle and by the help of new yorkers
6932061 we hoped the babys life would have been spared now the father is left with just memories of his wife and child
6932062 we believe hanafi did this because he wanted her to give him all of her assets and a divorce outside of the courts so he would not have to pay her alimony or split their assets
6932063 this is unheard of three ships in one day the situation appears to be getting worse unless the international community do something fast
6932064 most times for younger players and for some older players the scout division is a hard thing but this speaks volumes as to how these young kids are and their willingness to help the team
6932065 we just simply posted a two deep and posted the scouts the players knew that they were coming to contribute to the team any way that they could as was presented to them in their recruitment i kind of put that to the test today it looks like we are making progress
6932066 if anybody is under the impression that because we have made this large investment of about 15 billion rupees about 345 million we would not move they are wrong
6932067 there is a definite concern of being where we are not wanted and there is a definite concern about being where people are suspicious of our motives
6932068 it was the center of heavy engineering in the past but it had disappeared from the industrial scene
6932069 so we decided to locate the small car factory in calcutta
6932070 i couldnt afford to live in bath and basically wasnt welcome there so i went back home to make a decision about what to do next
6932071 to be honest it gave me the kick up the arse i needed
6932072 thats his big weapon and he doesnt have it so he is in the bullpen
6932073 skips got a job to do and has to make the best decision for the team
6932074 he cant feel good about putting me out there with what happened in texas i dont feel good about going out with what happened in texas
6932075 as we speak today the answer is 100 percent no
6932076 its not the right thing to do and general manager dave dombrowski agrees with it
6932077 sure 90 of science fiction is crud thats because 90 of everything is crud
6932078 in any contest between power and patience bet on patience
6932079 every time we run out on the field and put on the geelong jumper youd like to think you could make a statement not only to the opposition but to your teammates
6932080 our form has been good but weve just got to keep continuing it on because theres two games left before finals
6932081 we dont want to concede to many sides 100 points
6932082 this time around well be obviously trying to restrict their entries as well as their end goals
6932083 well spend a bit more time on him because hes been in red hot form and whoever goes to him will have a tough job to do for the team on the day to try and quell his influence
6932084 hes kicking goals setting up goals and getting possessions so hes obviously one weve got to try and stop
6932085 hes a great team player a workhorse hes invaluable to our side so im sure our boys will try to get over the line as we try to do for most milestone games
6932086 you only have to look at his preliminary final his effort got us into the grand final

6932089 life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in an attractive and well preserved body
6932090 its a confidential deal and the buyer wants anonymity but i can tell you it is not mr trump and its not john mccain
6932091 his illegal operation included drug manufacturers couriers money launderers and accountants and he and his cohorts resorted to bribery kidnapping torture and even murder to further their goal of making as much money as possible
6932092 barack obama is guilty of it whether its him or his campaign people all that talk about how he looks different is typically done to make him a victim i think thats wrong
6932093 i think the intent on obamas part was to use a little humor to try to make a point that being different sometimes is viewed as a liability when its really an asset
6932094 he did open the door but i dont think he was trying to make that an issue thats the last thing that obama needs to do is to come out and remind people that im black if anything he needs to do the very opposite im american and to stick with that
6932095 look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
6932096 i really dont think race is being injected in the campaign at all and im really glad that its not
6932097 i think the people who are injecting it are the ones who have to fill a 24 hour news cycle
6932098 now would be a good time for that winning streak
6932099 that american military would ship munitions disguised as medical supplies and told us that u s army medics would take the red cross off their various uniform parts in order to not be hit by them thar gawdless damn gook snipers
6932100 in the 90 minutes we played we had a great deal of possession and we actually created chances but we failed to capitalize and were never able to convert 1 0 into two or three nil
6932101 with the absence of our reasonably competitive 10 man freshman class this was an opportunity for several players to stake their claim in the playing rotation unfortunately that really didnt happen
6932102 i thought our two center backs edwards and clark were fantastic competitors and along with mike drozd who spent two years watching they deserved a clean sheet

6932134 seventy six people all civilians and most of them women and children were martyred during the operation by coalition forces in shindand district of herat province
6932135 19 women seven men and the rest children all under 15 years of age
6932136 it lengthened the posting language but theres no legal substantive difference
6932137 i wanted to make sure that the discussion is not about the process but the merits or lack of merits of the charter amendment
6932138 i felt like process and ballot language was what we wouldve been talking about otherwise
6932139 it was a compromise although it was under severe duress and time constraints
6932140 when i bought the first one my husband who is not a beach person said oh this is such a waste of money the kids will never go
6932141 then it got to the point where they used it so much i couldnt get in the place so i bought another one
6932142 a veritable bling master worthy of an mtv cribs episode those televised tours of brazenly gilded homes led by celebrity owners like 50 cent hulk hogan and bow wow

6932144 generation but not quite children of the new millennium generation
6932145 because so many of us remain home well into their mid twenties right at the time that our own parents the baby boomers are needing more care
6932146 is more open to sexual expression experimentation and romantic life styles than prior generations but with less or even totally without romance or attachments
6932147 was revolutionized and got its biggest economic boost in popularity among women and because we are more sexually active it has also lead to a more active awareness of our bodies ie gay men and their hiv aids status

6932151 what does blood by his nose have to do with a cold
6932152 it was nice for him to come over and let us know what was going on but he did not have to say that in front of you
6932153 isnt that a card with a piece of t shirt worn by comedy genius and all around great guy rob schneider
6932154 oh excuse me i did not mean to trip over you you see i am blind and could not see you
6932155 that is quite ok as i am blind too and did not see you coming as well
6932156 why i do not know could you possibly help me find out
6932157 well you are soft and fuzzy with long silky ears and have a puffy little tail and a twitchy little nose i think you are a bunny rabbit
6932158 im now convinced that a large segment of the charismatic church will follow the anti christ when he shows up because they have no discernment
6932159 keep your eye on that building itll be coming down soon
6932160 bananas gift of two ugh cherries fresh 2 metal coat hangers made by me
6932161 and im alive and i dont need a witness to know that i survived im not looking for forgiveness i just need light i need light in the dark as i search for the resolution
6932162 it should be in every rucksack for those times when soldiers need spiritual energy
6932163 in the process of securing comments for recommending the book i believe there was a basic misunderstanding on my part that the comments were publishable
6932164 were intended for me personally rather than for the general public
6932165 and unless someone like military com notes it we would not be aware of it
6932166 we dont get the stateside papers in baghdad and i doubt very much that gen petraeus goes to amazon com much if at all
6932167 mrff is now officially putting both army chaplain lt col bill mccoy and general petraeus on notice not to destroy any of the written or electronic records of their communications about this issue
6932168 general petraeus has by his own hand become a quintessential poster child of this fundamentalist christian religious predation via his unadulterated and shocking public endorsement of a book touting both christian supremacy and exceptionalism
6932169 he should still be relieved of duty and court martialed
6932170 so the icece would support what general patreaus has done
6932171 agenda to be more important than the units agenda and thus lead to unit failure
6932172 no one else has written a book which allows for varying world views and perspectives while suggesting the gospel might have an idea worth considering under orders does just that
6932173 tira forte il vento forse cambia niente forse cambia tutto sembra aria bella fresca
6932174 if someone in the investigation changed the guns then there is another force behind the scenes
6932175 its because of you we are watching this look at it
6932176 those who have recently accepted christianity show increasing devotion to their own rules
6932177 i am of the opinion this will be combined with
6932178 gymnastics federation asking china for more proof about age of gymnasts
6932179 was asked to provide additional documents proving that five of the six members of its gold medal womens gymnastics team were old enough to compete in the beijing olympics in hopes it will end persistent questions about the girls ages
6932180 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6932181 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6932182 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6932183 the chinese government and the chinese athletes must be respected
6932184 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6932185 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
6932186 so we have sent a letter to the ioc and to the international federation asking them to review the matter and see if they cant resolve it for the good of the competition the integrity of the competition and the good of all the athletes
6932187 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6932188 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6932189 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition
6932190 questions on rituals adherence to god followers and anything related to your divine mission
6932191 normal for christians to have an ethical interpretation of current events and politics
6932192 unjustified and an infringement of the right to circulate news within ones own religious community a right guaranteed under our federal constitution article 11
6932193 christians believe that all of life in its political economic social cultural and religious aspects come under the sovereignty of god
6932194 interpretation of what constitutes religious matters should be left to the leaders and adherents of the faith
6932195 is not in a position to dictate to catholics the scope of their religion
6932196 im really turned on by fat out of work guys who live with their parents
6932197 a writer who has no purpose is like a traveler without a destination
6932198 the greatest benefit of learning to write is developing as a human being the writing process forces us to explore the world to enhance our capacity to think feel and perceive
6932199 refrain from organizing and joining illegal gatherings and refrain from receiving donations sermons and preaching from overseas religious organizations and groups that have a purpose

6932201 evidencia desconocimiento sobre proyectos de medios a menos que su dependencia a otros intereses lo llevaran a hacer esta cr tica infundada y calumniosa

6932204 c mo se atreve un hoy sabemos seudoexperto en comunicaciones a escribir lo siguiente entonces se coment que algo tuvo que ver la llamada pareja presidencial en la operaci n sin exhibir ni media prueba de su dicho
6932205 tambi n le dec a que el mismo olegario v zquez ra a y quien reci n incursiona como empresario de medios igualmente no ha cejado en su intento de ir por el canal 40 con el apoyo de martha sahag n
6932206 muy buena ventana para aquellos que visualizaron el canal 40
6932207 a prop sito aunque la suspensi n decretada por las autoridades aeron uticas de los estados unidos parece la puntilla para aerocalifornia m s de alguna voz asegura que el golpe inicial contra la firma a rea propiedad de ra l ar chiga tendr a por objeto ahorcarla para impedir ejercer sus derechos como concesionaria de una frecuencia de televisi n abierta estamos hablando del canal 28 cuya programaci n la llena la exhibici n de viejas series extranjeras la intenci n del due o de aerocalifornia era lanzar la frecuencia en los pr ximos meses con programaci n propia
6932208 de manera subrepticia y a pesar que existe una nueva ley y un nuevo rgano regulador que buscan la transparencia en las concesiones de radio y televisi n el grupo imagen propiedad de olegario v zquez ra a adquiri por 80 millones de d lares la frecuencia xhrae canal 28 concesionada hace m s de diez a os al empresario ra l ar chiga due o tambi n de aerocalifornia la expansi n de las empresas de v zquez ra a ha ido de la mano con su cercan a hacia marta sahag n de fox

6932210 se ha se alado que el crecimiento del grupo particularmente en la divisi n de medios se dio al amparo de marta sahag n y vicente fox cu l es su opini n al respecto
6932211 tambi n otra locura producto de la envidia todas y cada una de las concesiones de radio y tv las compramos a particulares pagando la cantidad pactada en cada operaci n
6932212 el esfuerzo m s importante que se ha realizado para terminar con el duopolio televisivo en nuestro pa s
6932213 this is a case of conversion from christianity to islam so we can say there is pressure especially from fundamentalist groups
6932214 they are giving them misinformation regarding their parents saying if you return to your parents they will kill you
6932215 it will not be fruitful for us because saba herself has claimed she is married
6932216 she has attained the age of puberty and is claiming to have married by her own choice she has also claimed she is 17 years old she will likely be given custody to her muslim husband
6932217 the one thing that unites all human beings regardless of age gender religion economic status or ethnic background is that deep down inside we all believe that we are above average drivers
6932218 we have to bring our a game against the united states
6932219 any team who expects to beat them has to bring their a game we expect a hard physical game we hope for a great spectacle for basketball
6932220 no its not that way those monkeys they were jumping too high they were jumping like this

6932226 you have to stop putting yourself through this kind of pain kyoko chan youre only going to get your heart broken
6932227 why is it that no matter how much somebody tried to make me feel better it only makes me feel worse
6932228 you obviously werent his type kyoko chan but that doesnt mean youre not somebody elses type
6932229 hai yeah like whose who would want a girl thats not stick thin who would want somebody like me

6932234 whatever else history may say about me when im gone i hope it will record that i appealed to your best hopes not your worst fears to your confidence rather than your doubts my dream is that you will travel the road ahead with libertys lamp guiding your steps and opportunitys arm steadying your way
6932235 i leave you hoping that the lamp of liberty will burn in your bosoms until there shall no longer be a doubt that all men are created free and equal
6932236 demi allah belum pernah aku melihat wajah secantik dan secerah wanita itu tidak lain kerana itu pasti kerana tidak pernah risau dan bersedih hati
6932237 apakah katamu hai saudaraku demi allah aku tetap terbelenggu oleh perasaan dukacita dan luka hati kerana risau dan seorang pun yang menyekutuinya aku dalam hal ini
6932238 pada suatu hari ketika suamiku sedang menyembelih kambing korban dan pada aku mempunyai dua orang anak yang sudah boleh bermain dan yang satu masih menyusu dan ketika aku bangun untuk membuat makanan tiba tiba anakku yang agak besar berkata pada adiknya

6932297 this weekend because of obamas attribution to her of the words
6932298 neither clintonian obfuscation nor media vitriol can stop obama he will be on his way to victory and more importantly to building a real mandate one that will finally force washington to fix americas broken trade policy
6932299 obama is wrong to quote clinton as using words she never uttered
6932300 we didnt get everything we should have got out of it in my opinion i think the nafta agreement was flawed the problem is we have to go back and figure out how we are going to fix that
6932301 we have been subject to constant attack from the clinton campaign except for when we were down 20 points and that was true in iowa it was true in south carolina it was true in wisconsin and it is true now

6932311 you remember the now historic interview i had with barrack we got along swimmingly
6932312 you dont think he would have called you by now
6932313 im sure hes very busy who else would barack pick as vp do you think he wants don lewis to win

6932352 artigas y san mart n y el proyecto del siglo xxi
6932353 we hear many reports about proposed tourist developments around the coastline some estimates are that 45 of the country has been sold off in various forms to developers mainly coastal areas and islands
6932354 evictions in cambodia are frequently carried out violently with no regard to the human rights of those affected and in violation of cambodian law military police are often used even though this is illegal very often those evicted in fact have legal rights to the land under the 2001 land law but this is ignored by a corrupt judiciary and government
6932355 the community is living along the road adjacent to their old land under tarpaulins in conditions resembling an idp internally displaced person camp the land has been fenced off but remains unused
6932356 virtually all cambodias accessible and sandy coast was in private hands either cambodian or foreign those who lived or worked there were turfed out some jailed others beaten virtually all denied meaningful compensation the deals went unannounced no tenders or plans were ever officially published all that was known was that more than 1 000m in foreign finance found its way into the country in 2007 a 1 500 increase over the previous four years
6932357 although cambodia has ratified the major international human rights treaties there is currently no law regulating eviction here
6932358 domestic laws are in any case frequently ignored by government police and courts to push through development projects including tourist development
6932359 everyone can see the potential for cambodia to develop a stronger tourist industry however it is essential that this doesnt happen at the expense of the housing and land rights of local communities current signs are not good
6932360 all applications to buy land are carefully scrutinised by the cambodian investment board which is committed to ensuring that the rights of the cambodian people are not infringed
6932361 is that the international cooperation tends to focus on lengthy drafting processes for laws and by laws and programs et cetera that are so rarely implemented on the ground that it is hard to avoid the inference that they are little more than a diversion
6932362 meanwhile development is clearly going on but taking place in a manner that tends to be to the detriment of all but the rich and connected
6932363 the world bank has pointed out that other countries in the region such as vietnam have managed to achieve equitable growth in a manner that benefits society as a whole and contributes to a far more sustainable form of stability than the cpps mix of repressive political tactics and short sighted economic rapaciousness
6932364 retribution often means that we eventually do to ourselves what we have done unto others
6932365 it is hard to compete at an olympic level when you do not get any support from the government
6932366 we need to improve and reform several sectors in cambodias education programs
6932367 part of this improvement should be in sports education which is an important part of the personal development of young people who are the future of our nation people have the tendency to forget cambodia is a nation on the rise and need to give it some time to grow
6932368 if we could get sponsored we could go somewhere with sports in cambodia but the government is not going to support us because they are busy with other things
6932369 i work really hard but do not even have the basic things i need like nutritious food to eat or clothes for training
6932370 the government needs to reform sports and give it a more reliable structure
6932371 from supporting the training and finances of an olympic athlete to building industrial parks and helping cambodia become a leading rice exporter we want to invest in areas that cambodians take pride in
6932372 the next five years will be the time investment takes off in cambodia and the country starts to put itself on the map
6932373 you will see a major change in the country and things like sports which have been overlooked because of the lack of government support may start to receive some funding from the private sector
6932374 i would not have gotten a good education if it had not been for the foreigners who came to my village and started a school
6932375 the days of the khmer rouge are over now and the youth in cambodia face different challenges like how to become socially conscious and have a voice in the development of their country
6932376 cambodia is not competitive in sports education or most jobs right now because we dont have any competition and little opportunity in the country
6932377 but i think with the right support this could change
6932378 i lived in cambodia for five years in the early 90s
6932379 the city has transformed with buildings paved roads and soon skyscrapers but what has not changed that much are the schools i would like to know how much investment is going back in to education
6932380 for example as investors build more hotels in the country others may start to invest in hotel management schools and language schools cambodia will gradually produce more skilled english speaking workers
6932381 being an athlete and just trying to live in cambodia is not easy
6932382 but i think in several years it could get better
6932383 the important thing is not to win but to take part
6932384 instead of complaining about where cambodia is we need to have a collective vision for where the country is going lets meet up again eight years from now and see where cambodia and her athletes are

6932396 the center of fay is expected to continue crossing the northern florida peninsula tonight and then move near or over the florida panhandle on saturday
6932397 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage

6932400 the two markets that were operating in theyre obviously two very different markets today
6932401 i think we are fortunate that two thirds of franchise now sit in colorado which continues to perform very well by almost all measures as one of the top five states in the country today as far as economic activity
6932402 the arizona economy on the other side of the coin is having some difficulty they continue to have job losses in arizona primarily in the construction sector but nevertheless there are some different job losses down there and some real estate depreciation obviously in that on the positive side they do continue to have in migration but probably not at the same pace that they had over the last five years in that but over time we think that the area of the arizona market will resolve itself its just a matter what period that thats going to take and my guess is it for the outskirts of phoenix its going to take three to five years in many cases before some of that market becomes healthy again
6932403 were not anticipating a provision as large as the first half of the year and obviously that may change but today as we look at things in where it seems like things are stabilizing in our arizona portfolio and that were looking for a reduced reduced levels on the provision itself
6932404 provides up to 25 million of junior secured debt financing with 10 million made immediately available
6932405 no portion of the debt facility is convertible into equity and only the first tranche of 10 million is accompanied with an equity warrant component
6932406 the terms of this agreement are far superior to those available in either the equity market or the convertible debt market unlike a market priced convertible debt transaction that would have resulted in a sizable amount of dilution to existing equity holders this agreement is structured as a more traditional debt financing that includes a small equity warrant feature
6932407 a lovely partner because they stepped up when we needed them to the most
6932408 we would have taken significant dilution in any private investment in public equity structure especially with a declining price a significant dilution in any convert ible debt structure

6932443 i predict future happiness for americans if they can prevent the government from wasting the labors of the people under the pretense of taking care of them
6932444 the cost of funds in international markets where we raise about a third of our capital is still rising
6932445 if that trend continues and some of our domestic funding costs also rise as we expect then we will not be able to pass on any or all of further rba cuts indeed it is possible that our mortgage rates may start rising even as the cash rate is falling
6932446 people say why cant you just take less profit and give people cheaper mortgages
6932447 but if we did the international credit rating agencies would look at our margins being squeezed and our profits falling and would probably reduce our aa credit rating which in turn would mean wed have to pay more for our funds then wed have to raise mortgage rates again anyway
6932448 our focus has to be on maintaining that financial stability especially in such uncertain times that means our focus has to be on our own costs not on what the rba does if that means that we have to ignore rba cuts then so be it it will be to everybodys benefit in the end
6932449 if the rba was cutting rates and the banks were going in the opposite direction the rba will cut its cash rate to help bring average rates down
6932450 a set of causes probably came together to cause the accident
6932451 a problem with a temperature sensor may not matter at all or it can be very important depending on what other circumstances accompany it

6932469 consumers like suvs they havent fallen out of love with the things that made them popular but its just become an issue of economics when you look at paying several hundred dollars a month more in fuel that becomes a big deal for most households
6932470 you pay for the car just once but you go to the pump every week so that almost seems more important to you every time you go to the pump you just want to feel good about it
6932471 when the game started i was completely nervous but as the game went on i felt more comfortable with things
6932472 its not every day that you play your first college soccer game let alone at a division i school like colorado overall though i think i got my first game jitters out of my system
6932473 this is a girl russell who scored a goal in her last high school game which was a state championship and last club game which was a national championship
6932474 having an athlete with the talent and knowledge of how to win can only make this team more dangerous
6932475 we are just getting used to each other and how some of the new girls play but overall everything was good we only allowed one shot in the second half and if we can keep playing defense at this level we are going to record a lot of shutouts this season
6932476 its just so nice to play so close to home with my family watching
6932477 my mom was in the stands today but my dad is still over in iraq so he couldnt make it today but he will be excited to watch the game online the fact that i scored today only makes it that much more special
6932478 we have got to score the easy ones whether it is against our next opponents a week from now or a month from now
6932479 its one thing to play a double overtime game and have a weeks rest and its another to do it with only a days rest our players are in good hands though with our training staff and should be ready to go against denver on sunday
6932480 given all the other economic worries we have right now the aaa believes the price of self serve regular gasoline will need to drop back to 3 per gallon before we can expect a meaningful upturn in miles driven and fuel consumption
6932481 it really makes little sense to try to upgrade our infrastructure using a revenue source as ineffective unsustainable and unpopular as the fuel tax
6932482 its down more than that maybe its down by 3 4 big difference when you are talking about big numbers
6932483 unfortunately for consumers the global industry has the ability to react to lower demand by curtailing output of both oil and gasoline
6932484 while constantly deepening economic reform and achieving sound and fast economic and social development we will continue to pursue comprehensive reforms including reforms of the political system
6932485 the 2008 beijing games have put an end once and for all to the notion that these olympics are a force for good
6932486 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
6932487 the leadership will be happy with the olympics and not just the gold medals but the performance of the people im optimistic that the values and tolerance learned during the olympics and the earthquake in sichuan will continue
6932488 the fact we are first in the gold medal table makes the world pay attention to china every chinese is very happy and proud the olympics forces china to be on the international stage
6932489 the olympics has been a great opportunity for china to learn some international things for example that audiences should not cheer tennis players as theyre about to serve
6932490 people who won bronze or silver or even no medals such as liu xiang or some athletes who could not compete because of their injuries or other reasons are all heroes
6932491 hola a todos hoy tengo buenas noticias puedo anunciar que tom y yo estamos esperando un bebe y somos muy felices
6932492 probablemente la gente no pens que tal lejos llegar a ser capaz de hacer lo que siempre he querido hacer en toda mi vida es un regalo y mi sue o se ha hecho realidad ver d nde estoy donde estuve es realmente una locura
6932493 no se puede creer cada rumor todo el mundo en disney channel realmente te incentiva la gente trata de ponerme en contra de miley pero ella me envi un texto de cuatro p ginas diciendo que ella sabe c mo es la fama abrumadora por ahora y que quiere ayudar
6932494 en casi cada escena que hicimos selena dir a dios mio estamos en el rodaje de una pel cula ahora mismo nos conocimos el d a en que comenzamos a trabajar en nuestras carreras por lo que es bastante ir nico c mo terminan las cosas
6932495 im absolutely determined to make sure that we come in under 9 3 billion
6932496 i think with british ingenuity and all the rest of it resourcefulness we are going to produce a games which is going to be in our own sweet way just as fantastic
6932497 were looking now at ways of economising finding ways of moving things around perhaps but in no way do i want to prejudice the legacy value of the olympic site and were not going to do that
6932498 may have left us less able to connect the dots than we were before
6932499 if actually deployed will leave our country more vulnerable than the existing yet flawed system today
6932500 it became abundantly clear to me that if the lee network was going to accomplish its goals setting new and higher standards for feature dancing that an office in l a with partners who share my vision was going to be absolutely necessary
6932501 in l a direct models and lisa anns talent management i found exactly what i was looking for people dedicated to the business of making performers career dreams come true
6932502 la direct models has worked cooperatively and well with lee network for many years we are delighted to cement that relationship in an even stronger manner formally partnering with the lee network and lisa ann talent management to create what we believe will be without question the industry leader in the provision of feature dancer talent
6932503 there has been no degradation in the capability to access manage and share terrorist information
6932504 its been seven years since 9 11 and we appear to be no better prepared no better able to connect the dots than we were seven years ago
6932505 its like having a dictionary without it being in alphabetical order
6932506 the information may be there you just cant find it
6932507 representative millers subcommittee has had no interaction with the nctc or the intelligence community on the railhead program
6932508 this incident occurred prior to the canada wide recall of certain maple leaf products
6932509 this does show us that what advocacy groups dont like is enforcement of the law
6932510 i think we learned that the most effective means of restoring integrity to the nations immigration system and to make this country safe from vulnerabilities is enforcement of immigration laws
6932511 to call the effort halfhearted would give ice half a heart too much credit
6932512 it was never anything more than a public relations ploy so that ice could say in the end gosh we tried but no one turned up
6932513 we came outside and we saw flames coming out of the house we went to look and it started exploding even more
6932514 when we were surveying the top officials at different universities we asked them to nominate schools that they thought were making good improvements and offering innovative approaches to college education
6932515 and riverside got enough nominations to be placed on the list this year
6932516 all my career ive sort of thought of uc riverside as being oh thats that little bitty school out there in the uc system
6932517 i came and took a look and i met the faculty and i said holy camoly man this place is much much stronger than it is perceived outside
6932518 perceptions trail reality by at least 10 years and i think this university is just about to burst onto the national radar screen as being a very very good place to go to school i think youre going to see a lot happen over the next five years
6932519 very welcome news and very confirming i think of what the university is all about these days
6932520 when i was being recruited for the position of chancellor what really attracted me so many things but one of them was the fact that this is an up and coming place i think the word innovation is a word that gets used a lot but in this case its an absolutely precise word about all aspects of the institutions activities
6932521 we basically wanted to get the word out that there are some excellent schools that offer opportunities to kids who maybe didnt score that high on the sat or may have done not so well on a couple of classes in high school
6932522 we take great pride in the fact that were ranked in that category because we dont focus as much on the inputs that the students bring with them when they show up on campus
6932523 were more about the outcomes that they take away from redlands when they graduate four years later were really focused on what the transformation has been because of the redlands experience
6932524 i think i had the experience a lot of freshmen have that everyone around you is overwhelmingly smart
6932525 i feel im paying less there than i would if i went to a uc school because of the financial support they give you
6932526 it does seem like a lot when you first find out how much it is annually but once you factor in all the financial aid that they offer its actually very affordable
6932527 it gives them some publicity ucrs kind of a smaller school so at least it helps get the name out
6932528 its good they need the press and everything else trying to get a medical school and a law school over there so its probably helping out
6932529 we view the rankings as one of the tools that many families use to help decide which colleges their students will attend
6932530 keep track of how others view california baptist university in the highly competitive higher education marketplace
6932531 its a confidential deal and the buyer wants anonymity but i can tell you it is not mr trump and its not john mccain
6932532 police now consider him to be a witness not a suspect
6932533 we are fully cooperating with local authorities on this investigation and suspects are innocent until proven guilty
6932534 why on earth would anybody be interested in anything i have to say
6932535 no youre the wrong person go to the other haunted house
6932536 the car will mostly be in a friends garage the whole time
6932537 oh well we cant really go through florida without seeing the space flight stuff can we
6932538 we could just take a little detour here and see blue ridge mountain
6932539 if i do not receive a copy of the letter requested above canceling the contract by friday june 13 i promise you as god is my witness that i will locate you in pittsburgh pa a fairly easy thing to do these days and murder in cold blood you and any employees who happen to be present in the office when i arrive
6932540 its called on the road its by this guy called jack ker oww ak and its basically about traveling and drinking

6932543 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6932544 im sorry but you cant sell any of those books

6932546 you may only open this book after 5pm on wednesdays
6932547 there has been a lot of fluctuation in the price but what has to be seen are the trends
6932548 in opec we have to evaluate if this is becoming a downward trend in order to make a decision about production that is our proposal but we have to consider it there in opec
6932549 nobody is thinking about adding new production to the market
6932550 we will launch a news channel film and music channel in bhojpuri simultaneously within three to six months time if a 66 million tamil population in the country can command 16 language channels a 150 million bhojpuri population obviously deserves its own set of channels from our research and understanding we have learnt that there is a strong demand for bhojpuri content
6932551 of the total ad space booked 75 are national advertisers like tata motors and idea while 25 are regional advertisers

6932553 a man who beyond the age of 26 finds himself on a bus can count himself as a failure

6932566 even if your outcasts are at the ends of the world from there the lord your god will gather you from there he will fetch you and the lord your god will bring you to the land that your fathers possessed and you shall possess it and he will make you more prosperous and more numerous than your fathers
6932567 we need a place where people can have a discussion and get information
6932568 and people need to know that its not coming from an anti mormon place or a gay castro district place its coming from a faithful place
6932569 when i heard and saw the letter that the church leaders had read in sacrament meetings i was appalled
6932570 so i said thats it i want mormons to know that there are gay people in their congregations every sunday
6932571 i really just want people to try and understand and see the pain they are causing gay members of the church who are struggling
6932572 provide license to infringe or impose upon the rights and liberties of others
6932573 if there would have been a site like this it would have been really helpful
6932574 last time during prop 22 all i did was vote no this time i wanted to stand up and be heard even though its hard
6932575 there is a lot of anxiety and stress over being conflicted being an active mormon and being for gay marriage
6932576 thats part of the reason we wanted to do the site
6932577 if you think you are the only person in your ward that feels that way and the rhetoric is really loud its painful
6932578 the church of course recognizes and accepts that some among its very large membership may view the issue differently
6932579 if lebanon becomes a hezbollah state then we wont have any restrictions in this regard
6932580 to hear what israeli officials say one would think israel was showering lebanon with roses during its last aggression
6932581 music i grew up with that taught me stuff about life
6932582 he punches me first and his friend who had nothing to do with it punches me
6932583 one of the stupidest things i ever did in my life
6932584 there are very few studies that show long term use is either safe or effective
6932585 anyone even a teenager the problem becomes worse it all starts with the dr which is connected to the small un heard of pharmacies then you find a bottle fo 180
6932586 so and so said so and so has a drug problem
6932587 but legislation to establish a prescription drug monitor has failed for seven years according to the governors office of drug control
6932588 i hope he really does rot in hell i hope he dies a horrible death
6932589 she never got to see our baby but she was in love with him
6932590 but if thats what the people want im not going to waste a bunch of time and fight it
6932591 he said are you working do you need a ride and she was like no and he pulled out the gun and shot her in the chest
6932592 as long as i committed a crime in their presence their trust went up
6932593 whether the kid is disabled or unruly or just being a hormonal teenager the state is saying hey we have a really easy option for you
6932594 if we save one child from being abused its well well worth it
6932595 the main interest i have is that it gives the mother or a parent another option of what to do with a child before they do something drastic
6932596 circumvents every rational practice in child welfare that im aware of
6932597 drafters will sometimes try to say as little as possible so they dont create ambiguity but drafters here succeeded in writing the law in such a limited fashion that the entire provision is ambiguous
6932598 we need a place where people can have a discussion and get information
6932599 and people need to know that its not coming from an anti mormon place or a gay castro district place its coming from a faithful place
6932600 when i heard and saw the letter that the church leaders had read in sacrament meetings i was appalled
6932601 so i said thats it i want mormons to know that there are gay people in their congregations every sunday

6932609 the church of course recognizes and accepts that some among its very large membership may view the issue differently
6932610 i should actually thank the government for helping me get my eye for an eye by showing you the evidence that youve seen the videos
6932611 helping me to take away your heart and your innocence
6932612 thats what they have done and i should thank them but i wont
6932613 my murdered molested son should have had the same rights as a living victim
6932614 ive had too much focus on keeping my family together and protecting my daughter fighting cancer for the last few years but now that this appears to be close to over im going to work on changing that
6932615 you know what lets just leave the whole military record thing alone
6932616 some of us were just as stunned as many of his supporters seem to be
6932617 it was a pretty gutsy move on his part and it really rubs the mccain campaigns face in this celebrity nonsense theyre trying to float that response ad that she came up with on her own was priceless
6932618 i guarantee you that im aware of all the houses i own and the cars that i drive
6932619 about media freedom and the right to protest were an illusion
6932620 we have documented many cases where the u s has been very happy to let other countries hold these people indefinitely
6932621 to either languish at egyptian prisons or to request your extradition to the u s how much of that is justice and how much of it is politics how is it possible for me under the current circumstances to face up to such challenges alone unaided and unprotected
6932622 i think mohamed youssef is suffering now more than anyone in the case
6932623 everything thats going on with him has everything to do with this indictment
6932624 my brother had the islamic fundamentalist look were not islamic fundamentalists
6932625 this is a police country if you say anything against the government if you are gathering and you discuss political things you get arrested
6932626 i have already reached the front line why should i return
6932627 years ago you were free to go wherever you want after sept 11 everything changed
6932628 try to think of us as human beings my brother mohamed and me were very good people
6932629 it is difficult to imagine a more archetypal instance of the press informing the public of government operations through government records than ostergrens posting of public records to demonstrate the lack of care being taken by the government to protect the private information of individuals
6932630 in the end it appears this law was passed not for the purpose of protecting social security numbers but to silence a critic of the states failure to protect such numbers from identity thieves
6932631 i told you she was good sure hope e remembers us little folks when she makes it big time
6932632 theyre just having a hard time getting a handle on it because its so dry and so steep and rocky theres no way they can put a good line around it
6932633 the results of the survey demonstrate that women understand the importance of a healthy smile but worryingly they are not prepared to spend the time and money looking after their teeth fear of the dentist is an age old problem 24 are not willing to undergo corrective treatment based on fear but new treatments such as invisalign which is a non invasive procedure using a series of clear plastic aligners to straighten your teeth have been popular as they are discreet and because they are removable patients can brush and floss as normal invisalign gives me the chance to straighten teeth but without many of the treatment barriers that cause my patients to shy away from with traditional metal dental braces the cost for treatment is a lifetime investment so when you compare this to how much women spend on beauty treatments it is minimal
6932634 we have nothing but big fights left for the rest of the year but this is so crazy because there are so many of them
6932635 were going to have a retreat on monday to figure this all out
6932636 he might not be on that card though but i really dont know for sure now but im thinking hes not going to be on that at this point

6932640 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
6932641 of course the dinoceros existed as fenech pronounces the word it is mentioned in the book of job they were used to help build the pyramids

6932662 no se dejen enga ar por todo lo que dicen sobre la guerra de clases nosotros lo que queremos es hacer que la econom a sea justa para que todo el mundo tenga una oportunidad no s lo algunas personas
6932663 una persona rica es aquella que tiene 5 millones o m s
6932664 ni obama ni mccain tienen la econom a como un tema suyo porque realmente jam s estuvieron enfocados en ella de una manera que las familias de clase obrera pudieran identificarse
6932665 obama siempre ha hablado de la esperanza y el cambio en un sentido amplio mientras que mccain ha hablado siempre de pol tica exterior y experiencia
6932666 no era porque fuera perezosa era porque era madre soltera que estaba trabajando e iba a la escuela al mismo tiempo tratando de criar a dos ni os tratando de conseguir una vida mejor para s misma y para su familia
6932667 uncle sam is not very bright but at least he has very deep pockets and a printing press in the basement
6932668 economists who now see american troubles spreading around the world are predicting that foreign central banks will ignore the gathering inflation threat and follow the fed down the rate cutting path similarly they argue that since the downturn began here the u s recovery will likely be underway while the rest of world is still decelerating these assumptions have prompted a rally in the dollar a sell off in gold commodities and foreign stocks and have cast doubts on the ability of foreign economies to decouple from the united states investors should not take the bait
6932669 in short the availability of money the increase in the money supply must come first if you are going to get systemic inflation in prices and not the other way around which you would think some hotshot economist from new york university would know
6932670 the arrogant folly of the architects of u s post cold war policy is today on display by bringing three ex soviet republics into nato we have moved the u s red line for war from the elbe almost to within artillery range of the old leningrad

6932681 the commander in chief and those under him authorized a systematic regime of torture the only question that remains to be answered is whether those who ordered the use of torture will be held to account
6932682 the ranking members of the senate and house intelligence committees were briefed dozens of times about the cias interrogation and detention program over the past seven years so any member who has held one of those posts including speaker pelosi would find it very hard at this point to point the finger at the white house without also implicating themselves

6932685 obviously designers and engineers will be thinking of their buildings as they consider our report and theyll take appropriate action

6932700 the ranking members of the senate and house intelligence committees were briefed dozens of times about the cias interrogation and detention program over the past seven years so any member who has held one of those posts including speaker pelosi would find it very hard at this point to point the finger at the white house without also implicating themselves

6932702 i wish that there would be a peer review of this
6932703 i think all the records that nist has assembled should be archived i would really like to see someone else take a look at what theyve done both structurally and from a fire point of view i think the official conclusion that nist arrived at is questionable
6932704 photos of the steel evidence about how the buildings collapsed the unexplainable collapse of wtc 7 evidence of thermite in the debris as well as several other red flags are quite troubling indications of well planned and controlled demolition
6932705 why would all 47 stories of wtc 7 fall straight down to the ground in about seven seconds it was not struck by any aircraft or engulfed in any fire an independent investigation is justified for all three collapses including the surviving steel samples and the composition of the dust
6932706 wtc 7 building could not have collapsed as a result of internal fire and external debris no plane hit this building this is the only case of a steel frame building collapsing through fire in the world the fire on this building was small amp localized therefore what is the cause

6932744 i was born in the city of angels in the late 1940s down on hope street near pershing square and cliftons cafeteria and the pantry and all them old strip joints on fifth and main you know tonight white fury and her twin 44s charles bukowski territory beat outsider american and the sound thats been lost from that time taken off the radios you had to have been there the backdrop is mcarthur park and hollywood court apartments and racetracks the old america where music still resonated through night clubs people gambled and drank and screwed and smoked people went down to the border and sipped highballs and cocktails and went to the bullfights the old america where the big guilt and political correctness and the chain stores hadnt sunk in so deep

6932750 we are a small rural district in the bible belt with strong christian beliefs and feel like homosexuality is wrong
6932751 i dont think we are that different from a lot of districts at least in the panhandle that have beliefs that maybe are different from societal changes
6932752 davis embarked on what can only be characterized as a witch hunt to identify students who were homosexual and their supporters further adding fuel to the fire
6932753 he went so far as to lift the shirts of female students to insure the letters gp or the words gay pride were not written on their bodies
6932754 i just felt like i had to stand up for the kids heather wanted to do this and i had to back her
6932755 i think a shirt that says i support gays is very different from a shirt that says gays are going to hell
6932756 one can be very disruptive for a childs self esteem the other supports other people and their ideas
6932757 what happens when these kids get out in the real world after they leave ponce de leon and they have a black homosexual supervisor at their job
6932758 i emphasize that daviss personal and religious views about homosexuality are not issues in this case indeed daviss opinions and views are consistent with the beliefs of many in holmes county in florida and in the country
6932759 where davis went wrong was when he endeavored to silence the opinions of his dissenters
6932760 david davis is a fine man and good principal and we are a gentle peaceful christian family oriented community
6932761 but i think thats less of an issue here than in miami or minnesota

6932764 the thing i hate the most about advertising is that it attracts all the bright creative and ambitious young people leaving us mainly with the slow and self obsessed to become our artists modern art is a disaster area never in the field of human history has so much been used by so many to say so little
6932765 i have no interest in ever coming out im just trying to make the pictures look good im not into trying to make myself look good and besides its a pretty safe bet that the reality of me would be a crushing disappointment to a couple of 15 year old kids out there

6932768 to help people plan appropriately and avoid debt cccs asked its clients to share tips on how they are preparing for a debt free holiday
6932769 ive been using my tip money from work to pay for gifts and im spreading out buying them so i dont have a large expense at one time
6932770 my goal is to be done buying gifts by thanksgiving
6932771 another great reason to buy now is that you arent rushed i think often times when we save all the shopping until the end we spend more because we are in a hurry we have the mind set that we just need to get something so we dont think it through and spend more and one more reason to shop now is if you have a specific gift in mind you can watch for it to go on sale or watch for coupons to purchase it
6932772 every time you buy a non essential item such as a cup of coffee or cigarettes set aside an equal amount for your holiday purchases
6932773 if you cant afford the savings portion dont buy the item until you can this will serve two purposes you will save money and also be made to realize what you are spending money on and how quickly it adds up

6932787 menurut saya itu pernyataan yang tidak patut alangkah baiknya fadel muhammad dipanggil dan dibicarakan secara baik baik kenapa kemudian harus mengatakan untuk mempersilakan fadel untuk pindah partai ini kan makin menunjukan internal golkar sudah tidak solid lagi fadel itu kan kader terbaik
6932788 kalau kemudian juga fadel muhammad mengatakan gagal menjadi calon anggota legislatif karena dekat dengan saya memangnya kenapa memangnya ada apa semua di dpp golkar sebagian juga dekat dengan saya yang saya lihat ada yang tidak menginginkan fadel maju karena dianggap sebagai pesaing
6932789 sama sekali pernyataan itu tidaklah tepat sama sekali seharusnya kita bisa mengoreksi dan tidak benar seorang pemimpin kemudian dinilai anak buahnya bermasalah kemudian mengeluarkan pernyataan seperti itu meski saya menyatakan akan tetap loyal tapi saya memang kecewa dengan oknum oknum di dpp
6932790 ini kan sudah menjelang pemilu partai golkar membutuhkan suatu soliditas organisasi konsolidasi partai kita butuhkan seharunya dpp mengambil langkah langkah yang seharusnya memperkuat organisasi dan jangan sampai mengambil langkah langkah yang mengarah kepada organisasi tidak semakin solid seperti yang dilakukan terhadap fadel muhammad ini kan mengganggu soliditas organiasasi
6932791 jauh lebih baik ketua umum jusuf kalla bersama para pengurus golkar lain memanggil fadel kemudian menjelaskan mengapa tidak dicalonkan itu kan jauh lebih baik saya juga dengar pak jusuf kalla mengatakan begini kalau fadel merasa tidak puas mau keluar partai silakan itu kan pernyataan yang tidak patut makin menegaskan sudah tidak ada soliditas partai lagi
6932792 saya yang mengarahkan para anggota dprd dari partai golkar agar memilih fadel muhammad menjadi gubernur gorontalo pertama kali jadi kalau dari segi kedekatan sebagian orang orang dpp juga dekat dengan saya janganlah mengambil sikap yang hanya tidak menguntungkan partai menjelang pemilu 2009

6932801 that is what is done by the opposition when they attack continuously eventually if something is not true or is a lie or repetitive slander at the end it will either be true or at least it will raise doubts
6932802 this is what is said to be a perception in politics perceptions are more important than truth or fact i am aware of this game and i will face it this is the reason why i have explained that i am not involved at all in the altantuya shaariibuu case

6932805 i understand that tun dr mahathir wants leadership changes to take place as soon as possible he would want it to happen in december but my calculations are different my calculation is for me to put the next election as the main consideration not this year or next year or 2010
6932806 it means i will have to make sure that the party strength is not jeopardised when i face the election as the main leader so that is the reason to me the date is secondary what is most important is umnos strength in the 13th general election due in 2012 or 2013

6932832 crisis is the condition that validates and sustains the leftist collectivist moral code the left needs crisis and disasters to survive and continue the orthodoxy therefore where is the left will always be crisis artificially created if need be and victims written off as collateral damage in struggle for greater good examples of artificial crises in america are the results of heroic struggle by progressive politicians energy housing immigration outsourcing crises can also be entirely imaginary ozone holes man made global warming overpopulation exhaustion of resources and on the political front its bushs dictatorship erosion of liberties in america illegal wiretapping torture imperialist invasions of other countries and controlled explosion of the world trade center

6932836 the subsequent blame america attitude among the intellectual trend setters enraged me liberalism no longer seemed laughable it was dangerous suicidal madness that had to be confronted i took up political activism
6932837 is self sustaining and self correcting the left whether democrats here or old soviet union deeply believe commerce must be managed but what they create is a system for themselves they cant help but create an economy to benefit themselves if the left gets control of economy it will be managed and re engineered to be corrupt is antithesis of capitalism the necessary condition and by product of capitalism is freedom is designed for people to take care of themselves regressive economic thinking is patterned to subvert freedom so corrupt enrich themselves at your expense you work and they grow fat capitalism is other way around you work you grow fat

6932882 it put the hubcap down and then banged on the window as if it was trying to get my attention
6932883 it was almost like it wanted to give me the wheel cap

6932886 she asked me whose the hubcap was so it could be returned to the car in front

6932952 it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs and comes short again and again because there is not effort without error and shortcomings but who does actually strive to do the deed who knows the great enthusiasm the great devotion who spends himself in a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least he fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat

6932955 funerals are often about bringing comfort to those that have lost and evelyn would have wanted a service like this that brings hope to her children in the promise of seeing her again
6932956 but for her friends i believe she would want this to be a time where they take stock in what they have gained
6932957 as a long time resident of portage lakes she did more than understand the power of candor in business and personal relationships in this community she served as an exemplar
6932958 no doubt in knowing evelyn you have had your politics scrutinized by the gaze through her roosevelt democrat colored lenses or you have been called a bastard or a prostitute in the same manner that she would be announcing your job title or role as an in law
6932959 so while we her family reflect on what we have lost i want to take a moment and stand with her friends who she would want leaving this day enriched by what they have earned
6932960 you earned her trust that her worldly sense of humor would be taken in the context of her sharing her environment with you
6932961 the subject of pesonal gain rarely has a place in the parlance of polite societys funeral ettiquette but just as she asked for outside the box thinking when she was a part of your lives a dedicated and candid memory of her demands it again now and everytime you reflect and think of the ways your lives are richer for having been by her side

6932964 the local media thrive on negativity they have nothing good to say about their country if there is something bad about this country the local media will break a leg to be the first to write about it theyre a bunch of negative people who live in a world of their own and are merely there to earn a living and not make sa a better place
6932965 there is noise and joy and emotional honesty in the way we live when we as a nation are happy we celebrate when we are sad we are sad together does anything else really matter at least we are together in the queue for petrol and or torches

6932967 xenophobic attacks and immigration challenges are not new they are not even particularly south african for example in russia since the beginning of 2008 there have been 211 reported victims of hate crimes with

6932979 she was murdered and you are responsible from the evidence its clear that sarah lunde did not have an easy life but it was her life and you chose to end that life and for that you deserve the maximum punishment
6932980 can you tell me the reason why maybe this happened
6932981 because of the volume of the circumstantial evidence we went that way
6932982 no temptation has seized you except what is common to man and god is faithful he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear but when you are tempted he will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it
6932983 how in the world did they get so effing big
6932984 whether the kid is disabled or unruly or just being a hormonal teenager the state is saying hey we have a really easy option for you
6932985 if we save one child from being abused its well well worth it
6932986 the main interest i have is that it gives the mother or a parent another option of what to do with a child before they do something drastic
6932987 circumvents every rational practice in child welfare that im aware of
6932988 drafters will sometimes try to say as little as possible so they dont create ambiguity but drafters here succeeded in writing the law in such a limited fashion that the entire provision is ambiguous

6932995 about 30 per cent of people with hepatitis b will develop cancer or cirrhosis and die young i dont understand why these people are willing to sacrifice their child for a warped idea when the benefits far outweigh the risks
6932996 i dont agree with the one size fits all policy he is a small baby 2 49kg and they give the same dose to babies twice his size i just wanted time to get more information about the vaccine
6932997 we are here to integrate airpower into joint operations in iraq and ensuring we make the most of our unmanned aerial system capabilities is just one of many ways we do that

6933023 well have you back to port in just a minute
6933024 so how do we get out of here without anybody seeing us
6933025 thats what got us into trouble in the first place
6933026 in fact looks like you were flying through a restricted area and i dont even have an original flight plan for your unit its still in the maintenance pool

6933033 well they may or may not have the leanings towards the new age philosophies for which i am making the list
6933034 we all have pieces to the puzzle so if we are exploring in any spiritual arena then we are all exploring the same thing so why am i segregating types
6933035 i am a child of south africa and i can make a difference in my country today
6933036 well what can i do why arent the cops doing it or the government why must i do anything i pay tax i deserve and so on and so on

6933039 in mental health as in education trauma leaves children behind
6933040 thats disappointing but its encouraging that a substantial body of evidence supports both individual and group cognitive behavioral therapy
6933041 there had been some clues from veterinary medicine as well as an outbreak in boston that listeria could be a food borne illness
6933042 but that had never been proven in humans before probably because most outbreaks occur in small clusters and you cant get enough epidemiologic information
6933043 they were using raw manure on the fields and the guy was raising sheep as well and he also had listeria in his sheep flock
6933044 and of course in the pregnancy related cases the mothers survived but they lost their child often a late term infant or sometimes an early miscarriage
6933045 unfortunately some of these outbreaks actually inform the public that there is that danger out there
6933046 we dont want to use that as a normal way of informing the public but thats the way that it sometimes happens
6933047 it basically said that instead of this being an organism of unknown etiology or unknown source that this in fact was a food borne organism like any other like campylobacter or salmonella and therefore we need to start paying attention to manufacturing issues we need to pay attention to what goes on on the abattoir floor
6933048 in ontario there are three confirmed deaths at this point linked to the investigation and another is still under investigation
6933049 there are some additional cases of listeria currently under investigation in quebec
6933050 we have one confirmed case of listeria thats associated with the provincial outbreak and that case is deceased
6933051 we have confirmed that the primary cause of death is listeriosis
6933052 what well find out is whether the illness and the meat were linked if its the same strain
6933053 weve put in place a new system that allows us to detect an outbreak and to see a pattern very early in the game
6933054 im glad we got hold of it early and now well take serious steps working with the feds to put it behind us
6933055 we then notified the canadian food inspection agency on aug 6 to tell them we had these positive food samples and the cfia then worked with us to collect further samples from the nursing home
6933056 it was based on the results of those early tests and as well based on communication that maple leaf foods put out to its distributors that we on august 14 asked the long term care facilities to put certain products on hold
6933057 well the protocol says up to 24 hours it can take the average is eight we did this one in five
6933058 just a little bit every day however much you can manage after school
6933059 and dont look so grumpy the days are shorter and shorter

6933061 hard to tell at this angle are they heading for us
6933062 whered they even go i mean really are they just hiding back there until we leave
6933063 this isnt hard hadyn some big birds dive bombed us they dropped these cool tubes it makes no sense its awesome totally factor 10 cool
6933064 maybe theyre some sort of carrier pigeon but do carrier pigeons even fly anymore
6933065 only on gilligans island tv land listen to me youre just guessing
6933066 obviously they are what if they need to carry these things farther still what if theyre just resting what if they are trained to do this when they need to rest drop their packages find a hole rest then grab their stuff and carry on
6933067 so are you suggesting we flush them out cause there is no way im going to crawl back there they can get out later on their own

6933077 our primary objective in this investigation is to locate caylee

6933117 the tankers exterior lighting is not currently compatible with night vision goggle operations which limits the receivers ability to use their night vision systems during air refueling operations
6933118 our solution is simple modify tanker aircraft with night vision friendly exterior lighting and night vision compatible interior lighting for the boom pod this can have an immediate impact for our tanker forces in the deployed theater
6933119 the idea is to make air refueling at night safer
6933120 right now during night time air refueling operations in black out conditions pilots in aircraft receiving fuel have to remove their night vision goggles prior to an air refueling to prevent required visual references from being washed out or obscured in the night vision goggle image also current external lighting on the aircraft is easily detected by ground threats using the unaided eye correcting these deficiencies has a direct impact on mission accomplishment and safety in flight
6933121 in setting this up we looked for low cost commercial and government off the shelf lighting technology to make the kc 135 exterior and boom pod interior lighting selectively night vision compatible yet undetectable to the unaided eye
6933122 then the afrl stepped in and designed and installed the lighting solutions to save time and cost and to decrease risk lighting luminance assessments were done in a controlled laboratory environment prior to hardware installation on the kc 135 used for the demonstration
6933123 this initiative showed that a low cost night vision lighting alternative is out there and is feasible we found that a night vision lighting system can eliminate the time necessary for receiver pilots to don or doff their night vision equipment while performing night time air refueling operations this is an improved capability when compared to the current operations in the field
6933124 the national guard bureau and other agencies are pursuing funding to accomplish flight and environmental testing on the night vision lighting system
6933125 it is ambs recommendation this initiative be considered for fielding by air mobility command as resources allow and requirements dictate
6933126 all little towns and communities in denmark have a village grocery which is often a good little walk to get to if you live out in the country so if you have to get some milk you end up taking your dog along for exercise which is why you see these hunde parkering spots on the side of many of the grocers

6933133 at the heart of the matter is oil and land
6933134 mindanao land houses some of the largest oil and natural gas deposits in the asia pacific region multi national corporate interest to acquire and control these reserves has been real reason for armed conflict in the mindanao area with increased us and philippine militarization foreign mining and landgrabbing for decades not religious conflict or terrorism as projected by malacanang or the us government
6933135 the us government is also notorious in its history of annihilation and genocide of the indigenous peoples of north america and repression against racial minorities it cannot be sincere in building peace with or conceding to the aspirations of bangsamoro people just look at its track record
6933136 by issuing a bogus memorandum of agreement on ancestral domain the arroyo clique is shamelessly and covertly pushing to change the philippine constitution there is no intention to cultivate peace with the people of mindanao on arroyos part as an abuse of her executive powers arroyos provisions with the blessing of the us government will include an extension of her unpopular dictatorial term

6933192 er was een gezin uit brazili met twee kinderen op onze stage school deze kinderen zaten toevallig in onze groepen groep 5 en groep 3 klas 3 en klas 1 zoals ze dat nog in suriname zeggen deze kinderen konden nederlands praten noch verstaan toen wij daar stage liepen kwamen we erachter dat er niets aan gedaan werd de mogelijkheden waren er niet er was helemaal niets aan extra hulp extra materialen etc de leerkrachten stonden allemaal voor de klas de klassen zaten propvol rond de 30 leerlingen we geven toe dat er weinig mogelijkheid was om de kinderen te helpen maar ze deden ook weinig moeite ze zaten de hele dag in de klas niets te doen begrepen bijna nooit wat er gedaan moest worden staarden voor zich uit en werden logisch vervelend ze schreven de teksten maar over maar hadden geen idee wat ze deden
6933193 when youre a parent youll have to make important decisions that not everyone will find favorable
6933194 chenoa weve talked about this over and over why cant you understand our point of view your mother and i are thinking about our childrens futures
6933195 this is something we must do were not doing this to be mean
6933196 but my family is here on the rez how come youve changed your mind about helping the indian
6933197 we want something better for the both of you please try to understand that
6933198 how come you said you cared about the indian and you wanted to help them how come you changed your mind about that
6933199 your mother and i are in agreement about the matter and thats all that needs to be said about it were going to ohio and im going to talk to douglas ream about my working in his clinic with his son in law besides i wanted to move closer to my mother now that my father has passed away my sister and brother arent in a very good position right now financially to help out and my mother needs help
6933200 you just have to understand that what were doing is for the best
6933201 its a cold day for a walk to nowhere climb in and well talk
6933202 have you heard my father wants to leave the rez
6933203 sometimes we must do some things we dont want to do granddaughter
6933204 life is full of uncertainty we knew when anna went to college she would be free to make the choice to leave the rez she told your grandmother and me that if she ever found her place in the world she would go however she didnt and she returned to us when she married your father who was not from this area we knew that leaving would still be possible but we didnt know when sometimes our paths change and we go off in different directions
6933205 in order for people to live together in peace they have to respect one another the old are respected for their wisdom and the young because they are the future of the people chenoa the outcome of this respect should keep peace within the family understand your father is making a great sacrifice its the gift of self and its the most meaningful thing a person can give victor has told me he loves the apache but he knows he cannot stay hes making this move to keep his family strong although he is an indian and not touched by materialism he knows he is letting his children down and it hurts him here
6933206 a broken spirit isnt a pleasant thing i wont stand in his way and you shouldnt either
6933207 shichoo if i moved away from the reservation would you forget me
6933208 i would never do that to a part of the family well keep in touch and your father promised that you and river can visit us during the summer nothing is definite because he hasnt had a job offer yet
6933209 shichoo if i get my parents permission could i stay with you and isabel
6933210 if you get their permission youll be welcome in our home
6933211 we are nearing your home would you like me to drop you off
6933212 i ran into grandfather and he gave me a ride around the block
6933213 i want to stay with grandfather and grandmother you can take river with you to ohio but im not going
6933214 when we go to ohio well go as a complete family were not going to leave you behind to live with your grandparents
6933215 we cannot leave you behind because my parents are too poor to take care of a child they barely have enough for themselves let alone taking in a grandchild even if my father said it would be all right for you to stay it would be too much of a hardship for them
6933216 and if i didnt have my little girl right beside me sharing new adventures with me then my life would have no meaning whatsoever
6933217 i dont want you to leave me behind shimaa id rather have old rusty massey the shaman tie me to a post and skin me alive slowly
6933218 i wouldnt let rusty skin you alive nor will anyone else if i have anything to say about it
6933219 well be together as a family and thats all that matters honey if youre anxious about leaving the rez then you must take this concern to jesus and talk to him about it hes a special friend you can always talk to and hell listen to you
6933220 you think about that honey i know youll feel better when youve made the right decision and stick with it
6933221 now i need you to do me a big favor and set the table for supper okay
6933222 if we move to ohio can we still visit the rez maybe i can spend the summer here and
6933223 yes child your father and i have been considering everything weve been praying about this together and letting the lord be our guide nevertheless you mustnt worry about all these things chenoa because your father hasnt really discussed this with douglas ream we must take life one day at a time and not worry needlessly you shouldnt be anxious for nothing but only pray about the matter
6933224 what happens if dad doesnt get a job offer from dr ream
6933225 well if douglas isnt able to offer your father a position in his clinic then hell have to search for a good offer someplace else
6933226 im showing not like minnie driver showing but us pregnant women can explode at any moment and in the best interest of me you and your sneakers lets take a couple of steps back and let move on by
6933227 it would be easy to write this off as a harry potter clone

6933236 everything that is alive pulsates with energy and all of this energy contains information while it is not surprising that practitioners of alternative or complementary medicine accept this concept
6933237 youre saying that my emotions are stored in my body
6933238 absolutely you didnt realize that there are phenomena that we cant explain without going into energy
6933239 identify a specific brain chemical that appears to influence how well youll perform under stress and how emotionally resilient youll be after a critical incident the more you have of this powerful ingredient the better off youll likely be when your life is on the line

6933272 canadas economy shrank in the first quarter the government is on the brink of a deficit inflation is rising and workers are being laid off yet the finance minister and prime minister say theyre happy with the fundamentals the fundamentals are in trouble its time they dropped their ostrich approach to the economy get their heads out of the sand and undo the damage theyve done
6933273 a liberal government understands that innovation and investing in canadians are keys to success
6933274 we will build on our solid history of balanced budgets progressive tax cuts and targeted spending and we will return canadas budget to a healthy surplus allowing us to pay down debt and reduce the infrastructure deficit
6933275 a liberal government will put canadas economy back on track
6933276 in the next election the liberal party will be the choice for canadians who want to see our economy prosper again the liberal team is ready to bring back our partys record of economic leadership
6933277 of course we could and should speed up this transition by insisting that the price of carbon based energy include the costs of the environmental damage it causes i have long supported a sharp reduction in payroll taxes with the difference made up in co2 taxes we should tax what we burn not what we earn this is the single most important policy change we can make
6933278 lets be conscious right away that dions carbon tax idea is revenue neutral meaning that this new tax will in no way affect our household budgets a carbon tax is already in place in norway and sweden and soon in british columbia a similar tax has been in place here in quebec since the end of last year and will bring in an estimated 200 million most of which is to be set aside to finance public transit energy efficiency programs for individuals and businesses as well as other programs designed to reduced pollution the idea of a carbon tax is gaining in popularity elsewhere and not always in the first places you would think the right wing american magazine the economist called for such a tax to be levied in the united states and even the president of the canadian association of petroleum producers is no longer opposed to one
6933279 this tax should have been in existence a long time ago
6933280 the liberal green plan is stirring a lot of interest and we ought to take a closer look at heart what this is about is more than just implementing a tax on carbon its an opportunity to discuss the reform of our fiscal system there is a broad consensus among economists that we should tax less on what is useful and desirable such as work and investments while we should tax more on what isnt such as pollution this is what the liberal green plan aims to do
6933281 the coalition qu beckyoto considers the carbon tax plan proposed by st phane dion as representing a step in the right direction for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
6933282 you have to congratulate st phane dion for initiating an intelligent debate on an important question
6933283 this plan must be taken seriously a similar tax has already been implemented in british columbia since february 2008 as well as in sweden norway finland holland and the united kingdom whatever may be said by supporters of a more universal and simpler approach not to say theoretical and more simplistic the redistribution scheme included in the proposed liberal tax plan constitutes a fair balance between individuals and business
6933284 far from being opposed to carbon taxes economists in canada are if anything leading the charge in that direction the green shift proposal put forward by st phane dion and the liberal party for example is largely based on a paper written by jack mintz and nancy olewiler jack mintz former president of the c d howe institute and now poster boy literally for the school of policy studies at the university of calgary is widely acknowledged as perhaps canadas foremost expert on taxation it is remarkable the degree of consensus that exists among canadian economists that some form of carbon taxation is both a desirable and necessary part of any realistic carbon reduction strategy to suggest otherwise id suggest is a distortion of the truth
6933285 the income generated by a carbon tax can be used to cut income taxes build more public transit upgrade trains develop renewable energy sources and retrofit homes and buildings with energy efficient technology for 20 years scientists have warned of the need for urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions leading economists have shown that the cost to bring emissions down will be about one per cent of gdp annually while the costs incurred if we dont reduce emissions could be economically catastrophic when politicians businesspeople and citizens show leadership by proposing or implementing solutions to the real problems facing the planet yes more than 90 per cent certain is as real as it gets in science they deserve our support not mockery and politically motivated misinformation
6933286 the green shift is a bold plan and one that will provide a significant leap forward in canadas contribution to the fight against climate change
6933287 i like the fact that mr dion is putting a real price on pollution and then he throws in the added benefit of reducing income taxes and guarantees revenue neutrality through an independent third party
6933288 this policy represents a seismic conceptual shift in the federal tax system sending the message that the dion liberals are prepared to re invest in social and environmental policy in a creative way this is a sharp divergence from the conservative agenda of market based social policy and a climate change policy designed to expand canadas dependence on and pollution from the oil industry in the next election finally voters will have a clear choice to make
6933289 while prime minister stephen harper has pronounced dions plan as crazy canadians themselves dont appear to believe this rather canadians seem to be ready to at least consider seriously a plan that would impose heavier taxes on them for the sake of combating climate change but with depending on income part or all of this coming back to them in the form of compensating tax cuts
6933290 mr dions proposed carbon tax is a good example of the kind of policy canada needs to fight climate change
6933291 i dont think the plan will be negative on growth in fact it will probably be positive because what youre doing is taking taxes off investment and work effort and youre putting it on to consumption
6933292 the whole concept of the plan is to say first of all we can try to improve our tax policy and our environmental policy at the same time
6933293 i think that it will take a few years for the liberal plan to start to make an impact but the point is that theyre proposing something that is theyve got the work right and thats we really like that
6933294 i actually think that the way forward really is to have a carbon tax regime such as the liberals green shift and then over the long run implement a cap and trade system as well
6933295 as i say in broad brush strokes well done mr dion
6933296 the idea is sensible theres a growing consensus to do something about emissions we need to put a price on carbon
6933297 if its implemented i can see this plan making a tangible difference because it puts the machinery in place to reduce greenhouse gases
6933298 if they combine these measures with a whole suite of other measures by 2020 we may have achieved the levels that we need to stem the worst effects of climate change
6933299 this is a step in the right direction there has to be a price on carbon and this is a measure that is necessary if we want to confront the issue of climate change
6933300 its definitely an important part of what we need to do to combat the climate crisis and its great to see that we have a political party willing to put front and centre the climate change problem in its campaign proposals for the next election

6933311 si bien estas medidas apuntan hacia un sentido correcto claramente

6933342 you should definitely mention hevia a spanish bagpiper who has made five albums
6933343 ive only heard the first two albums but the music is very suikoden ish and although it concentrates mostly on bagpipe there are other instruments as well
6933344 i wouldnt say its a love hate relationship its more of need and fear relationship
6933345 they need amazon because its probably every publishers first or second largest client but they fear amazon because its every publishers first or second biggest client

6933374 but if it doesnt please you to worship the lord choose for yourselves today the one you will worship the gods your fathers worshiped beyond the euphrates river or the gods of the amorites in whose land you are living as for me and my family we will worship the lord
6933375 a critical problem in churches today is that we dont call people to greatness we call them to mediocrity we dont call people to too much we call them to too little the call of jesus is not a call to do nothing it is a call to follow a call to sacrifice a call to die the call to follow jesus is a radical revolution not radical relaxation
6933376 helpful to our churches youth group and or other people
6933377 why were not emergent by 2 guys who should be
6933378 now come on it is going to be a good day
6933379 what election observers did not see in a rigged election
6933380 the national election committee nec has initiated changes in the voter registration process that could have far reaching consequences the nec is creating unnecessary and untimely work and procedures for people most of whom are unable to do it the necs initiative could practically end up depriving millions of citizens of their voting rights the victims will be mainly non cpp members because all cpp members are identified as such by their village chiefs and will receive in time related information assistance and facilities to do the work imposed by the nec most of those who do not support the ruling cpp will be left in the dark many international observers do not realize that the results of the 2007 and 2007 elections are largely being decided now through a biased registration process
6933381 the national election committees changes to the voter registration process are deciding the outcomes of the 2007 commune and 2008 national elections before they have had a chance to take place many international observers do not realize that the results of the 2007 and 2008 elections are largely being decided now through the registration process
6933382 i became known here in europe as a support striker at seville but at real i never played there
6933383 playing in midfield at real madrid i couldnt capitalise on my skill what is for certain is that here ill be able to express my attacking nature to its best
6933384 clubs like liverpool are always looking round the world for players and there is always going to be someone new challenging you
6933385 i spent seven years at liverpool and played more than 250 games the challenge in italy was the right one for my career and the time was right to change to another country
6933386 yo tengo que pensar que est n cayendo en pr cticas de dopaje
6933387 while you were sleeping the world changed in an instant
6933388 i hold you close to my heart this is not an emo song
6933389 while you were sleeping the world changed in an instant
6933390 weve all got our generators filled up with gas and oil and our nonperishable food
6933391 we stand by our account and our reports and what we know and i cant reconcile why the interior ministry would have a different figure
6933392 all allegations of civilian casualties are taken very seriously coalition forces make every effort to prevent the injury or loss of innocent lives
6933393 if you had me cover the world series my first story might be amusing but for the rest of the games people might want to find out what was going on in the dugout in the locker room on the field thats the same for political coverage
6933394 somebody who doesnt cover politics on a regular basis might provide the side dish but not the main entr e
6933395 if you have somebody out there who doesnt know the people involved and doesnt know the players or the deputies or the campaign managers standing next to them in the lunch line then you lose something
6933396 there is an important distinction between the casual viewer and the engaged viewer
6933397 engaged viewers beginning in 1988 and 1992 could watch every moment of the convention if they desired casual viewers watched only what happened to come before them in prime time such as two or three key speeches and the official vote
6933398 today the engaged viewer has increased in large part because of the internet engaged viewers have greater access to schedules on the internet but more importantly there is so much build up for a wider variety of activities
6933399 the pace then not only seemed a lot slower as i recall but at least one or two network anchors pulled up stakes and left san diego early because there was no news
6933400 this time of course there is such intense interest in the conventions for a number of reasons no incumbent is running obamas candidacy is historic and mccain is a fascinating figure no one would dream of leaving early
6933401 but i want to beat what i had last year
6933402 ill give it another season of football then another season of baseball and then id like to see where i have more potential more of a future more upside
6933403 im taking this year to get better and see where it leads me
6933404 weve talked about that hell get all the attention now its critical for the people around him to help take the heat off we have to be good enough that if opponents double or triple him other people take advantage of that opportunity
6933405 it will be interesting to see how teams play us
6933406 i think with one year under my belt having a better feel for the offense ill be ready decker will get his fair share of balls just because he runs such good routes but these other guys we have there will be opportunity
6933407 ive always loved baseball i played it since i was like 3 but football has grown on me too
6933408 over the years i have had a few replies usually from norway or denmark
6933409 i have never had one from st andrews and never one that has taken this long to wash up

6933420 mccains campaign says the arizona senator has four residences condos in phoenix arlington va and coronado calif and a house in sedona ariz all are owned by his wife cindy and their children who also own eight other residential properties those include four other houses at the 15 acre sedona spread and four more condos according to real estate records and the senators financial disclosure reports the dozen properties are worth more than 10 million current assessments show
6933421 when youre poor it can be hard to pay the bills when youre rich its hard to keep track of all the bills that need paying its a lesson cindy mccain learned the hard way when newsweek raised questions about an overdue property tax bill on a la jolla calif property owned by a trust that she oversees
6933422 im rubber your glue whatever you say bounces off of me and sticks to you
6933423 all i really needed to know i learned in kindergarten
6933424 if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy is fundamentally strong but if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6933425 mccain who has portrayed obama as an elitist is the son and grandson of admirals the associated press estimates his wife a beer heiress is worth 100 million obama was raised by a single mother who relied at times on food stamps and he went to top schools on scholarships and loans his income has increased from book sales since he spoke at the 2004 democratic convention
6933426 what the what did she just draw on my butt
6933427 has seriously degraded cms ability to meet its responsibilities in combating fraud and abuse
6933428 la noche est estrellada y tiritan azules los astros a lo lejos
6933429 it would be easy to write this off as a harry potter clone
6933430 except that it looks far far darker in tone than any of the potter films have been so far much more in line with fantasy pictures from the late eighties than anything current only with much better production values
6933431 should know that appropriating the identity of a teacher or school administrator to create a fraudulent internet social profile is unacceptable and that engaging in such conduct will have consequences
6933432 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6933433 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
6933434 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6933435 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6933436 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6933437 im sure hell make a wonderful choice for our party and for our country and well just have to wait until next friday to find out the answer to those questions
6933438 no temptation has overtaken you except what is common to humanity god is faithful and he will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able but with the temptation he will also provide a way of escape so that you are able to bear it
6933439 he who did not spare his own son but gave him up for us all how will he not also along with him graciously give us all things
6933440 why would matthew a direct eyewitness use a source written by mark who everybody agrees was an indirect eyewitness
6933441 whoever acknowledges me i will acknowledge before my father in heaven
6933442 these have been written so that you may believe that jesus is the christ the son of god and that believing you may have life in his name
6933443 why do you call me good no one is good except god alone
6933444 now father glorify me together with yourself with the glory which i had with you before the world was
6933445 now we know that you know all things and have no need for anyone to question you by this we believe that you came from god
6933446 for where two or three have gathered together in my name i am there in their midst
6933447 go therefore and make disciples of all the nations baptizing them in the name of the father and the son and the holy spirit teaching them to observe all that i commanded you and lo i am with you always even to the end of the age
6933448 all authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth
6933449 in two natures without confusion without change without division without separation the distinction of natures by no means taken away by the union but rather the property of each nature being preserved and concurring in one person and one subsistence not parted or divided into two persons but one and the same son and only begotten god the word the lord jesus christ
6933450 theres two camps in hillary land theres the peacemakers and the pumas party unity my aunt fannie

6933455 the great outdoors that the lord has made for us and to sit here and hear his word outside
6933456 we say we worship outdoors by the seashore like jesus did
6933457 but they were probably standing next to donkeys and camels and you know the transportation of the day
6933458 isnt there a risk when all is said and done that its so convenient god wont count it
6933459 it is being investigated i cant say anything more than that by statute i am not allowed to disclose personnel information
6933460 its what christopher shays has always stood for he goes where the truth takes him
6933461 its not what is republican or democrat its whats right for america
6933462 barack obama has strong positive vision for america and a long record of bipartisan accomplishment and we are pleased that it is respected by his democratic and republican colleagues in the house
6933463 however in this race the good people of connecticut should know that barack obama supports jim himes and believes himes is the candidate who will bring the change american families need to washington

6933467 i just walked right on past him to the bedroom and got my gun
6933468 i said what are you doing in my house he just kept saying he didnt do it
6933469 were always evaluating whats happening in the marketplace and certainly something thats happening in the last couple of months is that sonys managed to sell some boxes
6933470 so whether or not you like developing for that platform if theyve got millions of people connected to that platform and buying their games you have to take it seriously
6933471 theres zero chance of it happening this year its something thats being talked about right now as the game is gaining popularity and looking like its going to be a hit
6933472 tarras has several tracks that would fit right into an rpg
6933473 you should definitely mention hevia a spanish bagpiper who has made five albums
6933474 ive only heard the first two albums but the music is very suikoden ish and although it concentrates mostly on bagpipe there are other instruments as well

6933480 the officer indicated he was unaware it was in his lunch pail or lunch bucket and we believed him
6933481 it was something that was supposed to go ahead and catch an incident someone bringing in something maybe it was a mistake or he may have been trying to do something wrong we dont know
6933482 on the transcendent issues the most important issues of our day ive been totally in agreement and support of president bush
6933483 they think that they are going to stay in georgia breaking this the ceasefire accord
6933484 they are talking about staying in south ossetia and abkhazia even making more stations around some buffer zones and this kind of thing which is absolutely not with this peace accord
6933485 it is my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
6933486 this should be strongly rejected by western states as guaranteed to keep the dispute at boiling point with negative ramifications for wider east west relations
6933487 todays reports of russian military withdrawal appear to be a step forward to implement these commitments
6933488 but i remain deeply concerned that russian forces have not withdrawn to the pre august 7 position as agreed
6933489 biasanya mereka suka minta bagian bila kita dapat duit tidak tahu mereka kok tahu saja bila kita dapat rejeki kalau misalnya sepi gitu nggak ada pemasukan mereka juga nggak bakalan minta upeti

6933492 seringnya sih gali lubang tutup lubang hutang sama tetangga dan teman untuk menutup kekurangan sehari hari nanti pada saat dapat rejeki baru dilunasi
6933493 uang tersebut dari hasil memperbaiki makam karena tadi guwe kerjakan sendiri jadi uangnya nggak dibagi sama teman teman kalau udah rejeki nggak akan lari kemana dan rejeki itu sudah ada yang ngatur
6933494 saya berharap mudah mudahan anak saya tidak ada yang mengikuti profesi bapaknya alhamdulillah yang sulung sudah bekerja di tempat penyablonan yang cewek kerja di salah satu bank di jakarta pusat sebagai cleaning service
6933495 kalau badan capek paling enam makam kalau lagi fit bisa sampai sepuluh makam selain itu juga tergantung orderan kalau lagi ramai kayak menjelang bulan puasa maupun menjelang lebaran seperti ini walaupun badan sakit pasti guwe paksain
6933496 was less about drunken hook ups at celebutard wannabes and more about well real people
6933497 they should have a mtv origins channel or whatever and only show original programming from back in the day pre real world and actual music videos from start to finish and then see how it does ratings wise vs the actual mtv it probably wouldnt do as well but i bet it would do better than viacom thinks

6933500 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage
6933501 weve all got our generators filled up with gas and oil and our nonperishable food
6933502 they go to these companies and they say we want you to give us this money
6933503 connect with influential government officials such as cabinet members the president next president

6933507 brings widespread attention to the obesity and chronic disease disparities in southern l a
6933508 we are surrounded by a smorgasbord of highly palatable pervasively marketed inexpensive readily accessible nutrient poor but energy dense foods
6933509 coupled with seductive sedentary entertainment and transportation options and re engineering of the built environment to favor automobile transportation over pedestrian or mass transit our genetic hard wiring to avoid exercise and eat salty sweet and fatty foods easily explains the occurrence of the small caloric excesses and energy expenditure deficits necessary to produce the epidemic
6933510 cheap corn transformed into high fructose corn syrup is what allowed coca cola to move from the svelte 8 ounce bottle of soda ubiquitous in the 70s to the chubby 20 ounce bottle of today cheap corn transformed into cheap beef is what allowed mcdonalds to supersize its burgers and still sell many of them for no more than a dollar cheap corn gave us a whole raft of new highly processed foods including the world beating chicken nugget which if you study its ingredients you discover is really a most ingenious transubstantiation of corn from the cornfed chicken it contains to the bulking and binding agents that hold it together
6933511 until we somehow deal with this surfeit of calories coming off the farm it is unlikely that even the most well intentioned food companies or public health campaigns will have much success changing the way we eat
6933512 citizens can become involved with grassroots advocacy groups to chip away at the food industrys hold on our politicians and locales much as they pecked big tobacco to death initially with smoking bans and restrictions gradually changing social norms and building political will
6933513 as addressing the paucity of options rather than controlling people
6933514 w ith the potential for a blogger around almost every corner and delegates with cellphone cameras everywhere including private parties that shut out journalists and bloggers privacy will be hard to come by
6933515 sort of decided that among the many outreach tools they wanted to have an online presence and wanted a democratic blogger and a republican blogger to dig deeper into the issues and ferret out waste in local government and write about it
6933516 when jen ran taking down words she had a way of getting her message out that was funny and irreverent and infuriating at the same time especially if you were a republican part of the goal with stopgoverninglikethis com is to advocate for kernan shepard with a certain pithy snarky attitude that connects with readers with varying levels of acceptance
6933517 should i call in and tell them ill be in late
6933518 should i asked to be dropped off drive myself or skate like a madman to the bus stop
6933519 im singularly responsible for harvey dent and the arc of that character and then everything else in between we would just collaborate on to various degrees
6933520 shopping for labels shopping for love manolo and louis its all im thinking of i shop for purses while love walks out the door dont cry buy a bag and get over it

6933525 a rock star a pop star ha ha i never saw them as real heroes compared to what some people do in their lives i see them more as the plastic version of a hero the kind that can break quite easily
6933526 hey how have you been im dying to see what happens

6933529 yes were going to help each other out oh by the way lets do my thing first

6933578 italians fell upon them like a lot of apache indians men were dragged from their homes clubbed trampeled upon and made targets for the shotguns rifles and small arms that the mob had brought with them the women were insulted slapped and two of them while begging for mercy were shot down and fatally injured no one was safe from the mob men women and children infants the elderly and even invalids were attacked
6933579 the rioting continued and on the second day the italian miners announced
6933580 nobody knows exactly how many negroes died before the tumult subsided but as the years went by colored folks at least referred to the incident as the spring valley massacre
6933581 even in the creation of sundown towns ethnic whites eventually allowed themselves to be pitted against their fellow black citizens in multi ethnic towns black citizens increasingly served as the main function of americas primary

6933586 a 6 year old black boy was critically wounded tuesday when he was shot in the head by suspected latino gang members as the victims family drove through the harbor gateway neighborhood on their way to an auto auction los angeles police chief william j bratton said
6933587 two latino males flashed gang signs before opening fire on the red gmc yukon with six people inside including a woman who is eight months pregnant bratton said the rear window of the suv was shattered by the gunfire and one of the rounds hit the boy in the head he said
6933588 the victim was rushed by paramedics to harbor ucla medical center after the shooting which occurred about 12 40 p m on 227th street between halldale and denker avenues police said the boy was listed in critical condition
6933589 police said the family of the victim in tuesdays shooting was not from the harbor gateway neighborhood which is known for racial tensions between latino gangs and black residents other passengers inside the vehicle were a man and a woman and two other children ages 3 and 1 1 2
6933590 bratton did not say whether the suspects had ties to a specific gang but he noted that the neighborhood is home to the east side torrance gang
6933591 this is an area that is under the influence of a latino gang
6933592 you may recall that about a year or so ago the mayor and i were engaged in a major initiative up the street at 204th street where there had been the shooting death of a young black woman
6933593 bratton was referring to the killing of 14 year old cheryl green in december 2006 two members of the 204th street gang allegedly shot green as she stood talking with friends
6933594 the suspects were later caught and charged with murder along with a special hate crime allegation they are still awaiting trial
6933595 whats been particularly disturbing is the sensational nature of some of these incidents
6933596 it was people minding their own business thats what causes even more concern this wasnt a gang battle
6933597 the east side torrance and 204th street gangs are longtime rivals but they also are known for preying on black residents
6933598 every black person but in particular black males is a potential victim of est violence and intimidation
6933599 amanda f susskind pacific southwest regional director of the anti defamation league in los angeles said hate rhetoric is rising online and is particularly targeting youth perpetuated in part by as many as 110 white supremacist organizations nationwide
6933600 the rhetoric appears to be influencing other groups toma said he cited law enforcement reports that some latino gang members who targeted blacks in the harbor gateway area of los angeles were found with neo nazi material and some latino gangs were forming alliances with white supremacists in prisons to prey on blacks
6933601 second latino gang member arrested in murder of 14 year old black girl
6933602 over the course of the last two weeks we committed every resource to solving this crime
6933603 the family will never recover and the neighborhood has some serious wounds because of this
6933604 this reminds me of a really bad time in the history of this country
6933605 they circle the block and see if anybodys out and if there is they come back and start shooting
6933606 choose sides either be with us and have all the perks of white racist supremacy or choose to side with blacks and face the dire consequences

6933617 for the department the issue comes down to gas for the fop and the officer on the street it comes down to public safety
6933618 the kennels are not good for the dogs they are loud the dogs are agitated they get very little sleep and as a result that impacts their ability to do their work
6933619 if its not something that is best suited for the dog they have the option of kenneling the dog until we can come up with a viable option to do so
6933620 its just become such an institution that i think people want to come just to experience it
6933621 significant political leaders in the state to support me in my primary campaign and im forever grateful

6933624 i was quite shocked at the level of corruption that is inside that department
6933625 this agency fully cooperated with the court and lovejoys attorney
6933626 we are proud of our investigation and our policies against animal abuse amp neglect and we have no intention of changing our stance
6933627 im not one to make a quick decision until we can really understand everything thats happened
6933628 this is so fresh we need to make sure that were making the right decisions
6933629 i certainly got an education of what its like to be in the defendants seat
6933630 and when people start putting lies on top of it to make it worse thats when i started having an issue
6933631 thats dangerous when you have a sheriff that only enforces the law for people that are going to get him some votes
6933632 i dont believe this stuff but i better learn what they are saying so i can pass the class
6933633 would a young person looking for an excuse to escape the accountability of god cling to the false conclusion that the origin of life problem is only a minor obstacle in the relentless march of evolutionary theory

6933636 we think this is a direct slap in the face to obama who is not telegraph savvy
6933637 obama is too out of touch with the american people especially the youngsters who are quite hep to the telegraph
6933638 there is going to be quite a surge of excited americans at the telegraph offices when i make my historic announcement it sure beats telling everyone who their next vice president will be by sending the announcement by pony express or driving around town in a maverick or pinto throwing flyers on doorsteps
6933639 speculation is running high that as soon as dick cheney tells mccain who his running mate will be that telegraph keys will be clacking all over the country
6933640 this bold move into new advanced technology should dispel any notion that i am old and behind the times
6933641 as it will bring all the conservatives and reagan democrats to the polls to vote for mccain
6933642 the choice of reagan is also a positive for mccain because he will look young and vigorous compared to reagan and he will look more attentive
6933643 i cant believe what those republicans will dig up to win this election
6933644 there is nothing in the constitution that says you have to be alive to be the vice president
6933645 i guess our founding fathers didnt think future generations would be so unscrupulous and so dumb

6933664 the us money supply has experienced the sharpest contraction in modern history heightening the risk of a wall street crunch and a severe economic slowdown in coming months
6933665 monthly data for july show that the broad money growth has almost collapsed
6933666 the overall debt burden in the us economy is currently at record levels raising concerns that a recession if it occurs could set off a sharp downward spiral
6933667 the biggest one month fall since modern records began in 1959 the process is accelerating and will require the fed to slash rates at its september meeting
6933668 over time inflation will be the last problem that the fed will have to face as a severe us recession and global slowdown will lead to a sharp reduction in inflationary pressures in the u s slack in goods markets with demand falling below supply will reduce pricing power of firms slack in labor markets with unemployment rising will reduce wage pressures and labor costs pressures a fall in commodity prices of the order of 30 will further reduce inflationary pressure the fed will have to cut the fed funds rate much more as severe downside risks to growth and to financial stability will dominate any short term upward inflationary pressures leaving aside the risk of a collapse of the us dollar given this easier monetary policy the fed funds rate may end up being closer to 0 than 1 by the end of this financial crisis and severe recession cycle
6933669 recent government statistics show that only between 10 and 20 of the rebate dollars were spent the rebates added nearly 80 billion to the permanent national debt but less than 20 billion to consumer spending here are the facts tax rebates of 78 billion arrived in the second quarter of the year the governments recent gdp figures show that the level of consumer outlays only rose by an extra 12 billion or 15 of the lost revenue the rest went into savings including the paydown of debt consumer outlays increased to 36 billion from 24 billion so the additional 12 billion of consumer spending was less than 16 of the extra 76 billion of disposable personal income by comparison savings rose by 62 billion or five times as much this experience confirms earlier studies showing that one time tax rebates are not a cost effective way to increase economic activity
6933670 the recent plunge in m3 ed m3 is the broadest measure of money used by economists to estimate the entire supply of money makes it likely that credit lines have been fully tapped and or banks have simply turned off the spigot liquidity shrinks by the day banks scrambling to refinance long term debt are going to have a very tough go of it weekly unemployment claims are soaring consumers out of a job are going to have a tough time paying bills those looking for a bottom in these conditions are simply barking up the wrong tree
6933671 the problem began in the roaring twenties when the fed made money plentiful by keeping interest rates low money seemed to be plentiful but what was actually flowing freely was credit or debt production was up more than wages so more goods were available than money to pay for them but people could borrow money was so easy to get that people were borrowing just to invest taking out short term low interest loans that were readily available from the banks
6933672 the fed began selling securities in the open market reducing the money supply by reducing the reserves available for backing loans the result was a huge liquidity squeeze a lack of available money short term loans suddenly became available only at much higher interest rates making buying stock on margin much less attractive as fewer people bought stock prices fell removing the incentive for new buyers to purchase stocks bought by earlier buyers on margin the stock market crashed overnight
6933673 the federal reserve definitely caused the great depression by contracting the amount of currency in circulation by one third from 1929 to 1933
6933674 the financial system has been turned over to a purely profiteering group the system is private conducted for the sole purpose of obtaining the greatest possible profits from the use of other peoples money

6933684 we have been seeing about 30 cases of cancer of the cervix per year and that has been constant now
6933685 arcisil prevents the development of the precursors to cervical cancer in other words it prevents women from developing cervical cancer it immunises her against the human papiloma virus
6933686 the overall effect of the vaccines on cervical cancer remains unknown
6933687 the real impact of hpv vaccination on cervical cancer will not be observable for decades
6933688 there are no easy answers but there are simple answers we must have the courage to do what we know is morally right
6933689 one of the sad signs of our times is that we have demonized those who produce subsidized those who refuse to produce and canonized those who complain

6933768 i told im to wait in the parlor but id be appy to show im the door if you want
6933769 no maam wont give is name and says ell only speak to you right irregular if you ask me shall i turn im out
6933770 i am surprised lily what makes this gentleman so objectionable
6933771 i will keep your words in mind lily but i may as well see what business he thinks he has here stranger things have happened than snake oil salesmen with honest intentions
6933772 sir i am mrs longhurst my maid tells me you have business here might i have the pleasure of your name sir i am unaccustomed to unannounced guests
6933773 well mr yardley if it is business that brings you here i suggest you wait until my husband returns from dover he should be back within the week i would be more than happy to wire a message to him and arrange an appointment
6933774 lily will you please adjourn to the kitchen ill ring for you if you are needed
6933775 that is quite unimportant mrs longhurst what is important is that i do have it i take you do recognize your beloved husband even though im sure that was taken a few years ago
6933776 of course you do or you wouldnt have sent the girl away
6933777 im sure scotland yard would be very interest in this photograph dont you agree why there are four of the crew of a fearsome pirate vessel shown in this photograph i believe it is my patriotic duty to turn it over to their capable hands
6933778 pay me a stipend each month and ill make sure this photograph
6933779 oh you have a choice but i doubt you would enjoy the alternative scotland yard would undoubtedly call in her majestys navy and they would descend upon your house to arrest your husband your house and all your lovely lovely treasures would be confiscated on the other hand i doubt my stipend will make much of a dent in your wealth mrs longhurst
6933780 enough to ensure i live in comfort madam one hundred pounds a month
6933781 and perhaps some of the treasures your husband has procured on his ahem business trips i do have a fondness for items of artistic value
6933782 i assume you will be wanting to leave today with your first stipend
6933783 you certainly are quick your husband must be grateful to have such a clever woman as his wife
6933784 ill take quid or sovereigns doesnt matter to me i do rather like the clinking of sovereigns though makes a man truly feel like hes got something to spend
6933785 i do not have one hundred pounds at the moment mr yardley i will have to visit the bank to procure your money as for the rest of your request
6933786 if you wish to follow me i will allow you to chose something from my husbands study his most recent acquisitions are likely to be worth more than your price and perhaps you will accept one in lieu of money
6933787 very well but if you try to take anything else i will ring for the valet who is from africa and quite fearsome
6933788 i show you this only because you leave me little choice
6933789 my husbands true study is down here be careful mr yardley the stairs are narrow
6933790 choose any one item mr yardley im sure you will find your stipend to be unnecessary
6933791 i do not know where you acquired that photograph but you are a fool for trying to blackmail me my husband is not the only member of our household ever to fly on the typhon
6933792 micah and i have worked too hard for this house for this life to have a rat like yourself put us in jeopardy

6933803 i i am in love i am in love with a woman who wakes every day with a smile in my heart placed more gracefully than my fingers can fly a smile that turns to find me watching sometimes wistfully sometimes wontonly meets me in that charged space between where restless desire meets conviction and makes storms of us all eyes that see the heat of summer days in chicago cool nights in europe and the comfort of warm covers defending against cold mornings and the weight of the weekday reflect mischief creation adventure inspiration i am in love with a woman who has touched me with kindness and confidence pushed me to pursue rather than accept has shown me that chaos and balance fight not as enemies but as lovers and has let balance have some spotlight for now who has startled my staunch cynacism with hope and truth and disassembled my defenses with dizzying ease and joy i am in love with this woman and i can think of no more appropriate way to repay her than by saying magdalene magdalene will you marry me

6933827 for nearly 100 years hallmark has believed in the very best of human nature
6933828 hallmark is jeopardizing its brand as a family friendly company customers used to be able to trust hallmark to produce quality products that were safe for all ages now parents will need to steer their kids from hallmarks section of the greeting card aisle and away from its previously heartwarming movies for fear that they too will push homosexual messages
6933829 by latching onto the latest fad generated by the homosexual special interest groups hallmark is negating its image as a wholesome company that promotes american values and pro family principles in its products american businesses have a corporate responsibility to the public that buys their products instead of bolstering campaigns by special interest groups like the homosexual activists corporations like hallmark should be protecting american culture from those forces that would destroy the family and create a public environment that is detrimental to general well being especially childrens well being

6933915 amos avula of ywam who was earlier targeted by the extremists was questioned and allowed to return home
6933916 however police arrested satyanarayan rao and another believer identified only as n t murti they were released on bail on august 16 at 4 30 p m
6933917 gowda and kumara were released on bail on august 13 at 6 15 p m
6933918 he had swollen arms legs and face from the extremists attack and was admitted to a private nursing home for treatment
6933919 with gcics intervention a first information report was registered against the extremists
6933920 around 5 30 p m mrs samuel called for an emergency parent teachers association pta meeting
6933921 wherein with gcic support she apprised the pta of the extremists attacks and demands on the school the pta pledged their support to the christian institution and took a resolution not to give in to the extremists
6933922 the extremists flung chairs at the congregation causing serious head injury to a 4 year old child identified only as priyanka and four believers also suffered minor injuries
6933923 the extremists filed a complaint against durgappa but with the intervention of the gcic durgappa and his family were allowed to leave the police station around 10 30 p m and all the charges were dropped

6933929 not in compliance with the ceasefire and that russia needs to come into compliance now
6933930 we havent seen that yet its my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
6933931 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
6933932 should go back to the situation before the hostilities started
6933933 the idea is that yes for a temporary period some russian peace forces could stay on next to the border line of ossetia but its temporary it should be for patrolling and it should be until we have an international mechanism
6933934 it was clearly stated that this presence first has to be through patrolling no fixed presence and second should not have an effect on the freedom of movement on roads and trains in this place
6933935 the road gets a little steeper during the second half of the foundations existence
6933936 but were optimistic and on course it will be a great innovation if we accomplish nothing more than giving parents and child care providers a common evaluation system that will drive more early learning and good outcomes low income and immigrant families have oversubscribed on the pilot programs in the targeted areas i believe well raise the rest of the money and deliver on our promises
6933937 in 1972 there were three times as many minnesota kids in kindergarten through 12th grade as there were retirees
6933938 i hope this can be a model well be able to tell the policymakers that we think these are the ways to increase parent involvement and how to get more kids ready for school we think that 80 to 90 percent of kids can be ready for kindergarten
6933939 im pretty confident that melf is going to contribute greatly
6933940 and they lend a rational voice to the discussion melf brings together some agencies and groups that havent worked together previously

6933942 our local vets have supported the moraine emergency clinic for years and i anticipate that our local vets will still refer cases there for overnight care thankfully dayton is big enough to support two clinics
6933943 we are here when regular vets are closed we consider ourselves an extension of the regular veterinarians practice
6933944 we looked at the dec as someone weve worked with but our feeling is that its an older practice in an older area of town we provide a little different services dayton care center is designed for the more complicated cases

6933953 not having a major fault is not a reason not to worry about earthquakes
6933954 instead of having a single major fault or a few major faults we tend to have a lot of very minor and sort of subtle faults
6933955 its a family of faults and that can contribute to the severity of an earthquake

6933958 bahwa seorang wanita berpapasan dengannya dan bau wewangian parfum menerpanya
6933959 siapa saja perempuan yang memakai minyak wangi kemudian ia keluar lalu ia melewati suatu kaum orang banyak supaya mereka mendapati mencium baunya maka dia itu adalah perempuan zina tuna susila
6933960 yang demikian itu disebut berzina karena wangi wangian yang dikenakan wanita dapat membangkitkan syahwat laki laki dan menarik perhatian mereka
6933961 jika hal itu memakai wewangian saja diharamkan bagi wanita yang hendak keluar masjid lalu apa hukumnya bagi yang hendak menuju pasar atau tempat keramaian lainnya

6933967 when i graduated from that place i didnt envision myself standing up there talking to a group of graduates 13 years later but ive been blessed its been an awesome ride
6933968 never in a million years would i have thought i would be leaving minnesota after only one year
6933969 i was extremely happy there now im a fan of the minnesota vikings
6933970 but im so used to it it doesnt bother me its a nonissue
6933971 hes a very good communicator and i thought he had a good way about him
6933972 he was bright eyed he had a great sense of humor a good laugh he wasnt stiff he was a guy that you knew related well to his players
6933973 day in and day out he comes into that meeting room and hes ready to coach football ready get after it as a player you feed off of that hes a guy you can follow because hes such a great leader
6933974 when i heard i got the job it was kind of numbing kind of surreal
6933975 but then immediately i transitioned into brainstorming about the many things that i had to do it was daunting but such is the case in the national football league if youre overwhelmed by it then probably youre out of place
6933976 thats one of the things i appreciated in minnesota just seeing the things brad went through as a new head coach
6933977 i have a great deal of admiration for his resolve for how he had a vision for how he wanted to do things and he stuck to it
6933978 we were 10 6 0 1 in the playoffs thats how were judged
6933979 i really patterned it after a pregame speech in that the game theyre about to play is the game of life
6933980 i said were about to burst open the doors and go out and compete i wanted to encourage them i wanted to reassure them that they are prepared for the game they have all the tools that it needs to be successful
6933981 the bicycle is carrying the sack of potatoes i am glad that i do not have to carry them on my back
6933982 you are a smart boy when you grow old you will not walk hunched over like i do
6933983 i love to watch the trees and fields pass by as i roll down the path
6933984 when i ride my bicycle i am content to chant nam myoho renge kyo
6933985 your mind will roll with the ease of a newly trued wheel
6933986 riding my bicycle i live in harmony with all sentient beings
6933987 you are riding on the golden path of non harming
6933988 some of those darned bicyclers have no respect for the law
6933989 i dont think they should even call it beach volleyball anymore
6933990 because its really sand volleyball beaches no longer come into play
6933991 god bless u but i am a little older than that
6933992 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6933993 we walked up kind of sort of close to it within about 8 or 9 feet up to that point it seemed excited but not really agitated
6933994 we had heard stories of these things because they are such a powerful bird such a big bird with big claws and stuff could possible hurt us so we were a little concerned about that
6933995 i think we had exhausted the fact that we werent going to be able to just corral it up on our own without harming it
6933996 i guess the point was made well what do we have other than shooting it with an actual gun to get rid of it
6933997 my wife and i went to visit her in doggy jail this morning
6933998 we were very pleased theyre taking very good care of her
6933999 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6934000 obviously we in canada have understood over the past several years how difficult this mission is
6934001 theres no sense in reading about it because its basically the same story they were just in the wrong place at the wrong time they were attacked theyre blown up i think weve gotten used to it unfortunately
6934002 there were about three or four war veterans and there were a lot of young people
6934003 i dont think were getting accustomed to seeing soldiers die there were 100 people on the bridge i left after a while and every bridge all the way home had a 100 people on it its a sign of how special each one of these people are
6934004 there will be a lot of attention but i dont think it will cause a change in policy
6934005 its as tragic at 99 as it is at 101
6934006 heres a u n sanctioned mission carried out by nato and you still have people referring to it as bushs war and were the lackeys of the americans
6934007 thats just knee jerk anti american anti bush rhetoric it has legs it sticks it really does when im out taking questions after a speech thats the type of stuff i get from some people
6934008 at least were living up to our obligations within nato
6934009 it defies belief that we are actually making progress when our aid people have to pull out because it is so dangerous for them
6934010 i think a lot of people have just tuned out because theres no longer political conflict about it

6934018 they came out swinging the bats they hit the ball all over the park and out of it
6934019 you know its good to hit a grand slam but i would rather it have been against somebody else
6934020 because neal and i go way back i consider him a friend i have to do my job too but if i could choose someone else i would
6934021 i walked the first guy and put us in a bigger jam than we were already in i put one over the plate and he harris put a good swing on it
6934022 he looks pretty good over there today he swung the bat well
6934023 i know im strong enough to hit the ball out of the park but im not up there trying to hit the ball out of the park
6934024 i dont know where its coming from and im not trying to figure it out

6934039 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6934040 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
6934041 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6934042 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6934043 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6934044 im sure hell make a wonderful choice for our party and for our country and well just have to wait until next friday to find out the answer to those questions
6934045 this ruling is good news for washingtons medical marijuana patients it means that the federal government cannot interfere with a states ability to implement its own medical marijuana law and it affirms the importance of the 10th amendment of the constitution which guarantees every state the right to make and repeal its own laws
6934046 our guidance continues to assume the hardware price cut we talked about at the very beginning of the year assuming there is about a 50 price cut on both the xbox 360 and ps3 going into the holiday season

6934050 expects russia to abide by its agreement to withdraw forces
6934051 the two agreed that russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
6934052 we havent seen that yet its my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
6934053 have without a doubt failed to live up to their obligations
6934054 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
6934055 they are erasing this village from the face of earth so that ossetians would come here
6934056 the decision was taken after assessment of the presentation as well as the information available from a number of other security reports including one from the south african government
6934057 this was a difficult decision but it was the right one there is nothing more important than the safety of our national team
6934058 we appreciate all the efforts of the icc task team the pakistan cricket board the pakistan authorities and the security consultants the players are naturally disappointed for their fans and the people of pakistan that they will not have a chance to see them in action in that country in september
6934059 after extensive discussions and frank exchange of views the board resolved not to send our team at this time to pakistan we respect the right of the pakistan cricket board to stage the tournament and we would urge the icc to reschedule the tournament as soon as possible
6934060 not in compliance with the ceasefire and that russia needs to come into compliance now
6934061 we havent seen that yet its my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
6934062 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
6934063 should go back to the situation before the hostilities started
6934064 the idea is that yes for a temporary period some russian peace forces could stay on next to the border line of ossetia but its temporary it should be for patrolling and it should be until we have an international mechanism
6934065 it was clearly stated that this presence first has to be through patrolling no fixed presence and second should not have an effect on the freedom of movement on roads and trains in this place
6934066 i want one of you to die and i want to make you go crazy and then he said i will kill you
6934067 the video shows that the plane caught fire only after it hit the ground
6934068 the fault fixed by spanairs maintenance technicians could not have had an influence on the crash
6934069 there was more than one cause an engine was not the cause of the accident
6934070 everything we did with the aircraft was by the rules
6934071 eric look we bought a huge bottle of vodka for the plane ride every time someone talked on the intercom we took a shot we are soooo drunk right
6934072 eric this will be so much fun im looking forward to the bus ride
6934073 you realize that these arent the nicest buses the roads are extremely difficult to navigate there is no bathroom on board and you will be sitting next to some guy who probably smells like his butt hole right
6934074 im a compulsive liar plus youre annoying the crap out of me so im going to do whatever i can to return the favor
6934075 not in compliance with the ceasefire and that russia needs to come into compliance now
6934076 we havent seen that yet its my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
6934077 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
6934078 should go back to the situation before the hostilities started

6934089 normally in the pitched tabloid battle for exclusives losing a competitive bombshell like the mccain scandal would send perel into fits not this time five enquirer reporters had spent more than a month in 2007 chasing down the same rumors but failed to uncover any documentary evidence
6934090 this not only raises concerns of consumer fraud but also public health
6934091 a person could have allergies to a certain species and if its mislabelled that could have dangerous consequences
6934092 consumers may think they are doing the right thing for the environment by buying a certain type of fish that is eco friendly when really they could actually still be buying exploited species
6934093 weekly shonen sunday launched the 50th anniversary of takahashi amp
6934094 it is not just for kids i do not see the futility
6934095 the bright critics assembled in this volume will doubtless show in
6934096 from a footballing point of view he possesses many of the attributes i like in a player
6934097 just having michael in training with us for the last few days gives everyone a boost
6934098 its the first time that new signings fabricio coloccini danny guthrie or jonas gutierrez have really seen what it is like to play with michael it gives everyone a boost
6934099 he owen has trained with us for the last two days and i am going to put him on the bench so thats a big step forward
6934100 we took fabrice muamba so we cant just sign every single player we would like to sign
6934101 we signed fab which has made us a bit stronger in midfield and he adds to what was already a strong pool of midfield players that weve got
6934102 thats why we didnt go any further with that but danny did a great job for this football club last year hes a great lad and we wish him all the best up at newcastle
6934103 it was all about kevin on that day and we were just bit part players that honeymoon period will have gone now and kevin will be aware of that
6934104 they got a fantastic start last week by going to manchester united and getting a point when nobody including myself thought that might happen
6934105 theyll be buoyed by that but theyll also be buoyed by the fact there will be a full house there and its a fantastic place to play football anyway
6934106 there will be three players making their home debuts fabricio coloccini jonas guttierez and guthrie so it will be a huge test for us but thats what its all about going to these places and trying to get results
6934107 theyve got a lot of good qualities they looked fit organised theres a lot of pace in there and ability
6934108 but they scored from a set piece against united and that is what were looking to do win in all different manners
6934109 if its a running game we want to run stronger and faster than the opposition if its about set pieces we can score off them if its shots from distance we can do that
6934110 the bottom line with blackburn is that they have a front line some of the top premier league clubs would be envious of
6934111 of course they are talking big big money for roque santa cruz
6934112 but jason roberts has been in the premier league a long time now and he knows the situation benni mccarthy was their top scorer last year and couldnt get in the team last week and matt derbyshire is an england under 21 international who played here at the kc this week
6934113 so they really have a strike force to be reckoned with and we have to make sure we take care of that
6934114 but when we go forward we have to show what we can do too
6934115 not just because of the lancashire against yorkshire thing but because blackburn are renowned at ewood park for getting points because of their battling qualities
6934116 there is no way we can take the game easy this is going to be a tough game
6934117 george is a slight doubt because he put his body on the line against fulham and showed how much commitment is needed for an individual never mind the collective
6934118 he went through the wars was almost carried off twice and thats testament to the commitment he showed us
6934119 people are brought in for a reason and it is down to me to work as hard as i possibly can i feel im in good shape and when i get the chance im ready to take it
6934120 if george is injured im ready but i dont want to rely on people getting injured to get into the team
6934121 i want to be there on merit but if it comes because someone is out then its up to me to keep them out of team
6934122 im hoping to do at least one transfer before the end of the window but if i could get two it would give us a bit more security
6934123 but i would prefer to take in players that are tried and trusted rather than a loan thats tipped as one for the future and im not sure about unless its coming from a source that i have great respect for
6934124 these are two really big games for us coming up
6934125 if we can get the right result against bristol city it really sets it up nicely for the newcastle game
6934126 they always bring a lot of supporters and i am sure all of our fans will want to see the ricoh as close to capacity as possible
6934127 my match fitness is already coming back i played a small part in the barnsley and aldershot games and have played some reserve football too
6934128 ive had no reaction to either problem and the medical staff are so good that i have 100 confidence that i wont have a problem
6934129 i feel ready and really want to work my way back into the team
6934130 we are very solid its true and just think that almost all of the defence is out
6934131 last year we also conceded few goals we always had the best defence
6934132 i hope all the goalscorers get their tally up and running lets hope over the next few weeks they have all scored as well as the midfield players who did so well in threatening the goal last season
6934133 ive got no doubts that ishmaels goals will come if he continues to work as hard as he does and ive sensed an extra edge on him this pre season
6934134 he is hungry to show the world that he is a premier league striker
6934135 how does he do that by scoring goals by threatening the opposition every week which is a great positive for us lets hope his tally starts because confidence is a great thing with strikers
6934136 he needs to see the goalscoring charts start ticking along soon
6934137 ishmael has come from manchester city where he never really had many regular opportunities he had bits and pieces of action i think he feels he has pushed himself to the front of our list of strikers but to maintain that he has got to keep producing
6934138 he has got to retain that hunger he is showing it is down to him it comes from within you have a desire to push on and show how good you are as a footballer
6934139 you need the opportunity but his career is progressing very rapidly
6934140 everton finished fifth in the premier league last year and that is no mean feat that is a fantastic achievement we know how tough the game is going to be
6934141 they finished fifth probably because they won enough games away from home against sides outside of the top four they will see us as an opportunity to get their season up and rolling having lost to blackburn last week
6934142 i dont buy into this club on the decline theyve signed no players what is going on at everton stuff
6934143 they might have lost andy johnson but the rest of it is the players who finished fifth
6934144 yes theyve got tim cahill injured but we had robert koren and luke moore injured people have injuries that is what football is like we are expecting a very tough game
6934145 we have got to make sure we are ready for that challenge and try to impose our style on the game get up and running and get some points on the board early if we can
6934146 you want to try and get off to a decent start like hull did in front of their own fans last weekend
6934147 lewis is powerful and commanding as charlie crews he brings an intensity to the screen that portrays a man divided
6934148 i kept thinking about everything i had done to get into the national squad it was as if a film flashed in front of my eyes i do not know what to say
6934149 i returned to brazil to make my dream come true despite better financial offers in europe i had never been called up to play with the selecao and achieving that while playing for flamengo is very important
6934150 it the foul on griffiths was outside the box i think everybody saw that was clear
6934151 i think every time we get this referee we just have a bit of bad luck you know so thats unfortunate
6934152 i wasnt in charge then since ive been in charge anyway i wont say it i wont get myself into trouble i cant afford a fine we are not allowed to say anything
6934153 i dont know where the four minutes of stoppage time came from and then he stopped time for the last minute
6934154 the players are gutted they all felt where did the four minutes come from and then it extended it felt like six minutes in the end where that came from we dont know bitterly disappointed
6934155 weve picked up a point it should have been three theres no denying that fact and i think newcastle found themselves very lucky today
6934156 realistically after the first half the game should have been dead and buried we should have capitalised on our opportunities and been more ruthless in front of goal
6934157 but it tends to be a situation that when you are not ruthless in front of goal and you dont go on with it you invite the other team back in and thats exactly what we did
6934158 we just need to have a bit more of an awareness
6934159 it is difficult to imagine a more archetypal instance of the press informing the public of government operations through government records than ostergrens posting of public records to demonstrate the lack of care being taken by the government to protect the private information of individuals
6934160 in the end it appears this law was passed not for the purpose of protecting social security numbers but to silence a critic of the states failure to protect such numbers from identity thieves
6934161 what if somebody got up and said you were a murderer
6934162 our innovative litigation was aimed at holding accountable the small percentage of gun dealers who break the law and it has worked
6934163 affiliate marketing what is affiliate marketing it is simply a form of internet marketing that rewards the affiliates for driving traffic to the advertiser or for other transactions
6934164 i should respectfully like to apply for membership in the above club
6934165 they have really made a difference their support helps ease the heart and ease the mind
6934166 once we knew about serena and amy the first thing our club did was pass around the hat for money
6934167 well be there with them every step of the way
6934168 the little necessities you take for granted like even a pizza cutter are the things you dont think about getting it quickly reminds you of what you dont have
6934169 im focusing on the good rather than the bad im still here and relatively healthy
6934170 my club has been so generous with their support and time
6934171 they have been like a second family to me and my family
6934172 the way they have come together to contribute their time to help us rebuild has been fabulous i would not be as strong as i am now without them
6934173 we will rebuild faith hope and love have given me strength i have all of those with rotary
6934174 if everyone can give a little we can accomplish a lot
6934175 dazu kann m ntefering einen beitrag leisten er ist aufgrund seiner politischen lebensleistung ein anerkannter und glaubw rdiger politiker
6934176 der auftritt von m ntefering in bayern ist ein ganz normaler vorgang wir sind beide langj hrige politische freunde seine wahlkampf unterst tzung ist ein erfreulicher aber eigentlich selbstverst ndlicher akt der freundschaft und der kollegialit t mehr aber auch nicht
6934177 die spd ist f r die b rger eine gesamtmarke davon kann man sich als landesverband nie ganz abkoppeln
6934178 trotz aller begleitmusik aus anderen l ndern glaube ich dass die menschen wissen es geht hier allein um die zukunft bayerns da z hlen nur bayerische themen und auch bayerische pers nlichkeiten ein erfolg wird unserer sein und ein misserfolg ebenso
6934179 es ist m glich dass die csu unter die absolute mehrheit f llt
6934180 deshalb greift sie zu alten angstparolen sie spricht davon dass nur ein csu w hler ein anst ndiger bayer sei und jetzt warnt sie auch noch vor h lle und satan das wird ihr mehr schaden als nutzen die bayern sind aufgekl rte leute die genau wissen was sie an ihrer spd haben
6934181 within one week we established a haiti emergency response team and had involved all 15 haitian rotary clubs approximately 300 rotarians working under the guidance of the assistant governors a haiti task force past district governors and our district disaster relief chair
6934182 we know that the situation because of the global economy and the increased cost of the commodities will only get worse so we have embarked on a program to develop sustainable agricultural projects throughout the country through microcredit initiatives
6934183 its not like we are wealthy people but theyll kidnap you for a watch everyone is living in fear
6934184 before they only kidnapped key well known economically successful people like industrialists and landowners now they are kidnapping people from the middle class
6934185 they are a prime target because theyve got money and theyve got a worry and you can combine those two and offer them a false sense of security which is exactly what this is
6934186 if the petermann glacier breaks up back to the upstream rift the loss would be as much as 60 square miles 160 square km
6934187 if i could be there the whole summer i would but obviously its very almond resorts offers a best friend getaway weekend to relax
6934188 eh puro kasinungalingan lang naman ang nakasulat dyan bakit ko pa babasahin
6934189 what is written there are all lies so why should i bother
6934190 once i understood the issues behind that terrible number i knew what i needed to do
6934191 in 2008 09 i will ask you all to make dreams real for the worlds children
6934192 this will be our theme and my challenge to all of you
6934193 children are killed by illnesses that become deadly in combination with poor sanitation and malnutrition
6934194 its a cycle that is not interrupted because there is no access to education
6934195 we will bring clean water to their communities and create sanitation projects that keep children healthy
6934196 make dreams real will be an easy theme to sell around the world we all like challenges lee has allowed us to put our dreams to practice
6934197 so much more can be done with just a little more a trained birth attendant a simple clinic a school feeding program a visiting nurse
6934198 these are simple and direct ways to save childrens lives
6934199 children die not because nobody can help them but because too often nobody does but you and i here in this room are rotarians and helping is what we do best
6934200 our job is to make dreams real for children if every one of us does this at the end of our year we will all have achieved something wonderful
6934201 has dreampt about the real issues in our community i e issues related to children it is now the responsibility of all the rotarians to make our ri presidents dreams real by focussing our efforts in each of these areas on children
6934202 in the name of paul harris lets build a world of peace and make our world a better world were written as a plea to help save and protect the children of the world
6934203 to open their eyes to the needs of children in communities near and far
6934204 i thought that if my district had an exhibit it would be great public relations
6934205 it would let people know what rotary is and it would be a great way to recruit new members
6934206 the more exposure rotary has the better it will be in the long run for membership
6934207 i caught a glimpse of children in class everything their chairs tables was very used of poor quality
6934208 that moment created my desire to make a difference with schools
6934209 a powerful theme which is the wish of all to make their dreams a reality
6934210 based on anecdotal evidence alone the consensus was that rotary had an aggressive training schedule and that it was a tremendous burden on participants we were pleasantly surprised by the results of this survey
6934211 because of the size of our district we offer lets talk rotary sessions in various parts of the district these sessions which include foundation and membership topics are extremely popular because were taking rotary training to the clubs rather than expecting the clubs to come to the training

6934239 some lessons cant be taught elektra they must be lived to be understood

6934242 there is in every true womans heart a spark of heavenly fire which lies dormant in the broad daylight of prosperity but which kindles up and beams and blazes in the dark hour of adversity
6934243 youre used to being a winner youre not really a leader until youve lost
6934244 the only man i know who behaves sensibly is my tailor he takes my measurements anew each time he sees me the rest go on with their old measurements and expect me to fit them
6934245 both halves of community property receive a stepped up basis when one spouse dies
6934246 in community property states this includes both spouses property held in an ab trust
6934247 over the years i have developed a picture of what a human being living humanely is like she is a person who understand values and develops her body finding it beautiful and useful a person who is real and is willing to take risks to be creative to manifest competence to change when the situation calls for it and to find ways to accommodate to what is new and different keeping that part of the old that is still useful and discarding what is not
6934248 we chose biotechnology as the topic for its lucrative nature across the globe
6934249 students arent always aware of opportunities that are out there or how to start a career process we thought the best way to help our youth was to incite them about their options even before they left college
6934250 our biotechnology seminar was a great example of rotarys commitment to our youth and their future
6934251 students walked in unsure but walked out confident in making early and realistic career decisions
6934252 students walked in unsure but walked out confident in making early and realistic career decisions
6934253 conflicts their management and resolution are essentially state driven exercises but this perception is changing
6934254 civil society is becoming a key actor in conflict prevention and resolution processes this meeting is certainly a significant step in this direction and i applaud rotary for this commendable initiative
6934255 we bring hope and we have been doing this for more than one hundred years we shall continue practicing it as we start writing the second chapter of rotary history
6934256 you rotarians are leaders and role models in your municipalities
6934257 just by changing your actions you have the power to be an example to others by doing something that seemed impossible you show that we can dream and that change is possible

6934260 he and the embassy staff are very involved with the project
6934261 were a fortunate club we have 60 or so honorary members who are ambassadors it is not unusual for us to have an ambassador to have a senior business or senior government leader speak to us
6934262 the response was particularly warm probably partly because he took off on the everyman theme the club really does operate that way theres a sense of equality among all members
6934263 must not feel that they are isolated must not feel that they are abandoned they must feel that the world cares about them encourages them and supports them
6934264 club leaders must use every tool available to get new members we try to connect members with rotary international as much as possible to educate inform and create stronger bonds rss is a great retention tool

6934266 nearly all of the hundreds of e mail telephone and face to face communications between rotarians in district 7630 and san marcos during the matching grant application process and water project construction were filtered through me
6934267 it was not that i asked to be the spokesperson but the communication difficulties posed by differences in language business practices and social expectations all demanded that someone keep the channels of communication open flowing and focused on a common objective
6934268 the positive impact of that service project is clearly evident in the happy faces of the san isidro community that at long last got clean water and latrines
6934269 my role with rotary as promoter translator facilitator and mentor has certainly improved my skills as a public speaker spanish speaker project administrator and teacher
6934270 it also embedded in me a rich web of support and fellowship that will be important to me for years to come

6934282 in the years since rotary international has started focusing on water as one of its annual service emphases weve learned just how much can be accomplished with relatively little how a single small water project perhaps a pump or a filter can change the life of a community
6934283 however our work has also included participation in many other major water projects
6934284 this is a historic opportunity to end polio in my former homeland and worldwide
6934285 we must remain committed until every child is protected against the tragic fatal consequences of this disease
6934286 things like service above self the object of rotary the four way test have added an incredible amount of quality to my life and i could not have lived the kind of life ive lived if it had not been for rotary and the principles that go along with it
6934287 we benefit the most so we must appreciate this contribution the more
6934288 and i could not have lived the kind of life ive lived if it had not been for rotary and the principles that go along with it

6934293 because the cost is suffered by the benchmark index itself it will remain hidden from index investors who simply focus on the explicit fees of index funds and their performance relative to the index yet it represents an unambiguous drag on returns and it can be avoided with simple index neutral strategies which have otherwise similar risk and return characteristics

6934299 new members will not join boring rotary clubs that just meet and eat
6934300 a new rotary club just like any rotarian needs four things to retain them in rotary fellowship an opportunity to make a meaningful contribution ongoing education and recognition
6934301 its such a wonderful experience to see this project come full circle and have it reach students that need these tools for prosperity
6934302 volunteering has to have a hands on element for it to grow and succeed
6934303 this is why we have been so successful for 12 years and why we will continue to be for years to come
6934304 some recent media reports have been misinterpreted as implying that oral polio vaccine has paralyzed 69 children in northern nigeria
6934305 in fact these children were paralyzed by a vaccine derived poliovirus to which they were vulnerable because they were not sufficiently vaccinated
6934306 this is a reflection of low vaccine coverage in this part of nigeria
6934307 the only solution is to step up our efforts to immunize all of nigerias children
6934308 it would be tragic if parents kept their children from receiving the vaccine based on unwarranted fears about its safety opv is the best most effective weapon we have to fight our real enemy the wild poliovirus
6934309 only opv is proven to rapidly provide very high immunity in the human gut and stop polio transmission in a tropical developing country setting
6934310 the cdc and the world health organization announced the cause of the polio outbreak last week even though they knew about it last year dr david heymann whos top polio official said that because the organization considered the outbreak a problem for scientists and not something that would change vaccination practices they thought it was unnecessary to immediately make it public
6934311 rotary will always continue programs that improve the health and well being of children
6934312 today more than 5 000 children are safe off the streets and have a future because rotarians care
6934313 i never thought the bread would turn out so tasty now this is my favorite class i like being able to see the results of our work so fast

6934321 a real little ship she was called at the meet last august
6934322 it was tedious and very frustrating we knew people were waiting
6934323 people lost everything they were living under tarps in the rain the living conditions were just horrible
6934324 people would help their neighbors it was a very humbling experience for us
6934325 finding the path to world peace and understanding is not a spectator sport it is fully participatory
6934326 mankind in the world as we know it cannot survive the continued use of war as a means of settling our disputes
6934327 the cost of failure will be borne by every man woman and child on this planet in some way either directly or indirectly
6934328 we truly live in a bloody and cruel world the statistics numb us
6934329 we need the continued financial support from rotary clubs and districts all over the world
6934330 someday one or more of our rotary peace fellows will be in the right place at the right time to make a really big difference and then rotarians everywhere will know our search for peace is working
6934331 i believe that high ethical standards in our business and private life are as important today as they were in the early days of rotary
6934332 yesterday you were thinking about today because then it was tomorrow now it is today and you are thinking about tomorrow and when the tomorrow comes it will become today because anything that exists exists here and now it cannot exist otherwise and if you have a fixed mode of functioning such that your mind always look at tomorrow then when will you live tomorrow never comes then you will go on missing the moment futute enters time enters you have missed and this becomes a fixed pattern robotlike you go on missing
6934333 this happens through our programs and having interfaith multicultural and ethical standards as guiding principles in all dealings
6934334 no divine right can be vested in anyone to pronounce the final word or the ultimate truth in matters of faith and religion prescriptive morality should be avoided as it often is the root cause of hostility and divisiveness
6934335 global ethics is based on an interfaith mind and ecumenical way of living

6934350 well thats too bad because i was going to ask if you could start supporting me so i could stop working all together and just sit at home and watch tv all day
6934351 mmmm what a turn on a man like that would be for me

6934365 na feira de 2006 o valor m dio de cr dito era de r 45 mil neste ano o volume m dio chegou a r 92 mil acreditamos que este aumento se deve ao pre o m dio dos im veis que tamb m cresceu e ao aquecimento do mercado imobili rio

6934426 this is the verdict light has come into the world but men loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil everyone who does evil hates the light and will not come into the light for fear that his deeds will be exposed but whoever lives by the truth comes into the light so that it may be seen plainly that what he has done has been done through god

6934661 every time our department gets special opportunities we have a chance to
6934662 the new associate seems to have different assets and experiences than were used to we can learn a fresh outsider perspective

6934666 we have two boilerplate formats for our reports to clients when we go into banks and find several ways we can help them we use the first format that report gives our findings and list of recommendations right up front but if we go into banks and cant find much wrong we dont have many recommendations for improvements and have charged them a big fee for the audit then we use the second boilerplate we begin the report with background on our company the credentials of our auditors the various audit procedures used and then we finally get around to the findings and recommendations

6934680 how can we open closed minds people who do not want to listen to any arguments or logic
6934681 lets let somebody else work out the bugs and then well see
6934682 that is a related issue all right the first thing however we need is
6934683 you have a point do you think that should be our primary criteria
6934684 how can we open closed minds people who do not want to listen to any arguments or logic
6934685 how can we open closed minds people who do not want to listen to any arguments or logic
6934686 what have i got to lose if i go along
6934687 im thrilled to be working with you again i can hardly wait to get started on the project were a perfect match
6934688 how can we open closed minds people who do not want to listen to any arguments or logic
6934689 i think we should attempt to get approval on this before its too late
6934690 after careful thought over the past month ive decided that
6934691 how can we open closed minds people who do not want to listen to any arguments or logic
6934692 but it is much more than we wanted to pay
6934693 we cant change that policy because people would get angry
6934694 the way we set our price is to determine x then y and then add 10 percent for z how did you set your budget figure for this service lets see if were on the same wavelength or if were comparing apples to oranges here
6934695 how can we open closed minds people who do not want to listen to any arguments or logic
6934696 a maintenance agreement on your copier is like an insurance policy on your automobile
6934697 that manager has been delinquent in dealing with safety issues
6934698 ferdinand has no ambition to move up in the company
6934699 how can we open closed minds people who do not want to listen to any arguments or logic
6934700 if i dont have all the facts why upset people ill just wait until i get all the facts have all the answers or work out the solution and then ill explain what happened and how we plan to handle it
6934701 well let you know if something becomes important so just dont worry about it
6934702 jeffrey gitomers sales moves plain talk makes sales fancy talk makes you sound lame
6934703 you skipped the part about x what about that it says here that you planned to cover that
6934704 were in this together to make our time together beneficial
6934705 turn to the person on your left and give a 30 second description of your part in the project
6934706 thats a good question carlita thanks for bringing up that issue anybody have experience with that kind of situation
6934707 michael how would you respond to that issue if it came up in your area
6934708 what are some of the changes you expect to see in the next six months
6934709 do you expect any pushback from clients on that policy
6934710 the marketing group says that it is too expensive for the number of leads generated the sales group loves the idea the regional managers are undecided so im bringing the idea directly to this committee what are your thoughts on our chances for success with this campaign
6934711 when you provide a specific topic outline you limit your flexibility if you decide to alter your timetable
6934712 to adjust to the interests of your group to accept new issues raised by the group or to accommodate other unexpected situations
6934713 if you think about it this is the trouble with most job search sites when you let everyone play nobody wins
6934714 i think people tend to want help when they are in the middle of a crisis
6934715 it will be interesting to see if consumers end up buying a technical service plan because any time you run into a problem it is actually cheaper to go that way or if they will wait until they are faced with a crash and then pay for the service
6934716 whether its a customer service agent or someone that is a representative of your company coming into someones home the demeanor how that person acts how helpful they are is a representation of your brand
6934717 if you havent trained those people and if you dont have quality control over how they approach problem solving it could leave you vulnerable
6934718 in the past a lot of the help was offered for free and now companies are realizing they are losing money by offering it free so they want to charge so i think there is a transition that is going to have to happen in the mind of consumers where paying for it is a trade off
6934719 the great thing about technology is that it offers so many features and functions now and the bad thing is that it offers so many new features and functions
6934720 it is a double edged sword with every feature and function that companies offer it also adds a layer of complexity in either set up or use or fix
6934721 how can we open closed minds people who do not want to listen to any arguments or logic
6934722 developing persuasive proposals that win big contracts nine common mistakes that may cost you mega money
6934723 you cant just go anywhere at any time you like
6934724 youre going to be wearing an ankle sensor to allow the parole officer to monitor your whereabouts youll be allowed to leave your house between 7 a m and 6 p m for work but other than that youll have only a small window of opportunity to leave your house do you understand
6934725 weve won some of the biggest states in the country we have won primaries in the west the south the midwest and the north east and although ive never minded the role of the underdog and have relished as much as anyone come from behind wins tonight i think we must get used to the idea that we are the republican party front runner
6934726 i think there are some people who thought it was all going to be done tonight but its not all done tonight were going to keep on battling were going to go all the way to the convention were going to win this thing and were going to get in to the white house
6934727 you know over the past few days a lot of people have been trying to say that this is a two man race well you know what it is and were in it
6934728 together were going to take back america because i see an america where our economy works for everyone not just those at the top where prosperity is shared and we create good jobs that stay right here in america the race will drag on for weeks longer this is not going to be decided any time in the near future as far as we can see
6934729 there is one thing on this february night that we do need the final results to know our time has come our movement is real and change is coming to america
6934730 both clinton and obama had a great day but given the expectation of momentum the hillary camp has slightly more reason to be happy
6934731 its a bad night to be mitt romney he doesnt have a signature win and he really needed california and it didnt come through it appears john mccain pretty much has the nomination sown up but he needs to find a way to generate enthusiasm
6934732 for all of their pandering to conservatives and evangelicals john mccain and mitt romney have been unable to shake off mike huckabee huckabees victories in alabama arkansas west virginia and strong showings in georgia and missouri prove that his message resonates with voters in southern states and rural districts across the country huckabee has the cache with these voters that mccain and romney have desperately sought to develop
6934733 so can you comment on obamas style what is it that makes him so charismatic as a speaker lets hear your analysis when we come back after the break
6934734 johnny how many times do i have to tell you not to leave your bike in the driveway
6934735 melihat michael berlatih bersama kami dalam beberapa hari terakhir merupakan sebuah suntikan semangat bagi siapapun
6934736 dia sudah latihan dengan kami selama dua hari terakhir dan saya menaruhnya di bangku cadangan jadi ini adalah langkah yang besar
6934737 dia fit dan bahkan mencetak gol saat latihan michael bukan lelaki yang membutuhkan banyak hal untuk sehat
6934738 by the letter of the law not the whim of the gavel
6934739 some have said they dont mind paying higher taxes i welcome their enthusiasm the irs accepts both checks and money orders
6934740 what a crazy customer suing for one pair of pants are they made of gold
6934741 from factory floor to the c suite manufacturing good communication in an industry of glitches
6934742 weve had a congress thats spent money like john edwards at a beauty shop
6934743 we lost it because we in the republican party came to washington to change government and government changed us we spent money like a drunken sailor although i never knew a sailor drunk or sober with the imagination of my colleagues
6934744 i think rudy mcromney wouldnt make a bad ticket and i kind of like the order
6934745 ill give you another 30 seconds to answer my question
6934746 and weve shuffled something into a solution or at least into perspective
6934747 my mother would laugh at the irony of this situation
6934748 ive never been prouder as a father to see my daughter huddled in that bathtub not praying for our safety but concerned for somebody else
6934749 dont ask me why we didnt hire more people to start with i knew better
6934750 well i was only reacting to what you said earlier about not having sufficient budget
6934751 just tell me what you want me to do now and ill get on it
6934752 the contract did not really call for an august 1 deadline you as manager selected that date was your intention to test our commitment to force us to abandon our quality procedures
6934753 you know the reason youre feeling that way is that youre insecure within yourself
6934754 we will lose the business if we miss that first deadline
6934755 this is the stupidest plan weve ever not a company on earth that could meet that deadline
6934756 i wouldnt transfer her out of here for a million dollars she knows all there is about inventory management
6934757 im disappointed that we missed the deadline i had two people helping and thought that would be sufficient but evidently it wasnt we need to hire more help

6934765 people love to talk about themselves and they love to talk about their hometown where are you originally from howd you like it there what do you miss most least what was fun to do there
6934766 one colleague asked me about the holiday traditions my family had growing up and which ones weve made a part of our own celebration not only did we share childhood experiences but we reflected on things that matter to us today
6934767 i had a youth pastor that really knew how to engage a group
6934768 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
6934769 i deeply regret any offense my remark in the new york observer might have caused anyone that was not my intent and i expressed that to senator obama
6934770 i have no problem with joe biden i told him it the call wasnt necessary weve got more important things to worry about we have got iraq we have got health care we have got energy this is low on the list
6934771 i didnt take senator bidens comments personally but obviously they were historically inaccurate african american presidential candidates like jesse jackson shirley chisholm carol moseley braun and al sharpton gave a voice to many important issues through their campaigns and no one would call them inarticulate
6934772 i cant help but worry about that 5 month old baby
6934773 annas had such a terrible childhood you have to feel sorry for someone who has been through what she has suffered
6934774 what a romp through life its just fascinating to see how people like that live
6934775 oh you americans your media will drag this story out for weeks
6934776 she had a will that seems so out of character how much of a wild party woman could she really have been if she had a will
6934777 other first spouses have found that a seat at the dinner table is often more powerful than one at the cabinet table
6934778 give these people a hand for opening the door on a new suggestion
6934779 well need to thank teri and carlos for pointing out our blind spot on this issue this could have cost us a lot of time down the road
6934780 no schedules no mandatory meetings the nations leading electronics retailer has embarked on a radical if risky experiment to transform a culture once known for killer hours and herd riding bosses the endeavor called rowe for results only work environment seeks to demolish decades old business dogma that equates physical presence with productivity the goal at best buy is to judge performance on output instead of hours
6934781 hence workers pulling into the companys amenity packed headquarters at 2 p m arent considered late nor are those pulling out at 2 p m seen as leaving early there are no schedules no mandatory meetings no impression management hustles work is no longer a place where you go but something you do its o k to take conference calls while you hunt collaborate from your lakeside cabin or log on after dinner so you can spend the afternoon with your kid
6934782 for years i had been focused on the wrong currency
6934783 i was always looking to see if people were here i should have been looking at what they were getting done
6934784 but what we get back far outweighs anything weve lost
6934785 our team of 200 writes financial reports for our executive management team about various deals that were recommending acquisitions mergers joint ventures and the like
6934786 so we all walked out of that meeting thinking so whats that supposed to mean
6934787 to win the war on terror we must take the fight to the enemy
6934788 our success in this war is measured by the things that did not happen
6934789 i work in a public library and for all of my twenty years of experience still find handling rude abusive patrons a challenge my supervisor tells me not to take it personally but that isnt always easy how do i respond when someone gets upset over a 1 00 fine for a late video or an error on their record i try to make light of it and reply that as long as humans sit in front of a computer there will be errors am i to ignore the abuse
6934790 it is my job to ensure proper process deployment activities take place to support process institutionalization and sustainment business process management is the core deliverable of my role which requires that i identify process competency gaps and fill those gaps
6934791 the current division b headcount exceeds the requirements to support the current revenue level and results in a 15 percent decrease in revenue per direct headcount year over year however most of this headcount is being utilized to cover unplanned vacation and training requirements this increased utilization of excess direct manpower on indirect activities appears to be the primary factor for the declining margin performance against plan we should note that there are other operational issues such as exempt time reporting partially utilized headcount at remote sites accounting issues and bid margin projections which need to be addressed please be advised that unless project revenue increases any incremental labor costs will increase period costs and further reduce margins
6934792 our profit margin on the division b project has dropped by 15 percent this quarter because of increased labor costs several operational issues however cause us to doubt the accuracy of that figure exempt time reporting staffing at remote sites accounting procedures and the accuracy of our original projections
6934793 what kind of campaign do you recommend to accomplish my goals
6934794 i can handle print and radio for a reasonable budget
6934795 what approach do you think the project warrants do you think print and radio is the best way to go
6934796 well i mentioned my goals earlier to keep my companys name in the news to generate training leads
6934797 you asked me if i could do a print and radio campaign for you
6934798 no i asked what kind of approach or campaign you recommended to accomplish my goals youre the pr expert i wanted to know your thoughts
6934799 well i cant make a recommendation until you give me more information
6934800 you started out asking me to give you a price and approach before i know what you want
6934801 no i havent yet mentioned money ive just stated my goals for the campaign i began by asking for your recommendation to accomplish my goals so that i could set a budget
6934802 somethings wrong here so weve priced it a little lower to compensate
6934803 somethings wrong with this house so im determined to dump it
6934804 is something really wrong so youre having to offer a guarantee to get somebody to take it off your hands
6934805 death to the president was shouted from the streets of iran this morning
6934806 my grandmother was lonely and i never wrote her or visited her before she died i am so sorry
6934807 i listen to the answers i ask short questions if you ask a question over two sentences to me youre showing off
6934808 im having a celebration and i want you to speak if you think you can
6934809 where are you who are you with when will you be home if you change locations call me back and tell me where you are
6934810 honey just go stand by the car mcdonalds is right down the street
6934811 oh well if thats the worst that ever happens to me thats no big deal
6934812 dianna i dont understand why me but god knows why he put me here and what he wants me to get done before i die so i guess hell leave me here long enough to get it done and thats that
6934813 im a wimp when it comes to pain but im not afraid to die i know where im going
6934814 no im going to have a celebration and i want you to speak if you can
6934815 ive come that you might have life and have it more abundantly
6934816 good im hoping they make a decision before i leave for vacation next week
6934817 were aware of the complaint and we believe the complaint is without merit and intend to defend against it vigorously
6934818 long term thinking is both a requirement and an outcome of true ownership
6934819 john ducks into his cubicle as if it were a foxhole he needs to stick his head out occasionally and help the rest of us fight the war otherwise the parent company is going to take over the entire department
6934820 our poor customer service has become a cancer eating away at our business i see customers walk in here and wait ten minutes before being greeted then once we do help them locate what they need in the store they have to wait again at check out then they wait again at the loading dock the longer a customer stays in our store its like our cancer metastasizes rather than goes into remission
6934821 most of us would agree life has many dimensions or tracks all important to our overall well being mental physical spiritual but some of us are spending all our time on one track and ignoring the rest thinking were going to find satisfaction and fulfillment along the way its not going to happen thats like entering a triathlon and practicing only bicycling for the three months prior to the race
6934822 i spent about a half hour crying moving from room to room in my house
6934823 in fact its almost 100 percent more this year than it was the previous two years
6934824 theres no question theres a variety of suggestions that people are in fact returning
6934825 remittances which is the money immigrants send home to mexico have gone down dramatically over the past year again probably part the economy but also part enforcement leading to fewer people being here
6934826 you know education if you make the most of it you study hard you do your homework and you make an effort to be smart you can do well if you dont you get stuck in iraq
6934827 compared to five years ago do you think verbal written and interpersonal skills have become more or less important for accounting and finance professionals
6934828 i think its always great for kansas to be mentioned in a very positive way
6934829 this certainly has been a very positive light for kansas i think thats always good news
6934830 obama will see a significant bump and believe it is reasonable to expect nearly a 15 point bounce out of a convention in this political environment
6934831 presidential races are close and we expect this one to be no different but they should figure out how to spin the fact that john mccain owns a dozen houses and thinks the fundamentals of our economy are strong before trying to spin our convention
6934832 now that im on a better internet connection and have found a
6934833 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies they cant charge into other countries of course it helps
6934834 we are in iraq now at the invitation of the government
6934835 we went into iraq originally not at the invitation of saddam husseins government
6934836 but i think with british ingenuity wit and resourcefulness we are going to produce a games an opening ceremony a closing ceremony and all the stuff in between that is going to be in our own sweet way just as fantastic
6934837 i am absolutely determined to make sure that we come in under the 9 3bn i have no reason to think that we will have any difficulty in doing that
6934838 i will ensure that london taxpayers and indeed british taxpayers do not pay a penny more
6934839 we are going to have a wonderful games and i can assure you all my team is working very hard to make sure that we protect value for london taxpayers and that people coming to london will enjoy themselves
6934840 we do need to be firm on this we cant allow the olympic delivery authority or whoever else involved with the games simply to try and hold taxpayers to ransom
6934841 the games are for the athletes the games are not for london the games are not for great britain
6934842 pap daar staan 2 ezels een grote en een kleine wie is nu de vader en wie is de moeder
6934843 als je poeh zegt stopt ie en als je poehpoeh zegt gaat ie lopen
6934844 its a confidential deal and the buyer wants anonymity but i can tell you it is not mr trump and its not john mccain

6934853 i thought theyve been the most difficult team for us to defend their offense is so well conceived for their personnel
6934854 south korea showed in the first quarter what they are capable of and i thought we responded in the second and third quarter defensively in particular i thought we did a great job

6934872 the birth of a new baby is the most enriching thing that can happen in an elephant herd

6934878 nor is insight from universals alone but one must also perceive things according to their particulars
6934879 it is necessary for the rhapsode to be an interpreter of the thought of a poet for the sake of his audience and to do this well without having known what the poet says is impossible
6934880 but we still have the same seating chart we had before lunch
6934881 it would be helpful if those who deplore the looting in cyprus would also indicate its consequences to the privileged few who can afford to have their collections published there is as always a lot of hypocrisy around
6934882 theres not much communication between the two the campaign wants to see the text but its been slow in coming they dont want headlines about a clinton snub to obama
6934883 you could argue that nobody is qualified to be president
6934884 bill clinton does not think barack obama will be a great president and he doesnt want to say so but hes a pro hell give an endorsement he also likes doing things last minute and he likes to just go out there and say whats on his mind
6934885 he will bash bush and remind people that they were better off when democrats last ran the white house

6934912 the united states has not kept its promise to remove us from the list of states sponsoring terrorism up until today past the deadline which is crucial to the complete implementation of the agreement
6934913 this is a clear violation of the action for action principle which is the basis for the realization of denuclearization
6934914 if you want me to estimate how much time id say a couple of weeks before you see a major pullout
6934915 if they ask you to get a russian visa if you want to travel from washington to baltimore thats what it looks like

6934923 good morning we want to apply for a marriage license
6934924 why not arent you giving marriage licenses to same gender couples
6934925 yes thousands but we havent had any siblings thats incest
6934926 not gay then why do you want to get married
6934927 for the financial benefits of course and we do love each other besides we dont have any other prospects
6934928 but were issuing marriage licenses to gay and lesbian couples whove been denied equal protection under the law if you are not gay you can get married to a woman
6934929 wait a minute a gay man has the same right to marry a woman as i have but just because im straight doesnt mean i want to marry a woman i want to marry jim
6934930 and i want to marry tim are you going to discriminate against us just because we are not gay
6934931 all right all right ill give you your license next
6934932 thats right you see were all bisexual i love jane and robert jane loves me and june june loves robert and jane and robert loves june and me all of us getting married together is the only way that we can express our sexual preferences in a marital relationship
6934933 but weve only been granting licenses to gay and lesbian couples
6934934 no its just that well the traditional idea of marriage is that its just for couples
6934935 well i mean you have to draw the line somewhere
6934936 who says theres no logical reason to limit marriage to couples the more the better besides we demand our rights the mayor says the constitution guarantees equal protection under the law give us a marriage license
6934937 well my psychiatrist says i have a dual personality so i want to marry the two together maybe i can file a joint income tax return
6934938 that does it i quit you people are making a mockery of marriage
6934939 my six year old nephew was saved but we dont know what happened to his sister
6934940 roberto is in hospital they say he is injured but not seriously he has been sedated and is unconscious he is alive at least we dont know anything of his sister
6934941 i grabbed the arm of my partner jos and looked at gema my sister in law then the plane came to a sharp stop i heard a horrible noise i was thrown forward
6934942 i reached for jos put out my hand to touch him i saw what looked like a doll which fell on the ground i realised this person was dead i knew it wasnt jos
6934943 setting the record straight american history in black amp white
6934944 although it is relatively unreported today historical documents are unequivocal that the klan was established by democrats and that the klan played a prominent role in the democratic party in fact a 13 volume set of congressional investigations from 1872 conclusively and irrefutably documents that fact
6934945 contributing to the evidences was the 1871 appearance before congress of leading south carolina democrat e
6934946 the klan terrorized black americans through murders and public floggings relief was granted only if individuals promised not to vote for republican tickets and violation of this oath was punishable by death since the klan targeted republicans in general it did not limit its violence simply to black republicans white republicans were also included
6934947 the u s and japan will not tell asia and africa to choose poverty disease hunger and illiteracy over electricity
6934948 they dropped me off at my aunts house in pittsburgh
6934949 i grew up a kid of the civil rights movements and i could have said i went to the march on washington but i didnt they dropped me off in pittsburgh pittsburgh
6934950 there will be a large screen on the side of the convention center and watch parties
6934951 the goal is to bring as many people into the process as possible
6934952 the five of us will be bunked together family style
6934953 when people say where were you on aug 28 we want to be able to say we were in the noise
6934954 the day martin luther king spoke in washington i was a young man in the navy watching the speech on television with my grandparents
6934955 i said if i ever get an opportunity to experience history like this in my life i will take it and now im 70 and i never imagined something like this happening in my lifetime
6934956 i hear people say hey can you hook a brother up
6934957 i tell them ill do what i can but please dont ask for floor passes
6934958 a pat on the back through only a few vertebrae removed from a kick in the pants is miles ahead in results
6934959 if i try to be like him who will be like me
6934960 that steamboat willie is in the public domain is easy thats a foregone conclusion
6934961 law and equity might line up on the side of forfeiture
6934962 disney has enough ammunition on its side to dissuade all but the most well financed competitor or any but the most committed public interest advocates from challenging mickey
6934963 many people are so preoccupied with the notion that their own knowledge exceeds the average knowledge of millions of other people that they overlook the more important fact that their knowledge is not even one tenth of the total knowledge of those millions that is the crucial fallacy behind the repeated failures of central planning and other forms of social engineering which concentrate power in the hands of people with less knowledge and more presumption
6934964 but sometimes you have that little piece that you might need in july or august and i just knew they werent going to get it
6934965 this is a historic day for the state of california
6934966 but it might be premature to say that weve seen the bottom as the markets focus could revert very quickly to demand deterioration
6934967 as prices drop saudi arabia may cut back on its recent increase in production which could halt the most recent price decline
6934968 we are communicating to customers around the country making sure that were answering any questions concerning it
6934969 we are finalizing plans that will walk board officials through the process of identifying the problem loading the affected memory cards and verifying that the votes are counted
6934970 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6934971 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6934972 more than 20 dollars clearly shows that there has been speculation in the market
6934973 if there is a trend or dynamic toward lower oil prices venezuela will consider the possibility of a cut in production this is the position that we will take at the next opec meeting
6934974 the price must be maintained at a level close to 100 dollars because the costs have increased
6934975 standing back from all of this to glance at the big picture would certainly seem to endorse the oil markets sharp month long decline
6934976 oil has lost its bullish mojo and it may take a major event or a great technical stand to go get its groove back
6934977 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6934978 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6934979 we had two of the most bearish factors thrown at oil today and were closing moderately higher
6934980 were seeing supply concerns go back into the price of a
6934981 we reiterate that fundamentals in the oil market suggest a return to a rising oil price environment
6934982 consumers can take some solace in the sell off but there are more supportive factors down the road here
6934983 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6934984 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6934985 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6934986 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6934987 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6934988 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6934989 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6934990 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6934991 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6934992 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6934993 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6934994 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6934995 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6934996 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6934997 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6934998 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6934999 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6935000 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6935001 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6935002 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6935003 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6935004 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6935005 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6935006 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6935007 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6935008 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6935009 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6935010 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6935011 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6935012 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6935013 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6935014 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6935015 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
6935016 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6935017 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6935018 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6935019 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6935020 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6935021 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6935022 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6935023 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6935024 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6935025 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6935026 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6935027 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6935028 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6935029 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6935030 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6935031 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales
6935032 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6935033 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6935034 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6935035 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6935036 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6935037 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6935038 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6935039 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6935040 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6935041 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6935042 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6935043 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6935044 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6935045 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6935046 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6935047 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible

6935050 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6935051 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6935052 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6935053 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6935054 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
6935055 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
6935056 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6935057 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6935058 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6935059 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6935060 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica

6935063 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6935064 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6935065 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

6935070 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6935071 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6935072 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6935073 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6935074 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6935075 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6935076 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6935077 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
6935078 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
6935079 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
6935080 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6935081 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6935082 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6935083 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6935084 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6935085 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6935086 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6935087 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6935088 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6935089 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6935090 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6935091 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6935092 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6935093 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6935094 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
6935095 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
6935096 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6935097 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6935098 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
6935099 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6935100 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
6935101 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
6935102 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
6935103 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6935104 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6935105 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6935106 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6935107 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6935108 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6935109 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6935110 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6935111 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6935112 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6935113 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6935114 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6935115 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6935116 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6935117 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6935118 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior

6935120 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
6935121 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6935122 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6935123 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6935124 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6935125 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6935126 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6935127 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales

6935130 if the judges are not restored we will perhaps be forced to sit in the opposition
6935131 we will not try to bring the government down but of course then we have no choice but to sit in the opposition
6935132 we will definitely try our utmost to ensure that they will not pull out because we have promised to work together to serve the country
6935133 if they want to do something in haste they have all the right to do that we cannot force them to be with us but we are trying to reach a consensus
6935134 this is the iraqi governments view and what the government wants
6935135 well have agreement when we have agreement so all of those stories in the newspapers about what the agreement says probably ought to be disregarded until we have an agreement
6935136 obviously we in canada have understood over the past several years how difficult this mission is
6935137 theres no sense in reading about it because its basically the same story they were just in the wrong place at the wrong time they were attacked theyre blown up i think weve gotten used to it unfortunately
6935138 there were about three or four war veterans and there were a lot of young people
6935139 i dont think were getting accustomed to seeing soldiers die there were 100 people on the bridge i left after a while and every bridge all the way home had a 100 people on it its a sign of how special each one of these people are
6935140 there will be a lot of attention but i dont think it will cause a change in policy
6935141 its as tragic at 99 as it is at 101
6935142 j t osullivan will be our starting quarterback going into the season and im expecting him to succeed
6935143 im very confident j t is at the point where hes our best man for the job right now

6935145 this has been a case of j t performing very well thats why we are where we are j t has very good command of the offense hes played well in all three preseason games and now its time for us to get ready for the regular season
6935146 we want to play our best players that give us the best chance to win
6935147 for our football teams sake its time to get ready for our opening game this decision puts more focus on where it should be now
6935148 the valley of the suns finest example of urban residential living
6935149 as low as 4 one month this spring so the couple who once paid between 200 and 300 a month for electricity before installing solar panels are thrilled with their savings
6935150 i talk to people about what almost seems impossible when i look at the numbers said pambianco
6935151 i could pay less up front and less overall thats magic
6935152 you dont have to be independently wealthy to consider getting solar
6935153 we only get paid for the power we deliver to our customers kreamer said
6935154 definitely appeal to buyers more strapped for cash only something that makes solar drastically cheaper such as much higher government incentives or other policies could derail ppas he said
6935155 human existence seems to be largely a struggle to acquire certainty control we tend to make idols out of anything that even remotely or overtly offers security life insurance health fads retirement jobs government social status power through association money religion of calamity of terrorism of drugs accidents and animals and storms and etc etc etc these are successful to the degree that fear exists in our lives and fear is focused on uncertainty that which we cannot control we are surrounded by uncertainty and each uncertainty becomes a potential base for fear that drives us into the arms of idolatry regardless how wonderfully advertised one of the greatest of all our fears because it inherently is uncertain is the future and everything or anything that might happen there none of us has any control over the future however imagined it is a blank screen made available upon which we paint the most grisly of possibilities
6935156 he has indicated he is going to waive but until a court order is signed by a judge on monday its not official
6935157 the families of the victims and the victims have had it brought to mind and old wounds have freshened with the attention thats been brought to that milestone
6935158 michael decided that he didnt want to cause any more pain particularly at this point
6935159 hes willing to devote another year of his life to try to do everything in his power to be sure that dr brown or any other experts of the state would no longer have reservations about his being able to successfully reintegrate into society without his being a danger to anyone
6935160 there is also renewed technical selling and talk again of demand destruction the dollar is strong again too
6935161 i want somebody who is going to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policy making
6935162 this is his decision and i expect him to make it however he feels is best

6935164 maybe mccain thinks this economy is working for folks like him but how are things going for you
6935165 we need a place where people can have a discussion and get information
6935166 and people need to know that its not coming from an anti mormon place or a gay castro district place its coming from a faithful place
6935167 when i heard and saw the letter that the church leaders had read in sacrament meetings i was appalled
6935168 so i said thats it i want mormons to know that there are gay people in their congregations every sunday
6935169 i really just want people to try and understand and see the pain they are causing gay members of the church who are struggling
6935170 provide license to infringe or impose upon the rights and liberties of others
6935171 if there would have been a site like this it would have been really helpful
6935172 last time during prop 22 all i did was vote no this time i wanted to stand up and be heard even though its hard
6935173 there is a lot of anxiety and stress over being conflicted being an active mormon and being for gay marriage
6935174 thats part of the reason we wanted to do the site
6935175 if you think you are the only person in your ward that feels that way and the rhetoric is really loud its painful
6935176 the church of course recognizes and accepts that some among its very large membership may view the issue differently
6935177 i get to build confidence its fun i can show off my leg it doesnt matter if they see it or not or my fingers it doesnt matter

6935221 drug testing is increasing in just about every level not only in government but also in the private sector
6935222 im going to decline to comment on what the 9th circuit says is appropriate
6935223 but i would say that generally speaking drug testing has been upheld as constitutional and appropriate not only in government but in the private sector and schools as well
6935224 i think that the reasoning is solid and compelling and that the courts if this is done correctly that we would be successful in a challenge

6935292 downtown silver spring is committed to our community and when the students from blair high school approached us for our support of their efforts we felt this was a terrific group of students wanting to do wonderful things to help others in need
6935293 i just sucked it up excuse my expression but thats what i did
6935294 it is a game you have to hide everything and give it everything you cant just stop because you broke something
6935295 im not going to go up there and start screaming and crying like a child
6935296 i still won silver and i hope my country is proud of me part of this is for them
6935297 i was looking at the flag and hopefully the next time it will be in the middle
6935298 when i told him i wanted to go to the olympics he said he was going to be with me all the way and that he was going to support me and make sure i was here one day
6935299 im tested on my own i have to figure things out of my own
6935300 i know that my dad was with people that i love and people who care for him as well they were all there to support each other so i think that comforts me
6935301 you have to just find out what you have to do to make it and i knew what i had to do
6935302 in the end i told myself if i wanted to go to the games i had to do everything in my power to go

6935305 we have a process in place but beyond that any other comment on what it is were reviewing is a little premature right now
6935306 i did what i was supposed to do she did what she was supposed to do
6935307 my whole thing was every time i felt tired i just said go harder hall said
6935308 we have keywords that are supposed to be technical cues
6935309 it was there but it was not there i knew my body was not happy but mentally i knew i had enough to hammer through to the end
6935310 its a bit surreal it was an awesome race for me i went out and raced like i know i can and like my coach told me to it really panned out it was a great one really good
6935311 i learned a lot about myself this season i think this whole year
6935312 i went through a lot of changes obviously for the better i did learn how to race i think i learned how to win and be comfortable being fast and believing in myself and not being afraid to actually go for it i think i owe a lot of that to mike
6935313 we worked really hard at that this year thats what we did when you focus on something like that and it works i think its pretty cool it doesnt always work so its kind of wicked when it does
6935314 sometimes youre sitting there in a hotel like this week sitting there alone
6935315 its kind of stressful and its hard those are the downs when you feel alone then i check my inbox and ive got 200 messages from people back home that ive never met cheering me on
6935316 then you feel like ok wait a minute im not alone and its really nice
6935317 just having to get the olympic entry and working so hard to gain the entry made him change how he raced
6935318 it made him learn to race a little bit better which has made a big difference i think
6935319 i knew if i could stay close to him through the first half that id be in the game
6935320 there are times at night usually youre going to bed and you feel lonely and youre wishing its all over
6935321 im not going to lie this past week ive wanted this to be over ive loved every minute of it but at the same time im like all right this is a long season i feel that my little tired body is tired and wants to stop
6935322 what kind of crap are they going to try to tell him

6935331 obama picks first pregnant vice presidential running mate moms vote en masse for him
6935332 that is similar to blah blah from seed from wing from g from cg as if those series doesnt have similarities to other series jesus christ
6935333 i wasnt allowed to play new music for people after that
6935334 if you know that somebodys passionate enough about a song to want to sing it thats a really good indicator that its going to do well
6935335 ive come to a place in my life where there are songs that want to be written and that i really want to sing
6935336 we didnt think the record would be ready until next year but the music weve been making is so inspiring weve been on a real creative jag
6935337 its one of the things that got me started off on the right foot i got to hear songwriting on that album from guys like cowboy jack clement allen reynolds bob mcdill dickey lee and not to mention waylon jennings theres a roger miller tune on that album theres so many good things about that one album in particular for me that its just an education and its been one of my favorite albums in my whole life every so often ill go back and listen to the whole thing start to finish again i wanna hear that and feel it and every time you learn somethin different
6935338 i said its not the best song on the record but this is the song that could get us in the door and you know thats what we want we went round and round about it and finally i guess for lack of any other reason they put it out and it worked for us i love that song somebody told me the other day you know youre gonna be playin that song for the rest of your life ive been playin let her cry for 22 years and im okay with that so ill be okay with this
6935339 i included born yesterday in the episode of coronation street for 19th march 2004 it was the christening of tracy barlows baby and born yesterday is the reading unfortunately the obligatory soap fracas curtailed its beautiful ending but i scripted it so we heard the lions share i was delighted to be able to plug my favourite larkin poem and it was perfectly suited to the storyline im proud to write for corrie and honoured to honour philip larkin
6935340 go ahead you know you want it you deserve it too
6935341 it isnt worth it and you know it the price youll pay is more than you are willing to give in the long run be sensible
6935342 but you are worth it and youve waited so long for it
6935343 why have i not been a fan of horsing jumping until now
6935344 the supervised injection site undercuts the ethics of medical practice and sets a debilitating example for all physicians and nurses both present and future in canada
6935345 i found the use of medical ethics to justify a political decision which will affect social policy to be troubling at best and misleading at worst
6935346 the repugnant aspect is his attack on the morality and ethics of human beings who are trying to work with a very difficult population
6935347 i mean where does he come off where does he appoint himself as a moral judge of professionals who he doesnt understand and knows nothing about
6935348 the minister ought to resign if he cannot tolerate disagreement without personally attacking health professionals who under challenging circumstances and with no help from his government are attempting to relieve suffering of which he seems to have no understanding
6935349 i almost feel a certain amount of pity for the guy clement because i think he doesnt seem to grasp just how sophisticated the level of discussion has been thats gone on around ethics
6935350 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6935351 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
6935352 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6935353 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6935354 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6935355 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6935356 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6935357 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6935358 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6935359 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6935360 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6935361 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6935362 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6935363 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6935364 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6935365 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6935366 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6935367 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6935368 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6935369 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6935370 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6935371 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6935372 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6935373 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6935374 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6935375 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6935376 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6935377 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6935378 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6935379 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6935380 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6935381 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6935382 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6935383 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6935384 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6935385 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6935386 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6935387 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6935388 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6935389 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6935390 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6935391 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6935392 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6935393 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6935394 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6935395 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6935396 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6935397 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6935398 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6935399 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6935400 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6935401 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6935402 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6935403 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6935404 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6935405 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6935406 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6935407 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6935408 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6935409 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6935410 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6935411 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6935412 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6935413 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6935414 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6935415 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6935416 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6935417 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6935418 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6935419 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6935420 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6935421 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6935422 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6935423 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6935424 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6935425 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6935426 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6935427 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6935428 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6935429 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6935430 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6935431 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6935432 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6935433 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6935434 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6935435 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6935436 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6935437 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6935438 this is a planning took where all things are going

6935440 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6935441 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6935442 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6935443 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6935444 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6935445 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6935446 you should lay hands on the dehydrator and ask jesus to fix it

6935448 i tell you the truth if you have faith and do not doubt not only can you do what was done to the fig tree but also you can say to this mountain go throw yourself into the sea and it will be done 22if you believe you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer
6935449 kami mencadangkan debat ini diadakan pada 24 ogos 2008 jam 2 petang di mana mana kawasan di dalam parlimen permatang pauh
6935450 kami berhasrat debat ini dapat ditonton serta didengari oleh penduduk permatang pauh dan seluruh malaysia oleh itu kami mencadangkan debat ini juga dapat disiarkan secara siaran langsung oleh stesen stesen televisyen seperti rtm tv3 ntv7 tv9 dan astro awani

6935453 budaya politik yang lebih matang dan sihat dapat diketengahkan kepada rakyat
6935454 malah yang jauh lebih utama ialah menumpu kepada bagaimana negara harus mengatasi kemelut sosio ekonomi politik yang terus menjadi cabaran yang semakin rumit dan kompleks
6935455 kami resah melihat semakin berkembangnya budaya di kalangan ahli politik dan organisasi yang mereka wakili untuk mempolemikkan isu picisan serta terlibat di dalam kempen membunuh keperibadian
6935456 kami tidak mempunyai tujuan lain dalam menganjurkan debat ini selain mengharapkan debat ini menjadi medan untuk mengangkat isu isu nasional dan tempatan

6935460 if he wants to run for mayor a third time i think its a great idea
6935461 wed love to have him around but thats a decision he has to make
6935462 there was a time he wanted to run for president that wouldnt have been a bad idea either
6935463 you can make an argument that one is too little two is right three is too much or vice versa
6935464 doesnt want bloomberg running for governor and extending term limits is one way to get rid of him
6935465 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected text help for help std charges apply please forward
6935466 he said im the bartender if youre going to shoot anybody shoot me
6935467 one by one and put a gun in your face and in your back and said give me your money give me your money
6935468 hes very strong on veterans affairs military affairs he represents president bushs hometown so theres certainly an attraction to chet edwards
6935469 the date will resonate with america on how far weve come
6935470 think about it an african american has never been nominated before
6935471 mr obama has achieved what seemed to be impossible for many he brings hope and inspiration for this entire nation
6935472 right now theres a little dissention the clinton supporters are hanging tough they want a floor vote

6935479 on the consoles they want us to charge money for them because thats in their model and our model is very much more to grow the community by giving out free updates
6935480 were always evaluating whats happening in the marketplace and certainly something thats happening in the last couple of months is that sonys managed to sell some boxes
6935481 so whether or not you like developing for that platform if theyve got millions of people connected to that platform and buying their games you have to take it seriously
6935482 its deeply troubling and unfortunate that president bush should fire this parting shot at womens access to basic health care in the waning days of his administration
6935483 time and time again he has put political and ideological concerns above the best interests of the american people and this is yet another example
6935484 we continue to be very concerned about the scope and impact of this proposed rule it leaves open the possibility that institutions and individuals can deny access to birth control and permits individuals to refuse to provide even counseling about basic heath care services

6935610 i n the lawless south hebron hills things are wild as usual the settlers continue to attack shepherd children with clubs and stones to steal their sheep and to make their lives miserable while the israel police continue to abuse anyone who tries to file a complaint against the settlers
6935611 i drive with the tractor to yata to bring water if the soldiers are nice they let me pass if not i have to travel three hours in the fields on a route that bypasses the checkpoint it all depends on the type of soldier at the checkpoint
6935612 we were born in caves and were used to a hard life we have no problem we became used to it already from our parents and i also force my children to become accustomed to our hard life only the settlers disrupt our lives they are destroying our lives we grew up with this we liked this situation we like to be with nature in difficult conditions except for the settlers who have inhabited our lands they have disrupted things all we want is to continue our lives thats all and we hope that the settlers will stop causing us problems theyre interrupting our lives
6935613 when i come to the police station they see me and close the gate i waste my entire day there if i go to file a complaint i need to spend an entire day in the sun thats what happened the last time i stood there tossed outside like a dog i push the buttons speak on the intercom they tell me ill be admitted right away and nothing happens
6935614 i had arrived there at 10 a m and it took me until 5 30 p m before i could file the complaint even when i had already done so i felt that the policemen were not receiving me properly and the investigator was not writing down what i said
6935615 they began to shoot those paint bombs at our children and our children got scared and fled
6935616 i wanted to approach to ask them why are you stealing our sheep but they are very fanatic people and they told me to leave the place immediately i didnt see bilal or the sheep where was bilal where were the sheep i was afraid i phoned the emergency number 100 they didnt answer it started to get dark were in the dark alone theyre cursing and shouting and im worried about my son and the sheep

6935637 our banking is sub sub sub sub prime you cant get any lower than us we have no collateral no insurance no taxpayer guarantees and no lawyers in our system
6935638 yet we have a loan repayment rate of over 98 percent our model has never faltered over the years
6935639 the worlds big banks had all the collateral all the guarantees all the lawyers and what did they do they sent us a 1 trillion bill
6935640 we send our people out on bicycles to check if they are poor enough if a woman lives in a one room house she qualifies if she has a leaky roof she qualifies we even give loans to beggars this is risky
6935641 the banks gave the impression that they were almost perfect and then we find there is a fundamental flaw in the structure of the system
6935642 we dont seem to be accusing anybody over this whole debacle it is as if nobody is responsible we can all go off and play golf the taxpayer will take care of the problem when things go well the bankers take the profit and when it goes wrong they are compensated this is not symmetrical
6935643 the next thing we are going to see is a micro finance bubble the players are becoming bigger and bigger weve now got hedge funds and mutual funds going around saying this is a wonderful idea you can make so much money and help people at the same time its intoxicating

6935650 we sell in the cheapest possible way with no frills hoping that enough of it will reach poor children
6935651 so far 11 000 have stopped begging completely and the other 90 000 are now part time beggars they know when to sell and which houses are a soft touch for begging this is good market segmentation it takes time to close down a core business
6935652 i believe all people are entrepreneurs poverty is not inherent it is artificially imposed by the denial of opportunities
6935653 one day we will create poverty museums we will take the next generation of children to show them what it used to be like and they wont be able to believe it there is no need for anybody to be poor
6935654 we are hearing that the rangers will sign mats and deal gomez

6935711 i think its a fair assessment that ive done more than anybody else in my position

6935714 we his coach alex parnov and hooker really saw london as the competition i was setting myself for in europe i knew that would be the only place where i would be jumping against yevgeniy and brad walker of the usa the beijing favourite eliminated in qualifying so i was sort of treating it like a mock olympic final
6935715 i have only done four meetings in europe so i still feel really fresh and eager to go

6935738 we wanted to bring a deserving rider up from the amateur ranks through our relationship with waste management
6935739 were happy to give kiel this opportunity and i hope that he becomes a successful long term addition to the team
6935740 placing someone in the pro peloton proves their form is sound and im thankful for our relationship with jelly belly
6935741 we hope to do even better in 2009 for both the sponsors and the riders
6935742 maybe it is too scary today when it is wet better to wait for the race tomorrow
6935743 todays finish was much better with a two kilometer flat stretch at the very end and we did a lot better as well jj even started a bit too soon and used a lot of energy getting to the front aided by matthew goss after the other riders had opened the sprint early but well done for sure
6935744 i dont know why the city of golden would want al jazeera to come and broadcast from here what the network takes home with it would be totally different from what they see
6935745 after listening to public comment the city manager has learned that this decision has been quite divisive so he declined having al jazeera at his house doing interviews during the dnc next week

6935752 i was not expecting anything like this i thought it was going to be a few girls from the gym and coaches
6935753 2012 isnt out of the question right now but im taking it one day at a time
6935754 when you think about the six seven cars that are still battling that out eight cars maybe those eight cars are in a position where finishing 12th is way better than finishing 38th
6935755 you dont want to go out there and risk running out of fuel or anything but theres not a lot you can do here
6935756 a lot of the wrecks that you end up finding yourselves in here are because of something that happened two or three cars ahead of you
6935757 a school with good athletics can only exist when you have good nurturing coaches along with determined talented athletes westlake has both of these
6935758 students expect great things to come from our athletic department
6935759 the discipline it takes to be an athlete is the same discipline it takes to do well academically
6935760 there is a strong correlation between preparing for a game and habits you have to reach academic success
6935761 they prioritize their activities and train as much as they can
6935762 athletics is important to westlake and it shows when we take the court field gym or pool
6935763 its no secret that we practice winning it sounds simple but i dont think all teams practice actually winning they practice forehands backhands serving all of that is good but you have to practice winning too
6935764 they were winners and i wanted to be just like them
6935765 i wanted to play on a team like that i never really dreamed about being a star i just wanted to play on a winning westlake team
6935766 its all about the mentality and tradition of the players coaches and the teams
6935767 its a hard nosed attitude to win we work together to reach the same goal
6935768 i dont know if that will continue but hopefully it wont
6935769 was i disappointed nah they told me it wasnt because i was doing something wrong it was just about splitting a little time
6935770 i love stepping up and making plays when i get a chance
6935771 brandon and i we both want to be the best at what we do
6935772 he has played well at times he has played like the rest of our defense has at other times missing that game last week of course threw him back a little bit
6935773 payne has made a lot of progress he brings a certain attitude to the defense i like what he has been able to do even though hes a young player who needs more experience in time hell be a pretty good safety
6935774 people are confused and lethargic not simply because they are tired of hearing the gospel or because they have never really been emotionally gripped by it but also because they are confused they have not heard the gospel in a way that provokes a thoughtful basement to attic reappraisal of themselves and their world
6935775 johnny gets up takes off his leather jacket taped to his chest theres the answer you got pen knives and jack knives and switchblades preferred switchblades preferred then he cries then he screams saying life is full of pain im cruisin through my brain

6935777 while you stop short of naming the individuals you targeted in your book your detailed descriptions of their unique characteristics and mannerisms make them easily identifiable in our small community
6935778 you cant read im going to catch you in a lie berry
6935779 when i am in desperation i dont make good choices
6935780 this could be a 40th birthday present to yourself to say im financially sound
6935781 we are going to continue our enforcement of immigration law whether it is convenient for people or whether its not convenient
6935782 it seems to me ice used this as nothing more than a publicity ploy as a means to justify their harsh enforcement of immigration law
6935783 congress has mandated that we enforce these laws and that is what we intend to do
6935784 is this something that would make you happy to do all day every day if you made no money doing it
6935785 yes i just really want to do it and money or no money it is something that i want to do
6935786 right now weve got two energy policies in this country
6935787 one is war the other is drilling and neither one of them works
6935788 were going to leave some of our oil in our soil
6935789 continuaremos haciendo que se cumpla la ley migratoria le convenga o no a la gente
6935790 el congreso ha dictado que reforcemos esas leyes y eso es lo que intentamos hacer
6935791 me parece que el ice utiliz esto nada m s como una estrategia publicitaria para justificar sus medidas brutales para hacer que se cumpla la ley de inmigraci n
6935792 ah yes that would the grand caracas mine in venezuela
6935793 nothing ever begins there is no first moment no single word or place from which this or any other story springs
6935794 performance appraisals are not worth the paper they were written on
6935795 the system is flawed the system doesnt work well and in my opinion the system causes more problems
6935796 i have only a finite number of words in me
6935797 i cant remember the last time i used a notebook
6935798 i dont think i should festoon myself with buttons and signs and spend a week in denver
6935799 i dont know who is going to the convention from my caucus what i do know is that our no 1 priority is to solve the budget
6935800 i cant justify going when we dont have a budget
6935801 given the fact that the legislature is over two months past their constitutional deadline and our state faces a looming cash crisis most californians will probably be disappointed to hear that the assembly has chosen not to hold session for most of next week
6935802 i cant imagine anyone going so if anybody goes there and theyre not here then i think all hell will rain down upon them
6935803 we ought to be here and the public ought to be outraged if were anywhere but here
6935804 if we dont have official work that were supposed to be here doing here part of our job as democrats is to help elect our next president
6935805 i was gung ho about going to the convention but im going to take it one day at a time
6935806 ive got to think about what i should do how it might look for me to be partying at the democratic convention when were without a budget

6935820 we had reached an agreement with everton for the loan of tiago
6935821 all that was needed was the players agreement and that never came we take it therefore that tiago will stay with us
6935822 i watched the first half and then stopped watching because i felt the game was over
6935823 chelsea were very good but portsmouth had a bad day at the office that can happen to anybody before they could even get into the game it was already over for them
6935824 however chelsea were impressive but on one game you cannot assess too much chelsea will be one of the super candidates to fight for the title but i feel we have enough to fight with them
6935825 tottenham fans are no exception to any others they support the team and get behind the side
6935826 if a player is on form if he knocks in a couple of goals then im sure anyone who booed him last week will soon be getting behind him and cheering him that is what it is like

6935830 i said what could they possibly do they cant arrest me for this i was wrong
6935831 dont want to discuss it more but would like to answer one anonymos in your blog who said
6935832 they not only armed this idioten and teached him to kill our people but also blame us when we protect oneself thank goodness with such friend we dont need any enemies
6935833 its blm land that land belongs to me it belongs to us
6935834 gives kids appreciation for their families and roots arms them with a real understanding of helping their neighbors working hard and getting through lifes difficulties and yet we are restricting activity there
6935835 i find it so ironic that the blm can administer lands in moab where four wheelers bikes and jeeps can tear the living daylights out of the landscape and it doesnt cost visitors a dime
6935836 on a dirt track in the middle of nowhere is good for youth and should be encouraged
6935837 i think the blm has been very fair theyve allowed us to use the trail and im grateful for that
6935838 take a leadership role in the nation in dealing with the legacy of the genocide of indigenous peoples in the americas
6935839 to begin to examine the american and european history of white supremacy and here how that doctrine shaped the formation of minnesota and its public and private institutions
6935840 the results could be transforming for us and for all the world
6935841 we call upon the people of conscience in the roman catholic hierarchy to persuade pope john ii to formally revoke the inter caetera bull of may 4 1493 which will restore our fundamental human rights that papal document called for our nations and peoples to be subjugated so the christian empire and its doctrines would be propagated the u s supreme court ruling johnson v mcintosh 8 wheat 543 in 1823 adopted the same principle of subjugation expressed in the inter caetera bull this papal bull has been and continues to be devastating to our religions our cultures and the survival of our populations
6935842 for the dakota people it fort snelling represents the coercive power that forced them from their ancestral homeland as well as the actual location of a concentration camp where many died in the harsh winter of 1862 63
6935843 the state appropriate funds for the removal and reconstruction of fort snelling on more neutral ground and to turn the reconstructed site into the minnesota museum of genocide the original site would be turned into a state park in which the dnr and the dakota communities of minnesota both federally recognized and non federally recognized would come to an agreement on the design and management
6935844 we still remain either unaware of or unable to look at our own history and acknowledge the painful wounds of ethnocide and genocide right here in minnesota we have a very hard time acknowledging that the pain remains and that it has affected much of our history thru to the present day
6935845 the states of arizona and maine have passed measures of support for the declaration as has the city of phoenix
6935846 the mdewakanton are considered in the oral tradition one of the most ancient divisions of the sioux nation or ocetisakowin seven council fires the sacred lake mille lacs figures prominently in lakota dakota creation stories the lake is considered sacred because the dakota people emerged from it as human beings into this world
6935847 once gov alexander ramsey made his infamous declaration on sept 9 1862 that the sioux indians of minnesota must be exterminated or driven forever beyond the borders of the state his genocidal agenda was widely and wildly supported by white minnesotans his call was very clearly a demand for what we would today identify as ethnic cleansing everything that followed fit into this larger agenda an extraordinarily successful genocidal effort from which dakota people have never recovered
6935848 the hangings the concentration camps and forced imprisonments the forced gender segregation the punitive campaigns into dakota territory to hunt down and terrorize those trying to flee the bounties on dakota scalps all are examples of how ramseys plan was successfully implemented in addition dakota people suffered the consequences of similarly genocidal policies carried out nationally against all indigenous peoples what this means is that genocide in minnesota and the united states was systematic and that it was carried out and supported in different forms by regular people throughout the 19th and 20th centuries
6935849 they could be much more easily converted to our holy faith by gentle means than by force
6935850 with weapons and 50 men i could enslave the entire population
6935851 let us in the name of the holy trinity go on sending all the slaves that can be sold
6935852 for they are still acting like ravening beasts killing terrorizing afflicting torturing and destroying the native peoples doing all this with the strangest and most varied new methods of cruelty never seen or heard of before and to such a degree that this island of hispaniola once so populous having a population that i estimated to be more than three million has now a population of barely two hundred persons
6935853 well known explorer daniel greysolon sieur dulhut collectively referred to the area as izatys a name the mdewakanton dakota people gave themselves sieur du lhuts poor handwriting caused a wrong translation of the word izatys the iz was transcribed as a k and further error caused the name to be kathio a word that translates to nothing kathio became a name so attached to the area that the park bears that name today
6935854 the name of this place should be isanti e sawn tay state park because that is correct whereas kathio is incorrect isan means knife and isanti refers to the knife lake and mille lacs lake people of the dakota nation
6935855 all of the wealth of minnesota was in an important way financed by the taking of lands from the first nations at gunpoint

6935863 theyve got eight starters back on defense theyve got a couple more transfers i think they have 14 transfers from division i schools offensively they have three good running backs they have a very good center and a couple good wideouts the question for them right now is where are they at quarterback
6935864 they went out and had a lot of life in practice today so maybe it was good for them

6935882 volgende maand gaan we naar spanje om een nieuw reclamespotje op te nemen
6935883 het is echt een bevestiging van wat ik tot nu toe heb bereikt
6935884 we hebben gisteren met zn twee n lang gepraat en zijn tot de conclusie gekomen dat we gewoon te weinig tijd hebben om echt wat op te bouwen je kunt geen goede basis voor een relatie leggen als je elkaar zo weinig kunt zien
6935885 volgende maand gaan we naar spanje om een nieuw reclamespotje op te nemen
6935886 as far as i know were not getting paid thats all i know
6935887 not so much from the doctors but from the nurses doom drag confusion not really knowing whats going to happen to them
6935888 we tried our best to remain open to serve patients but unfortunately our financial circumstances wouldnt permit it
6935889 i do know that when you do go to the other emergency it is jam packed and you have a tremendous wait there is a need for this this i know
6935890 i think its just faster and pretty much the same the thing about it is we start closer to the correct setup now when we rolled it off the truck we ran a 15 93 on our second or third lap so the car was right on we tried to make it a little bit better and made it worse made it worse and got back to about the same we didnt make it any better i think were getting close to fine tuning on the car its as good as were gonna make it with the tools we have well continue to make small pieces better but were beyond those big gains right now now were fine tuning on this car
6935891 you really have to be thinking youve got to be sharp youve got to be on your game theres no time to take a breath around this place it is very very fast and thats what makes it fun and exciting
6935892 its a little more physical just because youre turning on the wheel so much youre holding your breath youre down in the corner its as physical as darlington is in the corner but darlington has got a little bit of a straightaway to take a breath on this doesnt this is a little short straightaway and then youre back into the corner again so it is physically a lot more demanding and probably more demanding than anywhere we go really
6935893 no not at all because you can be caught up in a wreck here just as fast as you can shake your head if somebody checks up in front of you youre in an accident its easier to drive from a standpoint of its easier to manage the car but its just as easy to get into accidents and bumping and banging like it was before
6935894 im just trying to take it the best i can im trying not to think about it im trying to think about the good race tracks we have coming up bristol california richmond those are good tracks for us so i try to focus on the positive and not really think about the points
6935895 i think its the best thing that they could have done it gives us a chance to take a breath and get prepared for the chase get ready to go we came right out of michigan and tested milwaukee for two days and now were here the guys are just run ragged im not the drivers yeah weve got a lot of work to do but its the team guys its nice to give them a break and get those chase cars prepared or get prepared for next year and use those last 10 races for testing and getting prepared for the following season and trying new people out on the pit crew i think those things are important whether you make the chase or not i think its a great thing for our sport
6935896 yeah i heard about that and i said well everybody is gonna get the week off at the end of the summer and then next year theyre all gonna be mad because they lost their week off we try to make everybody happy but this is a big business its about tv its about fans and its about ratings i know they want to be racing every weekend but its not a bad idea with how long our schedule is its not that bad of an idea
6935897 i think its changed things dramatically i think its really put a lot of emphasis and a lot more focus on our sport a lot more to talk about getting prepared for that chase and its put some excitement back in the championship i have to admit i was against it when i first heard of it the first time i didnt really care for that format but after almost winning the title the first time i thought it wasnt such a bad idea afterall
6935898 it is my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
6935899 no need to say this letter better get to where he lays his head
6935900 everyone is against me and the world wants to fight me
6935901 this is what we all dreamed about four years getting back to this point
6935902 we havent done anything yet weve got one more game to go

6935905 we know we have very few chances but we have chances
6935906 we are not satisfied with the silver medal we will look forward to the gold
6935907 the game plan was to get in our heads rattle us up out there and i think we did a hell of a job just keeping our composure
6935908 they wanted to play physical and we played physical with them and i think we beat them at their own game
6935909 im pretty sure yall got a chance the chance is 50 50 right now

6935918 they are lending money at such a fast pace that they are unable to find depositors
6935919 project finance for infrastructure such as the dubai metro and salik toll gates are consuming significant amounts of the oil windfall and government finances and theres a time lag before that investment starts yielding substantial revenues
6935920 one of the big issues in the u a e is the lack of financial instruments

6935939 john mccains been living like this for the last 25 and obviously doesnt have a very clear sense of what ordinary americans are going through

6936152 were going out every friday night and play as hard as we can and weve dedicated not just this game but the whole season to atlas fraley
6936153 i know hes looking down smiling and supporting his team still even though hes not here in body hes here in spirit
6936154 i would always wait until he got home we would talk about football practice or whatever thats one of the biggest things right now i can sit and wait but i know he wont be coming
6936155 atlas was the type of guy who brought out the best in everybody if you were going through something you could talk to him you could count on him
6936156 that which is hateful to you do not do to another the rest of the torah is all commentary now go study
6936157 audio panton cogito singularis listen to everything think for yourself
6936158 we think this is a direct slap in the face to obama who is not telegraph savvy
6936159 obama is too out of touch with the american people especially the youngsters who are quite hep to the telegraph
6936160 there is going to be quite a surge of excited americans at the telegraph offices when i make my historic announcement it sure beats telling everyone who their next vice president will be by sending the announcement by pony express or driving around town in a maverick or pinto throwing flyers on doorsteps
6936161 speculation is running high that as soon as dick cheney tells mccain who his running mate will be that telegraph keys will be clacking all over the country
6936162 this bold move into new advanced technology should dispel any notion that i am old and behind the times
6936163 as it will bring all the conservatives and reagan democrats to the polls to vote for mccain
6936164 the choice of reagan is also a positive for mccain because he will look young and vigorous compared to reagan and he will look more attentive
6936165 i cant believe what those republicans will dig up to win this election
6936166 there is nothing in the constitution that says you have to be alive to be the vice president
6936167 i guess our founding fathers didnt think future generations would be so unscrupulous and so dumb
6936168 mr warren said he had called each man personally to invite him to his event which will focus on how they make decisions and on some of mr warrens main areas of focus like aids poverty and the environment
6936169 democrats have been are and will continue to be people of faith and this convention will demonstrate that in an unprecedented way
6936170 as convention ceo and a pastor myself i am incredibly proud that so many esteemed leaders from the faith community will be with us to celebrate this historic occasion and honor the diverse faith traditions inside the democratic party
6936171 each night of the convention the official program will begin with an invocation and end with a benediction delivered by a national faith leader or an individual who is active in their local faith community
6936172 national leaders from a range of denominations will host the conventions first ever faith caucus meetings during the week where they will discuss bringing people of faith together to address some of the most pressing issues of our time
6936173 on tuesday august 26 the faith caucus will hold two panel discussions
6936174 faith in 2009 how an obama administration will engage people of faith
6936175 theres plenty of them out there theres plenty of good guys and bad guys
6936176 i dont think they should even call it beach volleyball anymore
6936177 because its really sand volleyball beaches no longer come into play
6936178 mi objetivo personal es ser el mejor jugador del mundo y en el real madrid eso no va a ser posible
6936179 si tuviera que mandar un mensaje a la afici n es gracias gracias por el cari o y el tratamiento que tuvieron conmigo
6936180 im going to have spike marks on my back this afternoon
6936181 i see no reason why the guys who are at 4 and 5 under wont shoot a low score today
6936182 i made some bad decisions and it cost me dearly i think i hit three shots that i wish i could hit again and unfortunately i had two doubles and a bogey
6936183 sure i would have liked to play better but i wasnt trying to make doubles i was trying to make birdies
6936184 i did a self lobotomy there a couple times i think i made some silly choices and so be it i played some good golf in between
6936185 its just nice to be on the right side of the cut
6936186 its just nice to be playing on the weekend itll be nice to be playing somewhere near the end of the draw ive been in this position a couple of times this year and i did okay but not great
6936187 you try not to think about it but you know the number you have to get to
6936188 the pickens plan has a mixture of extremely good and important elements and concepts that simply dont comport with energy reality
6936189 i really hoped we couldve taken him at his word we wont rest until he admits the truth that he bankrolled a big lie
6936190 is still intact but 40m of moneys to promote canadian arts and culture has been transferred to fund 2010 vancouver five ring circus sports events like the 24 5m torch relay
6936191 more than 40 million in savings the federal government will reap from controversial cuts to arts and culture funding will be redirected to the vancouver olympic torch relay and two other programs exacerbating fears that replacement initiatives are not in the cards
6936192 the harper government says the 2010 winter olympics opening ceremony must reflect its agenda as the price of its 20 million commitment to the event an internal government briefing memo dated feb 5 says
6936193 the minister emerson has recently confirmed with vanoc in writing that the department of canadian heritage intends to invest 20 million toward the opening ceremony of the olympic winter games in order to ensure that the event adequately reflects the priorities of the government and helps to achieve its domestic and international branding goals
6936194 the rally is to show to the world that we are against indias occupation of kashmir
6936195 it is preposterous for anyone to say so it deserves to be rejected with contempt
6936196 we are a constitutional democracy and what is against the constitution has to be strongly condemned one must remember in our country there is room for all shades of opinion but indias territorial integrity is not negotiable
6936197 and if no one is listening then it is because they dont want to hear because this is a referendum people dont need anyone to represent them they are representing themselves as somebody who has followed peoples movements and who has been in rallies and at the heart or the edge of things i dont think you can dispute what you see here
6936198 since the 1930s there have been debates and disputes about who has the right to represent the kashmiri people whether it was hari singh or sheikh abdullah or someone else and the debate continues till today whether it is the hurriyat or some other party
6936199 india needs azadi from kashmir as much as kashmir needs azadi from india
6936200 to put it mildly it is utter nonsense to provoke people and make such irresponsible statements will not be tolerated
6936201 this is outrageous this is against national spirit and nationalism she is attacking the integrity of the country this is nothing short of sedition
6936202 dudes if its one world whats the deal with the wall
6936203 this has been an absolutely amazing journey something weve he and his coaches been working hard for the last eight years
6936204 we said all along 2008 was the year it was going to happen im so happy that it did
6936205 to be a part of history in the decathlon the thought of some little kid growing up saying he wants to be a decathlete like bryan clay blows my mind
6936206 the goal at the olympic games is to come out and win
6936207 the scores take care of themselves you have to come out at the olympics ready to compete ready to deal with what mother nature has to offer what competitors from other countries have to offer
6936208 there are a few meets we do that are perfect for a decathlon
6936209 thats the type of meet i would expect to break the record at
6936210 enjoy whats happening hes a young guy enjoying himself its a great olympics just enjoy it the guy is a freak of nature hes putting on a show on the biggest stage
6936211 words cant explain four guys going out there believing in each other we wanted to show the world jamaica is a very special country teamwork having fun you cant ask for anything more
6936212 i come out here to perform and let people enjoy themselves the crowd loves it they look forward to seeing me come out doing it they pay good money to see great performances its my work i enjoy it its just me i wont change ill always be myself its my personality
6936213 this is what we all dreamed about four years getting back to this point
6936214 we havent done anything yet weve got one more game to go
6936215 when we played the usa last time we did a terrible job
6936216 i dont know the odds that well win but i am sure that the same thing wont happen again
6936217 we know we have very few chances but we have chances
6936218 we are not satisfied with the silver medal we will look forward to the gold
6936219 the game plan was to get in our heads rattle us up out there and i think we did a hell of a job just keeping our composure
6936220 they wanted to play physical and we played physical with them and i think we beat them at their own game
6936221 im pretty sure yall got a chance the chance is 50 50 right now
6936222 last year we werent expected to do well everything was new and the kids were learning this year its review and we have it under our belts
6936223 we lost a lot but the way we plug guys in well always be competitive its an anomaly

6936237 informar a nuestra comunidad universitaria acerca del trabajo que se encuentra desarrollando el estado de chile en la implementaci n de los convenios n 138 y n 29 ello porque el trabajo infantil no se deroga por decreto sino que con un esfuerzo continuo de cambio social y es precisamente el reconocimiento de esta realidad la que distingue a los convenios de la oit del resto de los tratados internacionales
6936238 nuestro c digo del trabajo s lo destina 6 art culos a la regulaci n del trabajo infantil y no recoge espec ficamente ning n precepto de la convenci n sobre los derechos del ni o de la onu 1989 promulgada por nuestro pa s en 1990 asimismo una parte del inconsciente colectivo de nuestro pa s tiende a pensar que el trabajo infantil es positivo que es sin nimo de madurez y constituye una fuente de ingresos para su familia ignorando que el trabajo infantil se relaciona directamente con el riesgo social y con la pobreza y que estos flagelos se combaten principalmente con la educaci n de nuestros ni os y no con su trabajo
6936239 hay una relaci n estrecha entre pobreza y trabajo infantil somos el pa s m s desigual de am rica latina y el tercero en el mundo por lo tanto la pobreza y la desigualdad son factores estructurales que est n en la base del trabajo infantil
6936240 la mayor a de las instituciones del estado se plantea el desaf o de que si se est n bajando los niveles de pobreza entonces terminar con el trabajo infantil en chile podr a ser una meta razonable de esta forma ser amos el primer pa s de am rica latina que pueda hablar efectivamente de erradicaci n del trabajo infantil

6936242 the problem is that whereas obama is a young lightweight biden is an old lightweight obama with a hair transplant while obama has only been a lightweight for 47 years biden has been one for 65
6936243 t here wasnt any question about what was happening the abortions were going wrong the babies werent cooperating they wouldnt die as planned or as illinois state senator barack obama so touchingly put it there was movement or some indication that in fact theyre not just coming out limp and dead no senator they wouldnt go along with the program they wouldnt just come out limp and dead they were coming out alive born alive babies vulnerable human beings obama in his detached pomposity might otherwise include among the least of my brothers but of course an abortion extremist cant very well be invoking saint matthew can he so for obama the shunning of these least of our brothers and sisters millions of them is somehow not among americas greatest moral failings
6936244 when it got down to brass tacks barack obama argued that protecting abortion doctors from legal liability was more important than protecting living infants from death
6936245 through obamas radical prism everything is about abortion and not live births but in reality this had nothing to do with burden ing the original decision of the woman and the physician to induce labor and perform an abortion it was about the legal and moral responsibilities of doctors and nurses in circumstances where despite that decision a living human being was delivered

6936250 its deeply troubling amp unfortunate that president bush should fire this parting shot at womens access to basic health care in a waning days of his administration
6936251 time amp time again he has put political amp ideological concerns above a best interests of a american people amp this is yet anoar example
6936252 we continue to be very concerned about a scope amp impact of this proposed rule it leaves open a possibility that institutions amp individuals can deny access to birth control amp permits individuals to refuse to provide even counseling about basic heath care services
6936253 i think the obama camp is going to let the mccain housing news play out
6936254 this is too good for barack it would be foolish to step on their own news theyve been on the defensive for nearly a month and within a week they get two gifts from mccain
6936255 how many houses does he own john mccain says he cant even remember anymore well its seven no wonder mccain just said the fundamentals of our economy are strong
6936256 yesterday we launched a tv ad to show everyone how out of touch john mccain is with the economic realities of regular americans
6936257 but if we are going to get the truth out its going to take all of us working together to make it happen
6936258 this is what we all dreamed about four years getting back to this point
6936259 we havent done anything yet weve got one more game to go

6936269 im not a huge fan of trying to punish your consumer i think there are better solutions than chasing people for money im not sure what they are other than to build game experiences that make it more difficult for there to be any value in pirating games
6936270 we absolutely should crack down on piracy people put a lot of blood sweat and tears into their content and deserve to get paid for it its absolutely wrong it is stealing

6936328 there was a strange event at the mississippi supreme court today im not entirely sure what to make of the story which we have courtesy of patsy brumfeld of the northeast mississippi daily journal this evening heres how her story began something unusual happened thursday at the mississippi supreme court it may be the first time a majority of the justices voted to prohibit a colleague from publishing a dissent in a case in other words presiding justice oliver diaz of ocean springs disagreed with a court decision and wanted to write about it his fellow judges said no he couldnt and they apparently stopped the court clerk from filing diazs statement into the record she goes on to note that chief justice smith and justices waller carlson dickinson and randolph voted to prevent the publication of justice diazs dissent and that her paper was seeking the documents on the case through the state public records act

6936342 we feel like were definitely going to attack more and were definitely going to try to throw the ball more our goal as receivers is to make more plays when opportunities come our way weve got to take advantage of them

6936345 wildlife services is killing more wildlife in the u s than ever including endangered species song birds and other wild animals the public holds dear while paying lip service to civility this gun slinging poison toting agencys first response is to kill
6936346 were asking congress to take away their guns poisons and low flying aircraft by terminating lethal control funding
6936347 in 2007 wildlife services killed a record 90 326 coyotes across the nation but the agency experienced two separate aerial gunning aircraft crashes that resulted two fatalities and two serious injuries it makes sense invest in guard animals and electric fences rather than waste the taxpayer funds to kill the nations wildlife for a handful of individuals
6936348 wildlife services has turned some of the most remote areas in the country into killing fields
6936349 blm promised the public that wildlife would enjoy increased protection from oil and gas drilling during critical winter periods but has routinely broken that promise hopefully blm will provide wildlife more of the protection it needs rather than allowing a mad rush to drill our public lands

6936384 the woman on the train wore an ill fitting dress shirt ironed haphazardly and black pants which looked as if they had spent a few weeks crumpled on the floor of some beige carpeted townhouse bedroom i wondered if she was half blind or if she had simply given up on the niceties of business casual intending to ride on the coattails of her official looking government badge toothpaste stuck to the corner of her mouth it reminded me of my mother
6936385 he is the guest of the iranian government who will control him until such time they have comfortably wrested control of the mahdi army away from him
6936386 my suspicion is considering what these men have been through there is probably not a whole lot in this world they do fear
6936387 sir at this time id like to plead the fifth amendment
6936388 the government is extremely concerned about the fraud that is being put before the jury
6936389 this court is once again calling on his honor and integrity
6936390 my entire career depends on me getting off this list
6936391 i probably wont be able to get a job anywhere else in the world having this mark that im on this list
6936392 it is quite clear when the government does something that takes away not just your job but your occupation your career they have to provide you with some means to clear your name
6936393 i have no idea why i am on the list and theyre not telling officially that im even on the list
6936394 unfortunately it is a problem that is shared by countless individuals who have no connection to terrorism have no connection to crime and dont belong on this list
6936395 the problem with what the government is doing is that they really dont care about innocent casualties
6936396 we served in a war and theyre thumbing their noses at us basically and that makes me feel really sad about this situation
6936397 76 personas entre ellas 19 mujeres siete hombres y el resto ni os de menos de 15 a os
6936398 its true that hackers can and will take advantage of a development and distribution program thats not like windows
6936399 intruders capitalize on the geek factor of linux and there are no licensing restrictions or elaborate security programs backed by big r amp d teams its an anonymous community
6936400 its like the package signing server and stuff red hat seems to be doing the right thing and are going to issue new signing keys etc and will hopefully revoke the old ones
6936401 these works can be seen as metaphors for language i use non traditional art materials such as books and clothes to create work which evokes a sense of dreamy melancholy or magical enchantment
6936402 the result missouri has the highest unemployment in a decade
6936403 congressman hulshof has been part of the problem in washington voting for tax loopholes and unfair trade deals that have shipped missouri jobs overseas
6936404 outsourcing missouri jobs may create good business climates in beijing or new delhi or jakarta but it sure doesnt help our economy here in missouri when missouri jobs get shipped overseas it hurts missouri families it hurts missouri businesses it hurts everyone
6936405 the dollar got pounded yesterday and everbody rushed to buy commodities as a safe haven now the dollar is strengthening so everybodys dumping commodities again
6936406 its still speculative whether russia will use oil as a weapon to punish the west
6936407 but it has certainly focused the market on that geopolitical threat
6936408 he punches me first and his friend who had nothing to do with it punches me
6936409 one of the stupidest things i ever did in my life
6936410 but if thats what the people want im not going to waste a bunch of time and fight it
6936411 he said are you working do you need a ride and she was like no and he pulled out the gun and shot her in the chest
6936412 as long as i committed a crime in their presence their trust went up
6936413 my name shouldnt be there i didnt go to any meetings after i left
6936414 i was there a couple of months and i resigned it just wasnt my bag
6936415 my name shouldnt be there i didnt go to any meetings after i left
6936416 i was there a couple of months and i resigned it just wasnt my bag
6936417 twenty five hundred hits thats more than i ever imagined i would have had to play until i was 80
6936418 i think hell finish with a lot more than 3 000 hes still got a lot of hits in him
6936419 but theres not much time we might have to be a bit creative in building up chamberlains strength
6936420 i want to know if he can throw a cutter
6936421 im not where i want to be but im where i need to be
6936422 twenty five hundred hits thats more than i ever imagined i would have had to play until i was 80
6936423 i think hell finish with a lot more than 3 000 hes still got a lot of hits in him
6936424 but theres not much time we might have to be a bit creative in building up chamberlains strength
6936425 i want to know if he can throw a cutter
6936426 im not where i want to be but im where i need to be
6936427 i think they realize that there is the potential to do real well
6936428 they can do well and they know it i think that will motivate them
6936429 shes a quality setter as well as a quality hitter
6936430 before the season you set your expectations pretty high with a team like this
6936431 and i think because of our experience and the level of talent we ought to expect a lot of ourselves
6936432 i think they realize that there is the potential to do real well
6936433 they can do well and they know it i think that will motivate them
6936434 shes a quality setter as well as a quality hitter
6936435 before the season you set your expectations pretty high with a team like this
6936436 and i think because of our experience and the level of talent we ought to expect a lot of ourselves
6936437 the road gets a little steeper during the second half of the foundations existence
6936438 but were optimistic and on course it will be a great innovation if we accomplish nothing more than giving parents and child care providers a common evaluation system that will drive more early learning and good outcomes low income and immigrant families have oversubscribed on the pilot programs in the targeted areas i believe well raise the rest of the money and deliver on our promises
6936439 in 1972 there were three times as many minnesota kids in kindergarten through 12th grade as there were retirees
6936440 i hope this can be a model well be able to tell the policymakers that we think these are the ways to increase parent involvement and how to get more kids ready for school we think that 80 to 90 percent of kids can be ready for kindergarten
6936441 im pretty confident that melf is going to contribute greatly
6936442 and they lend a rational voice to the discussion melf brings together some agencies and groups that havent worked together previously
6936443 just idling at the curb people talked and there were work groups but it needed some capitalization and to be positioned as an information source for consumers it has a different tweak under melf tutelage
6936444 dazu kann m ntefering einen beitrag leisten er ist aufgrund seiner politischen lebensleistung ein anerkannter und glaubw rdiger politiker
6936445 der auftritt von m ntefering in bayern ist ein ganz normaler vorgang wir sind beide langj hrige politische freunde seine wahlkampf unterst tzung ist ein erfreulicher aber eigentlich selbstverst ndlicher akt der freundschaft und der kollegialit t mehr aber auch nicht
6936446 die spd ist f r die b rger eine gesamtmarke davon kann man sich als landesverband nie ganz abkoppeln
6936447 trotz aller begleitmusik aus anderen l ndern glaube ich dass die menschen wissen es geht hier allein um die zukunft bayerns da z hlen nur bayerische themen und auch bayerische pers nlichkeiten ein erfolg wird unserer sein und ein misserfolg ebenso
6936448 es ist m glich dass die csu unter die absolute mehrheit f llt
6936449 deshalb greift sie zu alten angstparolen sie spricht davon dass nur ein csu w hler ein anst ndiger bayer sei und jetzt warnt sie auch noch vor h lle und satan das wird ihr mehr schaden als nutzen die bayern sind aufgekl rte leute die genau wissen was sie an ihrer spd haben
6936450 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6936451 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6936452 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6936453 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6936454 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6936455 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6936456 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6936457 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6936458 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6936459 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6936460 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6936461 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6936462 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6936463 who are open to doing something on the production side
6936464 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6936465 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6936466 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6936467 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6936468 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6936469 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6936470 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6936471 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6936472 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6936473 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6936474 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6936475 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6936476 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6936477 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6936478 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6936479 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6936480 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6936481 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6936482 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6936483 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6936484 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6936485 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6936486 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6936487 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6936488 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6936489 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6936490 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6936491 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6936492 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6936493 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6936494 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6936495 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6936496 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6936497 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6936498 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6936499 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6936500 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6936501 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6936502 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6936503 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6936504 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6936505 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6936506 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6936507 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6936508 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6936509 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6936510 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6936511 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6936512 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6936513 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6936514 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6936515 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6936516 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6936517 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6936518 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6936519 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6936520 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6936521 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6936522 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6936523 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6936524 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6936525 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6936526 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6936527 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6936528 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6936529 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

6936539 i am not sure it is fair on any of our players to discuss futures in public and in the media andrew has got a contract and we will deal with whatever is on the horizon when the time comes

6936555 world leaders are really good at praising suu kyi but theyre not very good at listening to what she is actually saying
6936556 she says there must be concerted pressure at the un tougher targeted sanctions and international action to end the attacks on ethnic minorities we hope gordon brown will be different
6936557 in the light of the chancellors sympathies for the nld when can we expect sanctions banning all eu investment
6936558 the burmese governments brutal campaign against ethnic minorities inside the country has already resulted in gross violations of human rights
6936559 multiplicity of human rights violations such as forced labour rape beating mutilation torture murder denial of rights to food water and shelter and denial of the right to legal address as part of a strategy to terrorise and subjugate it is clear that rather than abating the intensity of the these attacks has only increased
6936560 particularly in the ethnic areas the junta has been building up its troop presence to subjugate resistance movements and secure control of natural resources and border trade
6936561 these troops are using rape as a weapon to terrorise local communities women and girls as young as 12 are being raped in their homes and farms while travelling and when conscripted as forced labour

6936635 usually you get one ball and then its like dang you want to make the most of one ball
6936636 its hard you cant get one ball for a 100 yard catch this game will definitely be a progression and we need to step up
6936637 we feel like were definitely going to attack more and were definitely going to try to throw the ball more our goal as receivers is to make more plays when opportunities come our way weve got to take advantage of them

6936723 it is ironical to note that the high court has also been swayed by the concession accorded by the state to the sentence of the accused being suspended provided the appeal is heard expeditiously whereas the fact of the matter is that not only have the accused benefited by way of their release but there is also no practical progress towards an expeditious disposal of the appeal as well
6936724 the high court has unfortunately compounded the error committed by the trial court by choosing to suspend even the sentence of two years awarded to the owners during the pendency of their appeal

6936780 el cad ver estelar llamado sgr 1900 14 pertenece a una clase de objetos conocidos como magnetares o magnetoestrellas estos objetos son los n cleos de estrellas masivas que explotaron en forma de supernova pero a diferencia de la mayor a de otras estrellas muertas stas poseen un campo magn tico extremadamente fuerte
6936781 el anillo fue encontrado por casualidad estaba revisando datos de archivo de spitzer y as me di cuenta de que sgr 1900 14 estaba rodeada por un anillo que no hab amos visto antes
6936782 el universo es un lugar muy grande y cosas raras pueden suceder
6936783 el cual no se parece a nada que se haya visto antes se form en 1998 cuando la crujiente superficie de hierro de la magnetoestrella se rompi y provoc una enorme erupci n la explosi n fue tan poderosa que incluso ioniz las capas superiores de la atm sfera de la tierra y sobrecarg los instrumentos de varias naves de la nasa
6936784 estaba rodeada de una nube de polvo y la explosi n excav en ella dejando un anillo de polvo en las partes exteriores el anillo tiene forma ovalada con dimensiones de aproximadamente siete por tres a os luz aparenta ser plano o bidimensional pero los datos no descartan la posibilidad de la presencia de un cascar n tridimensional m s complejo
6936785 es como si la magnetoestrella se hubiera convertido en una enorme antorcha ardiente que destruy el polvo a su alrededor creando de ese modo una gran cavidad
6936786 las estrellas cercanas iluminan el anillo de tal forma que spitzer lo puede ver un anillo de fuego que marcar a la magnetoestrella para toda la eternidad
6936787 los anillos y las esferas son comunes en el universo por ejemplo las estrellas masivas j venes usan su viento estelar para crear burbujas en el espacio moldeando a las nubes de polvo hasta convertirlas en figuras esf ricas despu s cuando esas estrellas mueren en forma de explosi n de supernova sus restos son expulsados y forman bellas estructuras esf ricas llamadas remanentes de supernova los anillos tambi n se pueden formar alrededor de estrellas que han explotado y cuyas capas de material en expansi n chocan contra nubes de polvo preexistentes provocando que el polvo brille como en el caso de la remanente de la supernova 1987a
6936788 pero el anillo alrededor de la magnetoestrella sgr 1900 14 se a adi no encaja en ninguna de estas categor as en primer lugar los remanentes de supernova y el anillo alrededor de 1987a emiten rayos x y ondas de radio el anillo alrededor de sgr 1900 14 no lo hace solamente brilla a ciertas longitudes de onda en el infrarrojo que el spitzer puede ver
6936789 al principio los astr nomos pensaron que el anillo alrededor de sgr 1900 14 se trataba de un eco infrarrojo esto ocurre cuando un objeto lanza una onda explosiva la cual calienta el polvo y lo hace brillar con luz infrarroja pero cuando volvieron a observar a sgr 1900 14 posteriormente el anillo no se hab a movido hacia afuera como lo hubiera hecho un eco infrarrojo
6936790 un an lisis m s profundo revel que el anillo es muy probablemente una cavidad esculpida en una nube de polvo un fen meno que debe de ser bastante raro en el universo ya que no se lo hab a observado con anterioridad este descubrimiento podr a ayudar a los cient ficos a entender si la masa de las estrellas influye sobre el hecho de que se conviertan en magnetoestrellas al morir
6936791 sgr 1900 14 est interactuando con su entorno causando un gran impacto sobre la regi n que la vio nacer
6936792 nuestras observaciones y modelos demuestran que este fue un evento bastante inusual que se comprende mejor e t rminos de un objeto en el l mite entre una supernova normal y un estallido de rayos gamma
6936793 cuando una microonda entra a un superc mulo gana un poco de energ a gravitacional y as vibra un poco m s r pido
6936794 luego al salir del superc mulo debe perder la misma cantidad de energ a pero si la energ a oscura causa que el universo se estire a una tasa m s r pida el superc mulo se achata en los 500 millones de a os que le toma a la microonda cruzarlo de esa forma la onda retiene parte de la energ a que gan al entrar al superc mulo
6936795 con este m todo por primera vez podemos ver qu le ocurre a las microondas al pasar por los superc mulos y supervac os
6936796 los trilobites los dinosaurios los tigres de dientes de sable est n extintos y s lo se les conoce por los f siles los paleont logos estiman que por lo menos el 99 9 de todas las especies de organismos que han existido est n ahora extintas
6936797 si riera y luis garc a se van el equipo quedar muy tocado
6936798 hace dos o tres a os cuando empec a subir al podio y ganar carreras con renault era impensable que espa a pudiera tener dos carreras en el mundial que ahora sea una realidad me hace sentir orgulloso porque la afici n por la f1 ha cambiado mucho en este pa s y yo me encuentro en medio de todo
6936799 era un d a dif cil para probar cosas en el coche porque cada vez que entrabas a la pista lo que quer as era ir mejor que la anterior vuelta
6936800 me gust mucho el ltimo sector sobre todo las curvas 19 y 20 que son muy r pidas y la de la entrada a la recta de meta donde tienes que frenar fuerte con fuerzas g laterales muy fuertes que hacen que se mueva el cockpit y eso te produce un sentimiento que no pasa en otros circuitos me gusta
6936801 encontrar la carga de gasolina adecuada para realizar la vuelta perfecta en la q3 es muy complicado porque en este trazado el coche reacciona distinto en funci n de la carga que lleve
6936802 en simulaciones anteriores esta regi n aparec a suave pero ahora tenemos suficientes detalles para ver c mulos de materia oscura
6936803 algunos de esos c mulos son tan densos que emitir n una gran cantidad de rayos gamma si existen aniquilaci n de materia oscura y podr an ser f cilmente detectables por glast
6936804 existen varias part culas candidatas para la materia oscura fr a y nuestras predicciones para glast dependen del tipo de part cula supuesto y de sus propiedades
6936805 para los wimps t picos deber an detectarse entre unas cuantas y varias docenas de se ales claras sobresaliendo del fondo de rayos gamma tras dos a os de observaciones este ser a un gran descubrimiento para glast
6936806 simula la distribuci n de materia oscura desde casi la poca del big bang hasta la actualidad por lo que pr cticamente abarca toda la edad del universo y se centra el resolver el halo alrededor de una galaxia como la v a l ctea
6936807 suponiendo que nuestra explicaci n es correcta esta es la primera vez que hemos visto algo como esto en el cielo
6936808 nunca hemos visto una galaxia a la que pudi semos se alar y decir esa galaxia estaba activa y ya no lo est
6936809 esto ser a un tipo de indicador hacia la posibilidad de que hay m s agujeros negros creciendo de lo que podr amos haber estimado originalmente
6936810 este objeto ha estado en el archivo durante d cadas
6936811 es s per emocionante debido a que pasaremos apenas a 50 kil metros de la superficie y volaremos dentro de la columna del polo sur
6936812 no veremos tales aperturas ni siquiera con nuestras c maras de mayor resoluci n
6936813 pero tal vez s lo tal vez podr amos ver otras pruebas de erupci n ya sea algo geol gicamente inusual o bancos de nieve donde las part culas de hielo de los chorros caen al suelo
6936814 sea lo que sea que veamos definitivamente ser un evento pionero y muy poco usual
6936815 este es un gran avance en t rminos de comprensi n de materiales y es importante debido a que para comprender la evoluci n a largo plazo de los planetas tenemos que saber m s sobre sus propiedades internas
6936816 el hallazgo tambi n es interesante desde el punto de vista de comprender por qu los materiales est en la forma que est n y qu determina su estabilidad y propiedades f sicas y qu micas
6936817 puedes imaginar este l quido como el mercurio s lo que menos reflectante
6936818 las altas temperaturas hacen que los tomos se sacuda por esto la gente piensa que el calor desviar a los electrones como si se colocasen suficientes rocas en un r o para controlar el flujo del agua
6936819 la dispersi n causada por los tomos se pensaba que har a m s dif cil que los electrones fluyesen
6936820 ahora tenemos que buscar de d nde procede esta fuente de energ a
6936821 no mantendremos nunca a un jugador en contra de su voluntad
6936822 la formaci n de una barra puede ser el importante acto final en la evoluci n de una galaxia espiral
6936823 las galaxias se cree que se construyen a s mismos a trav s de fusiones con otras galaxias tras asentarse la nica forma dr stica para que evolucionen las galaxias es a trav s de la acci n de las barras
6936824 se forma mayormente en las galaxias m s peque as de menor masa
6936825 sabemos que la evoluci n en general es m s r pida para las galaxias m s masivas forman sus estrellas antes y m s r pido y entonces se apagan en discos rojos
6936826 las galaxias de masa baja tambi n se sabe que se forman m s lentamente pero ahora vemos qu tambi n forman sus barras m s lentamente
6936827 se cierran cada vez m s estas rbitas alargadas haciendo la barra cada vez m s fuerte finalmente una alta fracci n de las estrellas del disco interior se unen a la barra
6936828 empujan al gas y las estrellas fuera de su circuito normal en rbita alrededor de las regiones centrales tal vez incluso canalizando gas hacia el agujero negro supermasivo central
6936829 sin este alimento los agujeros negros quedar an hambrientos y las regiones centrales de las galaxias carentes de j venes estrellas
6936830 comprender c mo ocurri esto en las galaxias m s lejanas finalmente arrojar luz sobre c mo ocurri aqu en nuestro patio trasero
6936831 seguro que no vamos a repetir el partido de estados unidos
6936832 la confirmaci n de la presencia de perclorato y los datos de apoyo son importantes antes de una revisi n cient fica por pares y su consiguiente anuncio p blico
6936833 esto es sorprendente dado que una anterior medida de tega de los materiales de superficie era consistente pero no concluyente sobre la presencia de perclorato
6936834 estamos intentando seguir un riguroso proceso cient ficos aunque no hemos completado nuestro proceso en estas muestras de terreno tenemos resultados intermedios muy interesantes
6936835 el an lisis inicial de meca sugiere un terreno similar al de la tierra posteriores an lisis han revelado aspectos no tan similares a la tierra en la qu mica del terreno
6936836 cuando se encuentran resultados sorprendente queremos revisarlos y asegurarnos de que nuestros extensos procesos de control de contaminaci n pre lanzamiento cubrieron este potencial
6936837 supe que quer a ser tenista cuando empec a ganar t tulos
6936838 estos a os siempre he tenido una persona frente a m mejor que yo en todo siempre me he fijado en roger para superarme
6936839 rafa ha sido el que me ha estado apretando m s y me ha obligado a mejorar como jugador para poder seguir por delante al final me ha cazado pero obviamente voy a intentar recuperar el n mero uno
6936840 el equipo ha hecho la pretemporada que se esperaba da lo mismo si se haya perdido o bien se haya ganado lo importante es que el grupo se haya rodado ahora toca esperar el debut del s bado y ganar al eivissa para empezar bien la liga
6936841 tengo mucha confianza en el t cnico y la plantilla me gust mucho la imagen en el partido contra el n stic y a partir de aqu creo que todos podemos estar esperenzados en que se haga una buena temporada
6936842 el alcalde es muy optimista yo tambi n pero no se puede decir de buenas a primeras que el sabadell va a ascender creo que tenemos equipo de play off pero despu s es muy complicado ganarlo y subir no se tiene que presionar al equipo hay que ir paso a paso estoy convencido que haremos una buena temporada
6936843 entrega compa erismo que configuren un vestuario ejemplar y as seguro que se lograran los objetivos
6936844 quiero llegar a los 2 500 socios pero esto depende del inicio de liga y que se ganen partidos en casa para empezar el equipo tiene que animar a los socios no al rev s
6936845 we want to make poeple in the said my co panelist on mprs
6936846 el valencia siempre ha sido mi primera opci n durante el verano he estado muy tranquilo a pesar de todo lo que se ha publicado y al final se ha conseguido gracias al esfuerzo de las dos partes
6936847 siempre me he sentido uno m s y lo sigo siendo quiero dar las gracias al club por el esfuerzo que ha hecho la decisi n ha sido muy f cil para m porque me encuentro muy a gusto en el valencia y espero seguir muchos a os gracias a todos por el cari o que he recibido
6936848 agradecido por el cari o que siempre me han mostrado los aficionados
6936849 afrontar el partido de vuelta con ventaja aunque m nima es importante ellos deber n atacar y tendremos posibilidades de contragolpear con peligro
6936850 esa no es la forma como percibimos a un campe n
6936851 la nica persona que probablemente pod a ofenderse era un bur crata belga que hizo algunas cosas buenas en su tiempo al frente del cio pero que habr a hecho bien en morderse la lengua en esta ocasi n y dejar a la juventud disfrutar de su gran d a
6936852 por supuesto que tenga usted la opini n que tenga acerca de la conducta de bolt es dif cil escuchar al jefe de una organizaci n ticamente dudosa como es el cio dando lecciones de buen comportamiento
6936853 una cosa es que el gobierno chino encarcele a los disidentes que falsifique los pasaportes de gimnastas menores de edad y que establezca zonas oficiales de protesta para luego arrestar a cualquiera que solicite usarlas esos son asuntos que asumo con disciplinado silencio o como yo mismo dije con diplomacia silenciosa pero no puedo ignorar la perturbadora espontaneidad de bolt me siento obligado a reprenderlo
6936854 no mantendremos nunca a un jugador en contra de su voluntad
6936855 me encanta pilotar aqu es muy diferente de los circuitos urbanos que conocemos hab a dado una vuelta a pie el jueves y pensaba que ser a interesante y esa impresi n se ha confirmado est lleno de lugares r pidos y con espacio han hecho un buen trabajo
6936856 estoy orgulloso de pilotar de nuevo en espa a es una pista muy bonita pero hay que estar concentrado porque hay varias curvas que se parecen por un momento cre a estar en la curva 12 y estaba en la 17
6936857 lo que tiene que hacer es trabajar en silencio y dejar trabajar
6936858 se pueden dar expectativas pero no dar un n mero concreto
6936859 y me transmiti su incertidumbre sobre s deb a venir a los juegos hace tiempo que yo ya hab a despejado esas dudas a adi que con que se lo dijera una semana antes ya era suficiente eso me decepcion bastante tambi n me pregunt si pensaba viajar a tenerife campeonato de espa a y yo le dije que no entraba en mis planes cog un avi n por la ma ana y regres el mismo d a por la noche
6936860 es un presidente al que se conoce m s que a los dem s aqu est por ejemplo fulgencio s nchez al que nadie conoce y ya han sacado m s medallas en ciclismo que nosotros en atletismo aunque todav a queda alguna opci n pero no dir qui n
6936861 soy un viejo que sabe mucho no habr a aguantado el ritmo del italiano y por eso opt por hacer una carrera controlada lo pas bastante mal porque tengo problemas en la cadera y el reflejo me llega a la espalda por eso llegu a pek n muy justito de forma de hecho ya tengo fecha para la operaci n ser el pr ximo 12 de septiembre en la dexeus
6936862 s m s por viejo que por diablo cuando veo que manolo y paquillo no van bien ya s que las cosas se tuercen si lo hacen bien es como si descorchara el champ n de lo contrario se complican cuando vi a paquillo s ptimo pens que los medallas aqu iban a estar muy complicadas
6936863 no se puede decir de este agua no beber hasta ahora s lo me planteo llegar a los europeos de barcelona 2010 que me hacen mucha ilusi n llevo 15 a os viviendo en catalunya y estoy muy a gusto all tengo un compromiso con todos para estar despu s ya veremos
6936864 pido perd n a los aficionado y anuncio que me retiro he fallado
6936865 el destino quiso que se librase de coger aquel avi n
6936866 destacaba mucho tanto por su aspecto f sico como por su inteligencia en las discotecas cuando sal amos de marcha ten a a todos los chicos rendidos
6936867 s lo me ha faltado encerrarme en el garaje de casa y pedalear con el motor del coche encendido para habituarme tambi n a la contaminaci n
6936868 francamente no confiaba en que fueran justas me imaginaba que tomar an un peque o fallo que comet como excusa para sacarme fuera de la final
6936869 sospechaba de que a pesar de que me lo merec a pod a quedarme fuera
6936870 est n usando ni os y se creen que somos est pidos
6936871 me extra ar a mucho que laporta perdiera esta votaci n ante la asamblea puede estar tranquilo
6936872 a un atleta que hace 9 69 no se le puede decir c mo tiene que reaccionar
6936873 es un momento nico por el que bolt se ha sacrificado y se ha entrenado durante mucho tiempo y adem s ha hecho historia no es algo planeado no se puede prever c mo actuar si haces 9 69 o ganas la final reaccionas sin pensarlo
6936874 para decirle al mundo que ha hecho algo que nadie hizo antes
6936875 tiene que madurar es un joven pero deber a mostrar m s respeto hacia sus rivales eso estar a m s acorde con el esp ritu del ideal ol mpico
6936876 se hace lo que se pueda para que pueda jugar

6936901 almost every establishment out there are crowned with roofs it is a must in every country because it shields us from the suns heat rainy weather snowstorms and many more that is why every toronto roofing contractor assures their clients that the roofing they sell are tough and can withstand tough weather unlike other companies out there siding contractors in toronto give their utmost service at an affordable cost they offer different kinds of sidings and these are composite insulated masonry metal plastic and wood sidings composite sidings are offered in various styles and can impersonate other siding selections costs of composites have a propensity to be lesser than wood or masonry selections but differ broadly as do installation maintenance and repair constraints needless to say the stability and environmental impact of composite sidings depends on the specific materials used in the manufacturing process insulated sidings provide environmental benefits by reducing energy use by up 20 percent and are designed to last more than 50 years according to manufacturers masonry sidings vary from brick stone and stucco and can accommodate a variety of styles from formal to rustic though masonry can be painted or tinted to match many color palettes it is most suited to neutral earth tones masonry sidings have excellent durability which last for as long as 100 years and requires only minimal maintenance metal siding is ideal for homes in coastal areas because of moisture and salt aluminum metal siding reacts with air to form aluminum oxide an extremely hard coating that seals the aluminum surface from further degradation plastic sidings have environmental benefits its production does not require the consumption of certain natural resources that other types of siding would require such as trees aluminum or stone but petroleum is required lastly and widely used since the olden days wood sidings became every household requirement it is very versatile in style and can be used on a wide variety of homes in any color palette desired if you need roof repairs toronto is the place you have to search for in this area roofing equipments are up to date and assure durability they also give discounts and always make certain that every roof problem is discussed thoroughly for their clients convenience in the future the primary job of most roofs is to keep out water the large area of a roof repels a lot of water which must be directed in some suitable way so that it does not cause damage or hassle in cyclone and hurricane prone areas the main engineering consideration is to hold the roof down during severe storms every component of the roof has to withstand the uplift forces of high wind speeds the weather proofing material is always the topmost or outermost layer exposed to the weather because this prevents damage to roofs in toronto they easily cope with these problems because of the roof and gutter repair that their roof contractors provide one thing that people will like about these toronto roofing contractors is their eagerness to help them from the problematic weather so what are you waiting for bring it on weather youre now defeated

6936908 the united states has not kept its promise to remove us from the list of states sponsoring terrorism up until today past the deadline which is crucial to the complete implementation of the agreement
6936909 this is a clear violation of the action for action principle which is the basis for the realization of denuclearization
6936910 i was going to help with the open heart surgery for my article but at the last minute i threw up and ran out of the room
6936911 i was going to sit on the 10th floors ceiling beams with the construction workers so i could bond with them over lunch but my fear of heights was just too great so i just stayed on the second floor crying and shaking in my hard hat
6936912 its not mccains wealth per se because we dont resent the rich we want to be them

6936915 we found that there are a variety of behaviors learning disabilities and emotional problems that are unique to patients with xxyy syndrome that may be better addressed with more targeted therapies
6936916 our research is important because it provides an accurate picture of what patients are experiencing that can help physicians who treat patients with the disorder
6936917 until now physicians have had to search the medical literature to patch together a treatment plan mostly based on information on klinefelter syndrome
6936918 as a result people with xxyy werent being screened for the specific medical problems associated with their disorder they werent receiving therapies or medications for the behavioral and neurodevelopmental issues that are more profound for them and they werent receiving the types of community services that can help them live independent lives our research is an important resource for families and practitioners
6936919 life skills are more of a struggle for these males and they may need different medications a broader array of behavioral therapies and more intensive community support than those with klinefelter syndrome
6936920 we were tired of having our families running around the country looking for answers from people who didnt have them
6936921 the more we talked the more we realized our boys had things in common that were not addressed in the literature
6936922 kyle knows that people dont understand xxyy and therefore dont understand him as a person she said
6936923 the study helps the world know why he is like he is it validates what he knows about himself and what we know about him when he cant follow directions its not because hes stupid
6936924 banner links to the voting section so is not directly leaking but i do understand your concern as we are sponsoring this event we agreed to send some traffic to them for a short while to plug the awards for best boots best brand etc will be removed toward the end of the week

6936931 reactivar o futebol s nior era um desejo antigo mas s agora foram criadas algumas condi es para avan ar com o projecto era importante ter uma plataforma de acolhimento para os jovens sa dos da nossa forma o e a curto prazo esta equipa ter de ser constitu da com uma grande percentagem de jovens sa dos das nossas camadas jovens
6936932 a ideia de criar o sport clube salgueiros 08 teve apenas o objectivo de conseguirmos inscrever a equipa s nior ser sempre uma fase de transi o quando o clube se libertar de todos os problemas que impedem a cria o do futebol profissional o salgueiros 08 acaba fundindo se com o sport com rcio e salgueiros

6936948 its a meaningless exercise just because you have a lot of random comments it doesnt mean youre growing your influence and making more sales
6936949 you dont want comments you want contact information getting people to give you their contact information is the key to long term relationship and product sales

6937003 if that were to happen out of fear of protesters fear of unrest peru would someday remember it as the moment when change came to a halt and hundreds of thousands of people were condemned to poverty exclusion and marginalization
6937004 i know its non negotiable but what would have to happen
6937005 what would it be like to use these two powerful mind body systems together how powerful would it be to use nlp and eft in reforming reframing recreating energy systems to support people in creating the life of their dreams
6937006 i just cant say that word i can spell out each letter as a child would but i cant put it together
6937007 so you know how each part of the word sounds dont you
6937008 and you know how it should sound if it was said right and you can just say it without thinking
6937009 so if you know how it should sound next time you see the word youll just be able to say it without thinking
6937010 is there anything here i don t know is there anything new and exciting here

6937016 sonny youve got it all wrong every one knows that the earth is held on the shoulders of the giant atlas
6937017 i know that it is company policy not to use headhunters but what would have to happen in order for us to begin working on this and be of value to your firm
6937018 people are that great because of how they were raised up
6937019 i know thats not negotiable but what would have to happen for you to let us in anyway
6937020 at some stage there was child trafficking involved prior to them coming into contact with the agency involved in

6937030 1 la primera y m s clara es la que se deduce del movimiento pues es cierto y lo perciben los sentidos que en este mundo hay movimiento y todo lo que se mueve es movido por otro de hecho nada se mueve a no ser que en cuanto potencia est orientado a aquello para lo que se mueve por su parte quien mueve est en acto pues mover no es m s que pasar de la potencia al acto la potencia no puede pasar a acto m s que por quien est en acto ejemplo el fuego en acto caliente hace que la madera en potencia caliente pase a caliente en acto de este modo la mueve y cambia pero no es posible que una cosa sea lo mismo simult neamente en potencia y en acto s lo lo puede ser respecto a algo distinto ejemplo lo que es caliente en acto no puede ser al mismo tiempo caliente en potencia pero s puede ser en potencia fr o igualmente es imposible que algo mueva y sea movido al mismo tiempo o que se mueva a s mismo todo lo que se mueve necesita ser movido por otro pero si lo que es movido por otro se mueve necesita ser movido por otro y ste por otro este proceder no se puede llevar indefinidamente porque no se llegar a al primero que mueve y as no habr a motor alguno pues los motores intermedios no mueven m s que por ser movidos por el primer motor ejemplo un bast n no mueve nada si no es movido por la mano por lo tanto es necesario llegar a aquel primer motor al que nadie mueve en ste todos reconocen a dios 2 la segunda es la que se deduce de la causa eficiente pues nos encontramos que en el mundo sensible hay un orden de causas eficientes sin embargo no encontramos ni es posible que algo sea causa eficiente de s mismo pues ser a anterior a s mismo cosa imposible en las causas eficientes no es posible proceder indefinidamente porque en todas las causas eficientes hay orden la primera es causa de la intermedia y sta sea una o m ltiple lo es de la ltima puesto que si se quita la causa desaparece el efecto si en el orden de las causas eficientes no existiera la primera no se dar a tampoco ni la ltima ni la intermedia si en las causas eficientes llev semos hasta el infinito este proceder no existir a la primera causa eficiente en consecuencia no habr a efecto ltimo ni causa intermedia y esto es absolutamente falso por lo tanto es necesario admitir una causa eficiente primera todos la llaman dios 3 la tercera es la que se deduce a partir de lo posible y de lo necesario y dice encontramos que las cosas pueden existir o no existir pues pueden ser producidas o destruidas y consecuentemente es posible que existan o que no existan es imposible que las cosas sometidas a tal posibilidad existan siempre pues lo que lleva en s mismo la posibilidad de no existir en un tiempo no existi si pues todas las cosas llevan en s mismas la posibilidad de no existir hubo un tiempo en que nada existi pero si esto es verdad tampoco ahora existir a nada puesto que lo que no existe no empieza a existir m s que por algo que ya existe si pues nada exist a es imposible que algo empezara a existir en consecuencia nada existir a y esto es absolutamente falso luego no todos los seres son s lo posibilidad sino que es preciso alg n ser necesario todo ser necesario encuentra su necesidad en otro o no la tiene por otra parte no es posible que en los seres necesarios se busque la causa de su necesidad llevando este proceder indefinidamente como qued probado al tratar las causas eficientes n m 2 por lo tanto es preciso admitir algo que sea absolutamente necesario cuya causa de su necesidad no est en otro sino que l sea causa de la necesidad de los dem s todos le dicen dios
6937031 4 la cuarta se deduce de la jerarqu a de valores que encontramos en las cosas
6937032 at the heart of the wellington political process for close to 30 years
6937033 we are immensely pleased to be recognized by u s news and world report for educating students without leaving them with insurmountable debt
6937034 at virginia intermont we are committed to providing an outstanding educational experience for our students and having a positive influence on their sense of values and success in life and career
6937035 this highlights the benefit of attending an institution in which the environment for learning is enhanced through small classes and individual attention
6937036 emory amp henry has improved on many scales considered for this ranking
6937037 were hopeful that when the number is reported we will find ourselves improving in this ranking
6937038 we encourage students to look carefully at indicators of academic quality as well as finding a good fit with an institutions mission and campus community
6937039 the statistics are telling but a colleges special qualities are far more than what are represented in numbers and percentages
6937040 besides his wealth and success buffett is also well known for his philanthropic work he has taught his shareholders to not just focus on making wealth but also on distributing it back to the world to help the needy
6937041 the white house had concocted a fake letter from the director of the iraqi intelligence service to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
6937042 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link

6937048 barneys is a mecca for the fashion forward and its highly visible location on the strip signals ultra luxury
6937049 it serves as the ultimate calling card for the shoppes at the palazzo

6937051 the pullback of russian troops and units passed without incident and was completed on time
6937052 russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
6937053 if needed we reserve the right to boost these forces
6937054 i do not believe that these actions can seriously contribute to the stabilisation of the situation in the region

6937056 many neuroscientists are shocked to learn that cells in the brain have cilia thus it was even more exciting to show that cilia have a key function in regulating the birth of new neurons in the brain
6937057 considering sonic hedgehog is also heavily implicated in brain tumor formation our study places the primary cilium at the crossroads of both regenerative neurobiology and neuro oncology
6937058 the increasing availability of single serve and multi packs may not serve consumers in the long run but because they are considered to be innocent pleasures may turn out to be sneaky small sins
6937059 maybe the answer lies in consumers taking responsibility for their consumption and monitoring internal cues of sufficiency rather than letting package size take control
6937060 we are still young and trying to gain experience in the second half i thought we made things more difficult than they needed to be still the bottom line is that these girls fought tonight they did what they needed to do and got the goal they needed to win

6937062 operations research offers a powerful set of tools that have been used successfully in everything from world war ii to wal mart style logistics planning these tools ought to be used to increase the success of existing programs and to help expand access to hiv care and treatment in resource limited countries
6937063 for example operations research could help with the planning of a national drug distribution system or with predicting the demand for services at local clinics and the best ways to staff them
6937064 to date hiv treatment scale up has appropriately focused first on policy level issues such as program initiation and costs and secondarily on operational level issues
6937065 now that many programs are in place the potential gains from improved planning are great especially given the high cost of antiretroviral drug therapy
6937066 the analysis suggested that implementation of such a program could allow the government of rwanda to scale up hiv treatment without overburdening its existing health care system
6937067 the unique advantage of operations research is that it gives us the ability to evaluate and optimize outcomes of various scenarios such as determining the best approach for the management of lab equipment repair without impacting patients
6937068 once we have the evidence for a new approach a good case can be made that it should be implemented as policy although any initiative should take into account the environments in which the projects are to be carried out with all necessary ethical cultural and political considerations
6937069 placing greater emphasis on long term strategic planning and increasing the attention and resources directed to capacity building for sustainability
6937070 while laudable progress has been made the great majority of hiv patients are still under treated or untreated
6937071 we feel that operations research provides one of the tools to make sure progress continues
6937072 this area of research and specifically this and other projects led by drs hupert and xiong shows how fields such as the engineering sciences can contribute to solving medical and public health problems
6937073 the sheer amount of diversity the students discovered surprised everybody strobel said
6937074 we have only just begun to tap the potential of these microorganisms our undergraduates have given us a peek at the treasure these habitats hold and we need to move quickly to preserve them
6937075 clearly the inner tissues of plants are a biological niche for microbial life that warrants further exploration
6937076 it is a niche that can be readily explored by undergraduate students the potential to explore something so completely unknown gets the students very excited about science
6937077 the mindset of this new generation of college students is quite different from that of the faculty about to prepare them to become the leaders of tomorrow
6937078 the warsaw pact is as hazy for them as the league of nations was for their parents
6937079 lenins name has never been on a major city in russia
6937080 we found that there are a variety of behaviors learning disabilities and emotional problems that are unique to patients with xxyy syndrome that may be better addressed with more targeted therapies
6937081 our research is important because it provides an accurate picture of what patients are experiencing that can help physicians who treat patients with the disorder
6937082 until now physicians have had to search the medical literature to patch together a treatment plan mostly based on information on klinefelter syndrome
6937083 as a result people with xxyy werent being screened for the specific medical problems associated with their disorder they werent receiving therapies or medications for the behavioral and neurodevelopmental issues that are more profound for them and they werent receiving the types of community services that can help them live independent lives our research is an important resource for families and practitioners
6937084 life skills are more of a struggle for these males and they may need different medications a broader array of behavioral therapies and more intensive community support than those with klinefelter syndrome
6937085 we were tired of having our families running around the country looking for answers from people who didnt have them
6937086 the more we talked the more we realized our boys had things in common that were not addressed in the literature
6937087 kyle knows that people dont understand xxyy and therefore dont understand him as a person she said
6937088 the study helps the world know why he is like he is it validates what he knows about himself and what we know about him when he cant follow directions its not because hes stupid
6937089 so far what we witness is delay we have first signs of withdrawal at this point but lets see how this thing goes and what matters is very much is that there should not be sense of satisfaction because of this withdrawal because its not a deal
6937090 russia troops are not only in south ossetia and tskinvali and abkhazia but russian troops are in gori nearby villages western part of georgia this proves that measures russia said were an attempt to create peace in south ossetia has nothing to do with truth otherwise they have nothing to do in gori poti

6937097 the withdrawal of russian forces has gone without incident and was concluded according to plan at 19 50 moscow time
6937098 the troop pull back has been started at a rate to make sure that the russian troops be within the zone of responsibility of the russian peacekeeping contingent by the end of august 22

6937103 we will propose between september and october options for a comprehensive solution to the contested areas including the city of kirkuk which represent the most serious problem now in iraq noting that these options will include 12 area
6937104 that one possibility was raised that instead of relying on a referendum to decide the future of the city all parties to reach a political settlement and then being installed in a referendum each ethnic group
6937105 various political forces on kirkuk has not yet reached a solution satisfactory to all parties to the conflict

6937143 cia has made its own inquiries overseas and no one no individual and no intelligence service has substantiated suskinds account of habbush or the bogus letter
6937144 at this point the origins of the forgery like the whereabouts of habbush himself remain unclear but this much is certain suskind is off the mark
6937145 theres not a shred of doubt about any of it
6937146 to state what should be obvious it is not the policy or practice of this agency to violate american law
6937147 it is ridiculous to think that the white house would give me such an order and even more ridiculous to think that i would carry it out
6937148 consistently fought with some administration officials to prevent them from overstating the case for iraqi involvement in international terrorism
6937149 for me i just had probably the best game of my career we got in late and i was kind of tired today but a lot of guys say when youre tired you have your best days
6937150 ive heard that so many times and its never really happened to me before until today it was just a good win for us we fought back the whole game
6937151 we got beat up today what are you going to do
6937152 they came out swinging the bats they hit the ball all over the park and out of it
6937153 you know its good to hit a grand slam but i would rather it have been against somebody else
6937154 because neal and i go way back i consider him a friend i have to do my job too but if i could choose someone else i would
6937155 i walked the first guy and put us in a bigger jam than we were already in i put one over the plate and he harris put a good swing on it
6937156 he looks pretty good over there today he swung the bat well
6937157 i know im strong enough to hit the ball out of the park but im not up there trying to hit the ball out of the park
6937158 i dont know where its coming from and im not trying to figure it out
6937159 well miss you very much and well see you in heaven real soon what a reunion we will have no more sorrow no more tears just rejoicing in the presence of our lord and savior jesus christ
6937160 the pole is huge for us this track obviously track position pit stall selection those things are really important
6937161 i had to pedal it pretty hard coming off of turn two because i got back to the gas pretty quick and it shoved the front end a little bit
6937162 all in all it ended up being a pretty good lap it gave us a good pit selection and good starting position
6937163 we would have to be perfect to beat him here said
6937164 youve still got to keep putting one foot in front of the other in the 1 500 meters said clay long after he was finished clays victory was never in doubt
6937165 competing so late the seventh and eighth days of the nine day track competition i got to stand back and watch it said clay after his medal was awarded
6937166 i got to watch a lot of events as much as track is an individual sport youre part of team usa and you want everybody to do well
6937167 theres nothing better than walking down the hallways and everybody has their heads up saying good job said clay
6937168 like we killed it out there there are some people in beijing who can say that and there are some people who cant
6937169 i have received e mails from people across the country particularly about the relays
6937170 vlm airlines is honoured to receive this prestigious award which is a powerful endorsement of service from the people that really matter passengers we are dedicated to providing the highest levels of service and strive continually to set new standards
6937171 this award is particularly pleasing in that it demonstrates quality of service and service clearly matter to customers on short haul services vlm airlines were strongly supported in this survey category and were frequently singled out for the high standards of staff service they deliver the award is very much a recognition of the those customer facing staff
6937172 we are coming apart at the seams in every sense
6937173 nearly two months to have a pair of trousers mended which had been torn by a not completely screwed down screw on a jump seat meanwhile alitalia is back in the news with plans of new cuts they want to make but i have already made my cuts
6937174 once again we are short of cutlery so i am hard at work washing re washing and drying
6937175 there is a meal missing either it wasnt loaded or there are more passengers than we had booked
6937176 the undercarriage is nude without mudguards the plane can only fly if it doesnt rain we are fine until the end of september but only in the south nothing to put security at risk
6937177 if one is not in line with the norms and dictates alitalia does not take off
6937178 international statistics confirm that alitalia is one of the most secure airlines in the world
6937179 perhaps aviator az does not take into account the delicate situation in which we find ourselves

6937205 i had a farm in africa at the foot of the ngong hills
6937206 she asked but i found the feeling was so hard to translate
6937207 obviously it got out of control but to be honest i thought i was in a safe house
6937208 i thought i was part of a community that handled its problems internally and that recognized the dangers of exposing ourselves no pun intended to the rest of the country
6937209 on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama

6937216 anything i know falls under doctor patient confidentiality and i will not break that not even for you
6937217 so thats it four months together and you just decide youre going to go through this alone i dont get a say
6937218 im afraid im not up for that at the moment
6937219 go back to the sgc go back to atlantis just get the hell out
6937220 in two years cervical cancer has gone from obscure killer confined mostly to poor nations to the wests disease of the moment
6937221 merck lobbied every opinion leader womens group medical society politicians and went directly to the people it created a sense of panic that says you have to have this vaccine now
6937222 i would have liked to see it go much slower
6937223 the department of health and human services today formally released proposed regulations that secretary michael leavitt claims are necessary to protect health care providers and institutions who decline to provide certain medical services because those services offend their consciences
6937224 after intense criticism in the mainstream media and from millions of americans hhs has removed an explicit redefinition of contraception as abortion from the regulation in so doing the agency may have created a much larger problem
6937225 last month a seven judge appellate panel in pennsylvania ruled that delivering babies is not the practice of medicine its always comforting when the law catches up to history midwifery is after all the second oldest profession
6937226 consumers worried about salad safety may soon be able to buy fresh spinach and iceberg lettuce zapped with just enough radiation to kill e coli and a few other germs
6937227 the food and drug administration on friday will issue a regulation allowing spinach and lettuce sellers to take that extra step a long awaited move amid increasing outbreaks from raw produce
6937228 its expensive and it doesnt really address the problem at the source
6937229 the notion that morning sickness can sometimes indicate that a girl is on the way may be an exception
6937230 a number of large studies in various countries have examined the claim and almost all have found it to be true with caveats specifically studies have found that it applies to women with morning sickness in the first trimester and with symptoms so severe that it leads to hospitalization a condition known as hyperemesis gravidarum
6937231 im completely smitten with wall e this summers pixar disney offering but the last thing i expected to see in my friendly heterosexual upper east side manhattan neighborhood movie theater was a feature length cartoon about a pair of lesbian robots who fall madly in love with each other
6937232 exactly what they said was that if the dalai lama comes to costa rica hu jintao wont come and thats not convenient for costa rica
6937233 senator mccain has stubbornly focused on maintaining an indefinite us presence in iraq but events have made his bluster and record increasingly out of touch with reality
6937234 while senator mccain continues to offer unconditional military and economic support for iraq i strongly believe that we need to use our leverage with the iraqi government to ensure a political settlement
6937235 i am glad the administration has finally shifted to accepting a timetable for the removal of our combat troops from iraq
6937236 success in iraq depends on an iraqi government that is reconciling its differences and taking responsibility for its future and a timetable is the best way to press the iraqis to do just that
6937237 i welcome the growing convergence around this pragmatic and responsible position
6937238 he is going to say finally we are to the place where we are going to do what i have been calling for ever since we got in and that is to get out
6937239 even in retrospect obama would chose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
6937240 he felt really lonely and wanted to be with his mother and family
6937241 but we should have no illusion that the struggle is over
6937242 restoration of georgias territorial integrity is unimaginable without true internationalization of the peacekeeping
6937243 our troops were able to prevent the huge russian armies advance for three days before the world woke up
6937244 despite our numerous warnings about the possible russian invasion no one paid an attention to it i myself could not imagine that such a large scale incursion would have occurred
6937245 as it seems now it was absolutely impossible to prevent what has happened of course in the condition when no one referring to the international community was interfering
6937246 undertakings given at the 2007 forum in tonga to hold an election by march 2009
6937247 for the first time this pacific islands forum has condemned directly the actions of bainimarama in failing to honour his undertakings to the pacific island leaders a year or so ago
6937248 secondly for the first time the leaders of the pacific islands forum have embraced the possibility of suspension of a member state to be adopted against fiji should they continue not to embrace their undertakings for march 2009 elections
6937249 sanford bernstein put out a fabulous report today may 15 about alternative energy that waxed wonderfully about wind and a little less wonderfully about solar the latter isnt as loved because the average selling price of solar is too high vs the dirty competition
6937250 russia has been in the news because of the events in georgia but recent headlines havent really affected our view of investing in the country
6937251 we have been significantly underweight for some years largely due to concerns regarding corporate governance financial disclosure treatment of minority shareholders and the growing role of the state in the private sector
6937252 we have had issues with things like companies with no independent directors skimpy reporting conflicts of interest and a general lack of transparency
6937253 its not very heartening for investors to see that kind of stuff happening its not what you want to see in a stable investment environment to say the least
6937254 i dont know where oil will end up but lukoil and gazprom are trading at 10 times earnings or so
6937255 relative to what else is out there these guys are still growing earnings so we still like them
6937256 we find high quality companies operating in a lower risk environment with a more predictable growth outlook
6937257 the operating environment is unpredictable and the risks can be significant
6937258 the group of militants opened fire at the surrounding troops resulting in an on the spot death of an army colonel and two soldiers
6937259 in the subsequent gunbattle five militants were killed a search operation is now on in the machil area of the north kashmir kupwara district
6937260 the only demand we make is of freedom india must grant it to us
6937261 the combat troops will withdraw from iraqi cities by june 2009
6937262 both the parties have agreed on this the negotiators job is done now it is up to the leaders
6937263 there are a lot of details that have to be worked out
6937264 they dont really believe that the theater missile defense components in poland and in the czech republic although they are very small are in fact in the end really intended for iran
6937265 the other piece of this is that the russians have opposed the general national military defense program of the united states for a very long time
6937266 and they put the two things together they think this is the camels nose under the tent that the united states is putting in place in alaska now in central europe and who knows where next the components of an effective for a much more extensive ballistic missile defense system that would be directed against russian nuclear capabilities
6937267 the president traveled to georgia august 13 when there was a rally in tbilisi and stood beside georgian president mikhail saakashvili and said now we see the real face of russia
6937268 here is the president of poland clearly suggesting that russia is a serious military threat to all its neighbors that is obviously going to lead to the action that its has taken that is to defend itself as best it can
6937269 the russian military actions in georgia not only broke through whatever resistance the polish government had to doing the deal without getting further satisfaction on the terms of the deal but in addition pushed both sides to build in these extra defensive measures which are clearly directed against russia
6937270 no one raises any question but that the patriot missile battery or batteries that are to be put in poland plus the joint administration and patrolling of them by both u s and polish forces is designed for russia
6937271 if the russians should do anything to attack those missiles and american lives are at risk then that would mean that the debate about whether or not the united states would actually do something to protect members of nato would become academic
6937272 and indeed because american troops were there it would serve as a trigger and the united states would react
6937273 ya basta necesitamos respuestas y necesitamos esperanza esperanza de que ahora s nuestras autoridades estar n unidas y coordinadas para trabajar a favor de m xico ya basta ni un ni o inocente m s ni una madre m s
6937274 vemos con buenos ojos el acuerdo que hoy se firma

6937278 i hope that the russian authorities will rethink their decision to reduce or worse suspend their collaboration with nato

6937324 we want to go beyond what everyone else is doing
6937325 the mobile component is an extension that will help us fulfill our advertisers need to reach consumers
6937326 we test both languages spanish and english and were also testing spanglish
6937327 there are so many big ones like myspace and facebook we think we can be the place for latin music
6937328 you can do a lot with 100 000 said monica gadsby ceo publicis groupes smg multicultural chicago the biggest multicultural media buying group
6937329 some slice budgets as thin as they can but many clients once they see results dont want to jeopardize other media and will fund digital incrementally plenty of clients will invest against results so we should see an increase in overall dollars
6937330 we need to move forward to some collaboration with general market agencies when we need english language media to reach a portion of the hispanic market
6937331 if it makes more sense for a general market agency to buy airtime on abcs ugly betty because they have more leverage so be it
6937332 the trap is that roi is short term and the hispanic market often brings longer term return
6937333 we need tools that help us measure not only short term roi but also how its impacting on the future in the expectation of growth in that sector
6937334 its easy for a media planner in the general market to say i can deliver hispanics to you
6937335 how can a hispanic agency leverage this trend and say its important for us as an industry to create commercials that transcend spanish you need to find a way to position yourselves as more insightful theres also an opportunity for multicultural agencies to develop general market work in the african american market thats happened for many years
6937336 a lot of latin artists are plugged in so if you want to find them its easy if you go to sites like myspace you have to go through all sorts of genres types of music and languages
6937337 its cool that we can break the boundaries and reach out to other countries and have so many people sharing music and talking across international borders
6937338 theres similar types of sites but they dont capture the cultural subtleties we thought theres an opportunity
6937339 can they succeed as a business yes because whenever you have people grouped together they become a target for marketing purposes
6937340 music is a huge part of our culture and people are looking for a way to come together
6937341 more young people come to this country and dont have a family they are here to strive or to study and they need contacts they dont have money to go to shows or clubs but they can reach out to people who also like the same things

6937343 citing sources within the aviation industry abc news reports an overzealous tsa employee attempted to gain access to the parked aircraft by climbing up the fuselage reportedly using the total air temperature tat probes mounted to the planes noses as handholds
6937344 the brilliant employees used an instrument located just below the cockpit window that is critical to the operation of the onboard computers one pilot wrote on an american eagle internet forum
6937345 they decided this instrument the tat probe would be adequate to use as a ladder
6937346 officials with american eagle confirmed to ann the problem was discovered by maintenance personnel who inspected the planes tuesday morning and questioned why the tat probes all gave similar error indications
6937347 one eagle pilot says had the pilots not been so attentive the damaged probes could have caused problems inflight
6937348 are now doing things to our aircraft that may put our lives and the lives of our passengers at risk
6937349 the tsa has no business putting untrained personnel in a position to damage aircraft
6937350 in this case ann strongly recommends and encourages the criminal prosecution of this so called inspector and his immediate supervisors it is a matter of time before one of these morons does something stupid and gets someone killed and with the way these incidents are occurring we believe it is a virtual certainty that a tsa inpector will hurt or kill someone in such a manner
6937351 it doesnt matter that you dont want illegal aliens here there here and theres nothing you can do about it
6937352 my stay in iraq has opened my eyes to just how brutal a country we are we came into this country like a football player back handing a 2 year old for his lollipop we left nothing untouched that had even the slightest effect on the outcome of the war weapons of mass destruction yeah right whatever george

6937412 and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven
6937413 the lords words to the apostle peter in matthew 16 19 as to binding and to all the disciples in 18 18 signify in the former case that the apostle by his ministry of the word of life would keep unbelievers outside the kingdom of god and admit those who believed
6937414 and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved
6937415 then they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day there were added unto them about 3 000 souls
6937416 to him christ give all the prophets witness that through his christs name whosoever believeth in him christ shall receive remission of sins
6937417 for there is one god and one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus
6937418 depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels

6937436 that a people can be enslaved just as effectually by making property of their lands as by making property of their bodies is a truth that conquerors in all ages have recognized and that as society developed the strong and unscrupulous who desired to live off the labor of others have been prompt to use
6937437 that each particular slave should be owned by a particular master would in fact become as social development went own and industrial organization grew complex a manifest disadvantage to the masters
6937438 unable to employ themselves the nominally free laborers are forced by their competition with each other to pay as rent all their earnings above a bare living or to sell their labor for wages which give but a bare living and as landowners the ex slaveholders are enabled as before to appropriate to themselves the labor or the produce of the labor of their former chattels
6937439 but it may be said that the analogy between our industrial system and chattel slavery is only supported by the consideration of extremes
6937440 these objections will be best met by endeavoring to imagine a well developed society like our own in which chattel slavery exists without distinction of race
6937441 in such a society the indolence interest and necessity of the masters would soon develop a class of intermediaries between the completely enslaved and themselves
6937442 and as has always happened where slavery had not race character some of these ex slaves or their children would in the constant movement be always working their way to the highest places so that in such a state of society

6937506 senator mccain has stubbornly focused on maintaining an indefinite us presence in iraq but events have made his bluster and record increasingly out of touch with reality
6937507 while senator mccain continues to offer unconditional military and economic support for iraq i strongly believe that we need to use our leverage with the iraqi government to ensure a political settlement
6937508 i am glad the administration has finally shifted to accepting a timetable for the removal of our combat troops from iraq
6937509 success in iraq depends on an iraqi government that is reconciling its differences and taking responsibility for its future and a timetable is the best way to press the iraqis to do just that
6937510 i welcome the growing convergence around this pragmatic and responsible position
6937511 the news from the fta does not guarantee full funding of the project which is counting on 900 million from washington and has endured years of uncertainty as federal transit officials have questioned its rising costs but state and project officials welcomed the letter and said they think the projects near demise earlier this year is behind them
6937512 some preliminary work including relocation of utility lines has been underway since january the pace of the work will pick up considerably after labor day officials said with more than eight construction sites likely to be in progress along route 7 between the dulles toll road and international drive
6937513 as a result spot closures of the route 7 service road will continue and single lane closures will begin next week along route 7 and gosnell road project spokeswoman marcia mcallister said motorists have encountered lane closures on the ramps from the toll road to route 7 that and other nighttime detours in the area will continue she said
6937514 in addition the project office has instructed metro which will operate the new silver line to begin the process of procuring rail cars

6937518 it was a massive season for me last year and ill always think of going to bolton as a big turning point in my career

6937527 he thaksin said to me if you need me to resign from the football club as a director because it would serve the needs of the premier league then im fine with that as long as that doesnt change any other thing his ownership
6937528 its almost a tongue in cheek term that you would use for premier league football over the last 10 years there are plenty of unfit and improper individuals
6937529 he thaksin has not skipped bail hes not gone back to face the charges
6937530 he wants to be at this ground eastlands on sunday but people may want to come and show their support from his country and he doesnt want to use this as a political platform and there has been a threat to his safety worldwide

6937560 these conditions will ensure that the department has appropriate input and oversight into vanocs ceremony planning
6937561 we just remind vanoc of course that the opening ceremonies are a time for all canadians to be included and to be celebrated as we present canada to the world
6937562 the federal government has not put any restrictions on us
6937563 it speaks to the domestic and international priorities of the government
6937564 we have spent a tremendous amount of time with the government of canada understanding brand canada and what they are taking canada out to the world and to canadians as and were aligned with that
6937565 so i think it would be expected that the government of the day would have input with respect to how an olympic games occur on its own soil
6937566 so i would expect that their political platforms will be part and parcel of the opening ceremonies and anything that contradicts those policies i would see them probably rejecting
6937567 it is a very political event and it always has been
6937568 the conservatives and everybody else would like to show canada as a happy shiny place like beijing has done for its facade as london will do in 2012 its just part and parcel of what the opening ceremonies are all about
6937569 they can certainly say well make it known that youve made conditions that were unacceptable or well simply scale down the size of the opening ceremony
6937570 and if people ask well say the canadian government was only willing to support it if they could have whatever they had in mind
6937571 if they had heard something they certainly would have pushed back
6937572 i think the word appropriate is key to what is meant there
6937573 theyre putting in half they would have a lot to say about what goes in
6937574 its unreasonable i would say that someone would give you 20 million blindly and say here go do whatever you want
6937575 i tend to stockpile them and wait until i can do something big and significant and have a really great memorable experience
6937576 i think the natural instinct is to hoard and collect and to get something for nothing
6937577 in none of these programs are you really getting something for nothing
6937578 because you have to change your behaviour to accumulate at a particular partner
6937579 its a unique skill and its transferable to almost any other market
6937580 were there first were the only loyalty company in the world that is a pure company that is publicly quoted in other words the only business were in is loyalty
6937581 there are not that many canadian businesses these days that are actually acquiring overseas and building overseas as opposed to being gobbled up and spat out
6937582 theres a very interesting balance of frustration versus hoarding behaviour that as a loyalty company you need to monitor and keep at a particular point
6937583 theres no hard and fast rule on this but it appears its somewhere around 80 per cent
6937584 i know that if we went higher than that people would actually spend the currency faster they would tend to and i dont mean to sound pejorative they would fritter it away and they would never get the big reward that we know influences their long term brand loyalty and their behaviour
6937585 we destroy the economics because people dont hoard and the miles dont break
6937586 if your conclusion is all the dissatisfaction on that 80 20 metric is related to air redemption the answer would be absolutely yes
6937587 we have no objective at this point to improve that raw metric of customer satisfaction
6937588 what makes the redemption option so superior from a travel rewards perspective is that there are no seat restrictions and the avion card holder is not limited to one airline
6937589 its very easy to be seduced by a glossy ad
6937590 the reality underneath is perhaps not as shining as it looks
6937591 collectors began to collect from more sponsors than before they increased the number of points earned by about 10 per cent in the month of redemption and earned more points after redemption than before this redemption effect was even more pronounced when collectors redeemed for more aspirational rewards like themes park admissions or flights
6937592 the weekly spending at sainsburys was 40 per cent greater among people collecting from sainsburys and two other sponsors than if they earned points from sainsburys alone
6937593 thats really what were saying to retailers not only do we have a great program and weve got lots of up market canadians and they spend lots of money more than 80 per cent of canadian households with incomes in excess of 100 000 have one or more aeroplan members but we also have this coalition effect as other retailers join you the retailers all do better
6937594 the principle is if aeroplan partners with somebody then the brand equity that is intrinsic in aeroplan gets transferred to that partner and therefore the person becomes loyal to that partner as well
6937595 the higher up the consumer goes in terms of their disposable income the less likely they are to be brand loyal
6937596 only when the customer feels that they are getting good value
6937597 its probably the single most important thing weve done in the aeroplan program in the last couple of years
6937598 if you think about it for a retailer its quite a brave thing to do because youre saying my brand is not strong enough on its own to attract some of the customers i really want therefore i need to join forces with somebody who has a brand that people are already associated with
6937599 shoppers has probably the best monoline scheme in the country
6937600 it sure as hell seems to work for them in terms of providing information about their customers which is what theyre after what it doesnt do is encourage somebody to hoard the currency and save for the big thing
6937601 weve led the industry by proving the hypothesis that this could be a stand alone company
6937602 we want national brands that are big and strong and where you can have an exclusive relationship and pretty much any consumer in the country whichever town or city they live in they can say oh these guys are the plans partner
6937603 by having the airline as the majority owner you sort of put a pair of training wheels on it as you go forward
6937604 were also talking in a number of markets about starting in the retail area putting together three or four retail programs like we did in the u k and then later bringing in the airline
6937605 we think both ways of doing it are just as good
6937606 we bought nectar without any clear view of who the right airline might be
6937607 there are three or four choices there it could take us a couple of years to get the airline in but thats the objective
6937608 you only have to think of any time youve been to the u s everything there has to do with price its price first and quality second
6937609 say we invest 500 million in a united or an american the chances of us being able to ipo that and see a return on our money would totally depend on the airline not going into bankruptcy again and in the u s thats a tough call so the way to do it for us in the u s is probably to wait until one of them gets into trouble and then work with the potential new owners as part of exiting bankruptcy

6937618 his infancy was not rosy because we were a modest family and only our father was working it was a difficult period following the war
6937619 mario was a strong rider not too much of a winner but often among the first places of the classification he sacrificed a lot for the team during a break away or to block while a companion took a flight for victory
6937620 i met mario when i was 17 and he was 16 we were in a gym and we became friends even though we raced for different clubs mario was of good character and he got along with everyone even when he was racing he was generous and highly esteemed for his passion of cycling he distinguished himself from the other fellows for the attention maintenance and care that he had for his bicycle
6937621 mario was always adjusting my bicycle and he even taught me how to pick wild mushrooms
6937622 mario did not win a lot of races but he was strong generous and always ready to help everyone
6937623 when mario stopped racing he didnt know what to do the passion he had for the bike was still strong so he learned right away how to build racing frames he became a specialist in building racing frames and to make himself known in the field he gave me a track bike it was a real jewel with it i won three italian professional individual pursuit championships 1970 at varese 1971 at milano and 1972 at bassano del grappa
6937624 we presented mario to the famous masi of milano in the beginning masi brought work to verona for mario at the time the bike market was slow in italy so with the masi project he transferred to california in search of better luck
6937625 mario respected the mexican guys who helped him they would often have lunch together mario enjoyed the tortillas these men would come up from mexico and make a sacrifice to take care of their families send home every penny these were the people that mario admired people who worked hard and took care of their families he was so old world
6937626 hey mario i love your bikes and i want another bicycle
6937627 before i received the masi i was riding a rickerts and before that a paramount i went to the masi factory at carlsbad and i was measured for the frame which mario then built i wanted an all around track frame that would be good for sprinting the ride of the bike was tremendous
6937628 he worked like a fiend i would have to tear him out of the place in la he would not leave until it was spotless clean i would help him sweep the floor anything to get him out of there
6937629 mario made beautiful stuff and he pushed the american builders beyond a look that we all had which was kind of simple plain lines he forced us to class up our act marios frames were the first to combine american quality and the italian look that had never been done before fairly rapidly after that the americans made their frames look slicker
6937630 after seeing confentes bikes at the new york show it was clear that he raised the standard
6937631 i remember asking myself what could a builder possible do to a frame to make it cost so much more
6937632 mario pulled into the driveway in his car i was surprised to see him i asked him what he was doing here and in his thick italian accent he said that he was here to build bicycles
6937633 i left mario i went to houston for a while i wanted to get married and i knew that he would never marry me he sent a lot of money home to italy yet mario thought you had to have a lot of money to be married i had a little house in encinitas and i believed that we would be all right when i realized it wasnt going to work out i said that im out of here weve been together for five years and there is no future mario was bummed out and very lonely after i left california six months later when i returned from texas he asked me to marry him
6937634 he was going to go back to masi to work for a short time just to make some cash he was supposed to meet with the masi foreman that morning he was really upset and stressed about going back there i felt like it was something he didnt want to do yet he felt he had to
6937635 lady lady there is a man out here and i think he is dead
6937636 advocates and supporters of universal preschool often use existing research for purely political purposes
6937637 but the solid evidence for the effectiveness of early interventions is limited to those conducted on disadvantaged populations
6937638 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
6937639 its becoming time to give some credit to the in ring efforts of mark henry

6937720 if were serious about promoting breastfeeding in this country theres a whole lot more we can do
6937721 i seem to be alone in being fed by the mother
6937722 i hesitate to think what i would have been doing with my life if i had not found this
6937723 i am turning over in my mind the juxtaposition of the spiritual and the practical
6937724 we are of the lineage of shan tao and honen shonin the pureland lineage of japan which we follow faithfully we are organisationally independent in the west but we revere honen and all his great disciples not just some of them
6937725 we have our own form of meditation which is nei quan true insight reflection but for us as for the buddha this is an auxiliary practice our primary practice is nembutsu nei quan gives us insight into the working of dependent origination in ones own case through that means we learn who and what we are at the end of the day however what matters in buddhist practice is to let go of who you are and simply accept the universal grace of the tathagatas as shakyamuni does in all the great mahayana scriptures and that is what nembutsu means to us and that is why nembutsu is the supreme practice in our school
6937726 we now have within our own ranks a growing group of good teachers well experienced in dharma and we also have the great benefit of accomplished and inspiring teachers who come to us from japan to show us the traditional ways
6937727 i am a spiritual person and i am embraced by the spirit everywhere
6937728 i am an ordinary person calling out to that which is most good true and exquisite
6937729 infinite light be my delight shine on me an ordinary
6937730 i am here this is me just as i am
6937731 see the wooden figure sings and the stone maiden dances
6937732 infinite is the buddha way we vow to fulfil it completely

6937734 great things are not done by impulse but by a series
6937735 financial entities like banks broker dealers regional banks finance companies and insurance companies need credit at reasonable rates in order to finance themselves
6937736 for many regional banks like keycorp zions regions and national city the door has already shut on them if they wanted to raise capital in the debt market at levels where their outstanding issues regularly trade they would have to pay 12 15 hardly economic levels
6937737 then there are the good banks like j p morgan and wells fargo j p morgan recently sold 600 million of preferred stock at 8 3 4 and wells fargo sold 1 3 billion at 8 5 8 plus underwriting fees
6937738 below i offer up a few guesses of what other issuers would have to pay to issue preferred stock lehman brothers 11 13 merrill lynch 11 12 morgan stanley 9 10 citigroup 9 1 2 10 1 2 cit group 12 15 fannie mae freddie mac 15 keycorp 11 13 national city 13 15 wachovia 10 12 zions bancorp 13 15 gm gmac not possible washington mutual not possible ford not possible
6937739 rf regions financial needs to raise 2 billion says sanford bernstein lets see what are their options they can sell debt the problem here is that you couldnt sell debt if you wanted the last reported trade in rf paper was 2 weeks ago nearly 700 to the 30 year or close to 12 their preferreds trade at 10 and the stock is now a single digit midget near 8 a share so if you could even get a deal done shareholders would get a 50 haircut
6937740 regional banks including midwest bank holdings inc sovereign bancorp and frontier financial corp may have the most to lose melrose park illinois based midwest has 67 5 million or as much as 23 percent of its risk weighted assets in the preferred stock while philadelphia based sovereign owns about 623 million and everett washington based frontier about 5 million

6937746 dazu kann m ntefering einen beitrag leisten er ist aufgrund seiner politischen lebensleistung ein anerkannter und glaubw rdiger politiker
6937747 der auftritt von m ntefering in bayern ist ein ganz normaler vorgang wir sind beide langj hrige politische freunde seine wahlkampf unterst tzung ist ein erfreulicher aber eigentlich selbstverst ndlicher akt der freundschaft und der kollegialit t mehr aber auch nicht
6937748 die spd ist f r die b rger eine gesamtmarke davon kann man sich als landesverband nie ganz abkoppeln
6937749 trotz aller begleitmusik aus anderen l ndern glaube ich dass die menschen wissen es geht hier allein um die zukunft bayerns da z hlen nur bayerische themen und auch bayerische pers nlichkeiten ein erfolg wird unserer sein und ein misserfolg ebenso
6937750 es ist m glich dass die csu unter die absolute mehrheit f llt
6937751 deshalb greift sie zu alten angstparolen sie spricht davon dass nur ein csu w hler ein anst ndiger bayer sei und jetzt warnt sie auch noch vor h lle und satan das wird ihr mehr schaden als nutzen die bayern sind aufgekl rte leute die genau wissen was sie an ihrer spd haben

6937817 omigosh are you kidding sweetie gore is not vice president he lost in the election to george bush you are so dumb
6937818 this is a concert but its also like a weird concert
6937819 i usually just put it somewhere between the s and the a
6937820 so let me get this straight you do not know for sure how to write your own name
6937821 there have been reports that a plane has crashed into the world trade center i do not know whether my friends are safe either but for now i think we should focus on the task at hand
6937822 voting rights of convicted felons convicted misdemeanants and pretrial detainees
6937823 why do we fight this hard in war if we dont learn from it
6937824 they put us on what you call the hitler highway on the highway we saw massacres of people being slaughtered off the highway
6937825 you could see people of all ages hanging on barbed wire they had been shot or were being shot at
6937826 on april 11 1945 the village hottelstedt was the point of departure of the patrol of combat team 9 6th armored division u s third army which discovered the concentration camp of buchenwald
6937827 i hope that this american heros family reads these comments and knows that his sacrifice has touched people around the country and around the world in an age of hubris and ego of warfare and terrorism this humble man truly exemplifies what i would like to think being an american really stands for
6937828 people like mr hoyt are real heroes and truly show the goodness that humans are capable of this modest quiet man is now sitting at the right hand of god and he will hold that place of honor for eternity
6937829 im the last living of the first four american soldiers who liberated buchenwald concentration camp
6937830 there were thousands of bodies piled high i saw hearts that had been taken from live people in medical experiments
6937831 im not saying my dad was a hero to every person in the world but im saying he certainly had a heroic approach and outlook and definitely went above and beyond a persons call of duty to understand the atrocities of war
6937832 they say alls fair in love and war well some of these things werent so fair especially if you were a member of an ethnic group or cultural group that didnt suit the people of power you were scheduled to be obliterated and thats not ok thats not what democracy and freedom is all about
6937833 besides all of the horror and disbelief and shocking things that come out of war there are also the caring human sides and moral aspects of what we need to learn why do we fight this hard in war and put ourselves and others through it if we dont learn from it
6937834 iisent there some kind of liability to asking an emplyee to lose weight
6937835 i love running i had an op on my leg recently so im not allowed to run at the moment which is driving me mad
6937836 the notion that somehow as a consequence of me knowing somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago when i was eight years old somehow reflects on me and my values doesnt make any sense
6937837 dig it first they killed those pigs then they ate dinner in the same room with them they even shoved a fork into the victims stomach
6937838 kill all rich people break up their cars and apartments bring the revolution home kill your parents
6937839 i dont regret the bombs i feel we didnt do enough
6937840 for the past few days our phone has just been ringing off the hook
6937841 obviously it got out of control but to be honest i thought i was in a safe house
6937842 i thought i was part of a community that handled its problems internally and that recognized the dangers of exposing ourselves no pun intended to the rest of the country
6937843 obviously it got out of control but to be honest i thought i was in a safe house
6937844 i thought i was part of a community that handled its problems internally and that recognized the dangers of exposing ourselves no pun intended to the rest of the country
6937845 brad and i text back and forth and matt and i text back and forth everybodys got new babies now so its really cool
6937846 now you know my kids are at the age where they can be babysitting their kids
6937847 it is great to be going back and im feeling really joyful at this moment
6937848 what happened was very bad and extremely painful for us this is our territory this is our country and we werent allowed to enter our own city
6937849 to crack down on criminals as we still expect there to be looters and common criminals in the city when we arrive
6937850 ada empat tim yang akan memperebutkan scudetto tapi inter bakal dapat persaingan alot milan juga akan berburu scudetto juga seperti fiorentina dan roma
6937851 the mexicans are like breaking into my house there ruining everything they wont leave we need stronger border security
6937852 the rundown team includes miss boogie comedienne v ness and the no
6937853 but it doesnt make any sense do you think it adds to the piece
6937854 dont you think thats a little unfair to your readers
6937855 hey asshole touch this bike and ill appear from the bushes ready to club you with a two by four
6937856 i have received handwritten notes on several occasions from saks
6937857 im a note writer so i appreciate the action and thought
6937858 its a way of engaging the customer and protecting the relationship they have
6937859 my answer to the question do the affluent have less money to spend
6937860 the affluent shopper feels like they have less money when they feel less affluent they are less likely to spend money on luxury nobody really needs any of the stuff in the luxury category
6937861 she might buy less but she is still coming in because she wants the quality of merchandise we offer

6938180 in government people often spend vast sums of money to make sure nothing happens at all
6938181 if cash equals friendship then john mccain and the oil industry are best friends
6938182 mccain has taken 1 4 million from oil industry employees more than any other politician and
6938183 but in government people often spend vast sums of money to make sure nothing happens at all
6938184 its unlikely big money is the only reason congress hasnt acted on energy legislation
6938185 you put the dysfunctionality and the sharp partisan issues together and the failure to get a bill is easy to describe
6938186 the oil industry says it has spent heavily on lobbying this year because it has been the target of so many bills
6938187 but to say nothings happened because of this money i dont agree with that
6938188 the oil industry may have not gotten its drilling wish list just yet but so far they have been able to avoid higher taxes
6938189 maybe they know who their friends are and they have other means of influencing them
6938190 people have absorbed the fact that its a real crisis and it will take complicated solutions to solve
6938191 obama best hope thats the case although mccain is well ahead of him in total oil money raised employees at some of the biggest firms seem to favor the junior senator from illinois
6938192 they invest in people and they like to invest in people that will be around forever

6938196 that to me is the most striking part about it transmitting 60 watts at 75 percent efficiency over several feet
6938197 the power pack for your laptop isnt that efficient its one of those things thats almost too good to be true
6938198 for me its like a confirmation that its so exciting its something people would like to have
6938199 now the question is if its feasible or not its exciting that theyre also inspired and it seems closer to reality every day

6938201 indians tend to buy the most fancy cell phones and the iphone has a massive fan following everywhere
6938202 it is seen as a status symbol an aspirational product so you can expect to see not just the rich but also tech savvy youngsters and people in small towns buying it

6938204 j t osullivan will be our starting quarterback going into the season and im expecting him to succeed

6938206 this hasnt been a case of alex and shaun not performing well
6938207 this has been a case of j t performing very well thats why we are where we are j t has very good command of the offense hes played well in all three preseason games and now its time for us to get ready for the regular season
6938208 when you think about the six seven cars that are still battling that out eight cars maybe those eight cars are in a position where finishing 12th is way better than finishing 38th
6938209 you dont want to go out there and risk running out of fuel or anything but theres not a lot you can do here
6938210 a lot of the wrecks that you end up finding yourselves in here are because of something that happened two or three cars ahead of you
6938211 just getting caught up in something so long as i dont make any mistakes have lapses in judgment and we dont get caught up in something i think we should be pretty good
6938212 youve got to be sharp youve got to be on your game theres no time to take a breath around this place it is very very fast and thats what makes it fun and exciting
6938213 i think it creates excitement burton said and the chance that a driver whose team has done well all year could fade with a difficult three week run is all a part of it
6938214 thats what i have worked for to get where i am now i am not where i want to be but i am where i need to be to move forward this is the next big test
6938215 a lot of the faces here are new but we have had a lot of success together
6938216 me and cash have been in a lot of conversations over the years this was definitely one of the better ones
6938217 no question if he pitches well and we win its a great story for everyone
6938218 thats the situation were in right now we need to find ways to win its good for him to be back to be healthy and hopefully he pitches well for us
6938219 hopefully there are no more setbacks hopefully he goes out there and helps us to win
6938220 for me i just had probably the best game of my career we got in late and i was kind of tired today but a lot of guys say when youre tired you have your best days
6938221 ive heard that so many times and its never really happened to me before until today it was just a good win for us we fought back the whole game
6938222 we got beat up today what are you going to do
6938223 they came out swinging the bats they hit the ball all over the park and out of it
6938224 you know its good to hit a grand slam but i would rather it have been against somebody else
6938225 because neal and i go way back i consider him a friend i have to do my job too but if i could choose someone else i would
6938226 i walked the first guy and put us in a bigger jam than we were already in i put one over the plate and he harris put a good swing on it
6938227 he looks pretty good over there today he swung the bat well
6938228 i know im strong enough to hit the ball out of the park but im not up there trying to hit the ball out of the park
6938229 i dont know where its coming from and im not trying to figure it out
6938230 instead of getting stuff at the fair you can give something at the fair
6938231 we were dead equal clint and i keselowski said after climbing from his car in the cloud of smoke of a just completed burnout
6938232 i needed to catch a break and he gave it to me car owner dale earnhardt jr greeted keselowski after the finish
6938233 it was good right up until whatever lap that was where i made a mistake he said adding that he tried too quickly to get back on the gas coming out of the second turn
6938234 it came out from underneath me there and i had to check up or i would have spun out
6938235 its been a frustrating two months for me bowyer said
6938236 its good when you can be frustrated with second but we did give one away today when you look at it it was obvious
6938237 allow the audience to gain a different perspective as an unrecognizable object when put together
6938238 the governments conduct in this case is off the charts extreme
6938239 the government has to verify that these assets are not assets they are account holders assets
6938240 i told everyone to stand down right now we are unable to run the business we are unable to make deposits or requests for withdrawal
6938241 the goal is to get assets returned so customers can get their money back
6938242 the driver told me the vehicle got in his lane and he tried to avoid a collision and went to his right and lost control
6938243 i proved to the u s dot that i had new brakes on that bus i was able to show them using invoices
6938244 no i dont think its misleading because i dont have any kind of advertising in houston
6938245 as a matter of fact no one knew i existed in houston until the accident
6938246 i guess people keep working further north as work in the south declines
6938247 theyre going up north where the work is more plentiful and paid at a better rate
6938248 evidence collected during this investigation revealed that there is a substantial continuity of operations between green river buses llc and autobuses rio verde
6938249 i want somebody who is going to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policy making
6938250 this is his decision and i expect him to make it however he feels is best
6938251 obviously doesnt have a very clear sense of what ordinary americans are going through
6938252 maybe mccain thinks this economy is working for folks like him but how are things going for you
6938253 if congress wants to shut down one avenue we will go down another
6938254 if it was illegal for at amp t to turn over the data then it was illegal for government to receive it
6938255 the pullback of russian troops and units passed without incident and was completed on time
6938256 russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
6938257 if needed we reserve the right to boost these forces
6938258 i do not believe that these actions can seriously contribute to the stabilisation of the situation in the region
6938259 we are negotiating with several operators in ksa oman yemen palestine
6938260 cbo projects that outlays will first exceed revenues in 2019 and that the social security trust funds will be exhausted in 2049 if the law remains unchanged the social security administration ssa will then no longer have the legal authority to pay full benefits
6938261 cbos projections indicate that future social security beneficiaries will receive larger benefits in retirement and will have paid higher payroll taxes than current beneficiaries do even after adjustments have been made for inflation and even if the scheduled payments are reduced because the trust funds are exhausted however cbo estimates that under both scenarios those benefits will represent a smaller percentage of beneficiaries preretirement earnings than is the case now
6938262 the 75 year actuarial imbalance in the program amounts to 0 38 percent of gdp or 1 06 percent of taxable payroll

6938265 een advertentie gelijk hierboven weergegeven kan naar haar aard en inhoud slechts worden aangemerkt als een uitnodiging tot het doen van een aanbod nu daarin o m niet is aangeduid op welke termijn de juridische en feitelijke levering kan plaatsvinden en wie van pp de kosten van transport voor haar rekening zou moeten nemen welke punten van essentieel belang zijn voor het tot stand komen van een koopovereenkomst m b t een woonhuis bovendien kan een potenti le verkoper gelijk hofland velerlei redenen hebben om de ene bieder te prefereren boven de andere waarbij te denken valt aan redenen gelegen in de solvabiliteit en of de persoon van een bepaalde bieder en of gelegen in de bereidheid van een bieder om te betalen resp meer te betalen voor de overname van stoffering en dergelijke

6938509 thats the only thing i can say is the players
6938510 you take kobe bryant and carmelo anthony and you put dwyane wade in and you put chris paul in you put jason kidd lebron james dwight howard
6938511 youre seeing a kind of college atmosphere with everyone cheering for one another its all about each other not about i if you had put this team on the court back in 2004 maybe it was a different outcome
6938512 we wasnt a team in 2004 we were a bunch of individuals put on a basketball team we didnt have much time to prepare and we didnt take care of business and look at it like it was our last game every game we played it hurt us

6938517 je crois que le mot appropri dit tout ici ils investissent la moiti ils ont beaucoup dire sur ce qui sy retrouvera
6938518 its really crazy i got a small taste of it when i was home last but nothing like this
6938519 the most pressure comes two minutes before you go on stage to sing after that its just try and relax and have fun you want to be happy with yourself but you also want to try and impress the judges they have the influence
6938520 ive gotten away with playing pretty not well known stuff right and its gotten me this far so im going to keep doing what im doing and just hope for the best
6938521 its just the four of us left and were a really tight bunch were there to support one another and thats a big help
6938522 mom being a big cape breton step dancer and traditional music was always around us and dad was a big music fan in general especially country music
6938523 mitch is doing so well but every week when you watch that show its just like your heart stops for a half hour you just want him to keep going its just been incredible
6938524 if its meant to be whatever happens happens its a little overwhelming im getting a little more used to it now
6938525 hes the same ol mitch absolutely it seems to suit him hes just smiling all the day
6938526 its hard to hold back the tears im really really happy to see him and hold him again
6938527 we knew that the town and the county were very much behind him but it was pretty overpowering to see so many come out for this show
6938528 i vote for him every night we stay up as long as we can to vote for him he has a great voice and he has a nice personality
6938529 theres so many things i can say about him and theyre all good
6938530 i wouldnt be going where im going if i hadnt had the opportunity to engage in research here
6938531 essentially the things you learn in class are applicable immediately to the research youre doing
6938532 a big part of graduate school is very very deeply rooted in research
6938533 thats what i want to do is to get into research
6938534 what frustrates me more than anything is nobody wants to do anything about it
6938535 one guy got killed how many more got to get killed before they do something
6938536 theyre coming up spar road theyre coming up victoria road
6938537 im on brooks street and its dirt its not paved so they drive on it
6938538 now its just as bad as it was if not worse than two years ago
6938539 weve never given them permission but theyre next to impossible to stop
6938540 wed prefer they didnt they put big ruts in the grass especially in spring theyre a pain theres no question
6938541 nine times out of 10 i dont call police because they dont do nothing anyway
6938542 they come out to the house then turn around and go back whats the sense in having a law if theyre not going to enforce it
6938543 i havent filed formal complaints because i know what those guys are up against
6938544 aside from me putting up big barriers i dont know what they can do
6938545 the only prevention is education and most of the people doing this dont care anyway
6938546 they put an atv sign on the corner of brooks and gatacre and they stole it
6938547 that only lasted three weeks i told the police they stole it and they said no sense putting another one up because theyll just take it down again
6938548 you can have all the signs you want but if you got nobody enforcing it its not worth the jesus paper its written on
6938549 each of our clubs we have trail wardens and if we saw someone who was in an area they werent supposed to be wed talk to them
6938550 the problem around here is the ones who dont belong to the club and they dont respect the law or nothing
6938551 most of the guys involved in these clubs theyre not the ones causing the problems
6938552 is anybody specifically targeting blueberry hill for atvs i cant specifically say
6938553 no doubt thered be our normal patrol we have a car in the pier 24 7
6938554 if any person has a complaint wed normally send a car down
6938555 theyll take his complaint now where itll go i cant say its like any investigation
6938556 in this situation i dont know there is no closure
6938557 i have no anger or anything for him because hes a junkie junkies do stuff like that but hes not the one she took it nobody held a gun to her head and said take this it was her choice
6938558 if i would have known about it it would have been completely different i did what i could i dont know what else i could have done
6938559 only people in the world can read this can you
6938560 you can do whatever you want if you want it bad enough
6938561 it is my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
6938562 anybody brave enough to get 115 200bps how about 230 400bps
6938563 la gente de las agencias de seguridad georgianas me pidieron que bloqueara p ginas rusas

6938568 state laws restricting the use of medicaid funds in paying for abortions
6938569 i havent seen the social science literature that youre obviously much more privy to and obviously sending me
6938570 i would be at a loss to say anything other than i cant support the senator at that point
6938571 work to reduce the incidence of the practice of abortion
6938572 if i said it quite that categorically thats not quite where im at
6938573 there is little in the way of good social science data to evaluate how many of these programs will actually affect the incidence of abortion
6938574 no more left or right time for a new catholic action
6938575 preacher man barack obama and the the gospel of liberalism
6938576 give me the grace good lord to set the world at naught to set my mind fast upon thee and not to hang upon the blast of mens mouths to be content to be solitary not to long for worldly company but utterly to cast off the world and rid my mind of the business thereof
6938577 the ordinary acts we practice every day at home are of more importance to the soul than their simplicity might suggest
6938578 what does it avail to know that there is a god which you not only believe by faith but also know by reason what does it avail that you know him if you think little of him
6938579 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated
6938580 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour
6938581 isnt matrixsynth better than a big cuppa cocoa amp a christmas cookie on a cold cold southern california morning
6938582 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on
6938583 part of the reason we stepped aside is because we didnt agree with their choices
6938584 they contacted chavez to do most of their work i have not used that firm in the past and have concerns with their business practices ziemba waid was very gung ho about using the people they wanted
6938585 im still fairly skeptical its not going to appear on the ballot im sure theyre going to mount every legal argument they can muster
6938586 i dont want to leave people with the impression its underwater permanently
6938587 we delivered them to the ziemba wade office and they were returned by the ziemba wade office
6938588 we sent a letter to lobbyist and time founder marty schultz advising him they were in my office a couple of days before they filed their signatures the governors office was copied on that as well they are still in my office
6938589 early on they had mentioned that they believed we were not quote authorized to collect signatures on their behalf and then later said they were verifying theirs as they went along and they felt theirs were somehow better than mine or that mine might have been a problem
6938590 i dont know who made the decision on behalf of the campaign
6938591 it certainly appears that it would have been prudent for them to take the signatures
6938592 the problem is with the secretary of state not us
6938593 we think however there were mistakes made with the secretary of states office
6938594 he didnt want to be involved in it and now for whatever reason hes trying to stir some gunk around it
6938595 single handedly prove that the american economy is doing just fine when all of these people are paying so much money just to amuse themselves
6938596 how do you look so good for a woman of fifty

6938603 obama decided he didnt need a playmate he needed someone who knows where the mens room is in the white house
6938604 i think its always great for kansas to be mentioned in a very positive way
6938605 this certainly has been a very positive light for kansas i think thats always good news
6938606 obama will see a significant bump and believe it is reasonable to expect nearly a 15 point bounce out of a convention in this political environment
6938607 presidential races are close and we expect this one to be no different but they should figure out how to spin the fact that john mccain owns a dozen houses and thinks the fundamentals of our economy are strong before trying to spin our convention
6938608 god forbid we should ever be twenty years without such a rebellion the people cannot be all and always well informed the part which is wrong will be discontented in proportion to the importance of the facts they misconceive if they remain quiet under such misconceptions it is lethargy the forerunner of death to the public liberty and what country can preserve its liberties if its rulers are not warned from time to time that this people preserve the spirit of resistance let them take arms the remedy is to set them right as to the facts pardon and pacify them what signify a few lives lost in a century or two the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants it is its natural manure
6938609 obviously they are going to talk about the six party talks obviously recent discussions about the verification package which we have been calling on the north koreans to produce
6938610 going to assess where things are with north korea in his conversations with north korean officials
6938611 the us government wants to see this verification package as soon as possible so that we can move forward with this delisting
6938612 the united states has not kept its promise to remove us from the list of states sponsoring terrorism up until today past the deadline which is crucial to the complete implementation of the agreement
6938613 this is a clear violation of the action for action principle which is the basis for the realization of denuclearization
6938614 the pullback of russian troops and units passed without incident and was completed on time
6938615 russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
6938616 if needed we reserve the right to boost these forces
6938617 i do not believe that these actions can seriously contribute to the stabilisation of the situation in the region
6938618 withdraw the us troops from iraq by end of 2011
6938619 the combat troops will withdraw from iraqi cities by june 2009 both the parties have agreed on this
6938620 the negotiators job is done now it is up to the leaders
6938621 the balance were trying to reach is between iraqs stated desire to have a more concrete view of us forces levels out through the years and our desire it be based on conditions on the ground
6938622 i am glad the administration has finally shifted to accepting a timetable for the removal of our combat troops from iraq
6938623 there is a provision that says the withdrawal could be done even before 2011 or extended beyond 2011 depending on the security situation

6938648 we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light
6938649 the vedic literatures describe this material world as darkness actually it is dark and therefore we require sunlight moonlight and electricity if it were not by nature dark why would we require so many arrangements for artificial light the vedas enjoin that we should not remain in darkness tamasi ma jyotir gama we are instructed to go to the light and that light is the spiritual world

6938667 i trace this all back 20 years ago to 1988 this was all brought about by that he had that horrible decision that was taken from him everybody was up in arms about it they were talking about removing boxing from the olympics so they had to do something to save the sport so they came up with this so called computer system when you look back now and remember how earth shattering that controversy was over roy jones jr that seems like a papercut compared to the hemorrhaging thats going on here and now this situation here is so much bigger the scope is so much larger you wonder where this sport is going to wind up

6938721 the dream to provide electricity across the country by signing the indo us nuclear deal is not true
6938722 nuclear power is not a safe affordable or better option for producing electricity rather nuclear power is a very dangerous and expensive option the indo us nuclear deal is actually a political and military deal
6938723 and god said let there be light and there was
6938724 theres all the difference in the world between one who says that the bible merely contains the word of god and one who says that the bible is the word of god if it merely contains the word of god then we are free to pick and choose what parts of the bible we believe to be the word of god but if the bible is the word of god then we are not free to pick and choose but must obey it both when we like what it says and when we dont
6938725 you search the scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life and these are they that bear witness to me
6938726 ive begun smoking again i know you guys are going to kick the shit out of me my family is already doing that
6938727 one of the easiest ways to significantly bring down number of children and youth who get initiated to tobacco use in india without any budgetary allocation for this public health exercise is to remove depiction of tobacco use in films and tv
6938728 the deal has been pushed forward in india in an anti democratic manner without approval of the parliament in fact in the teeth of opposition by a large majority of parliamentarians
6938729 the deal has the potential of disturbing regional stability and further distorting indias relationships with important neighbours like china pakistan and iran this cannot also but severely undermine the prospects for both vertical and horizontal non proliferation and thereby the prospects for global nuclear disarmament
6938730 most importantly it will be a set back to the environmentally friendly sustainable ways of meeting our energy requirements power from nuclear energy is a failed project in developed countries and the eagerness of the prime minister to clinch the deal fails to generate any enthusiasm among the common people of india neither is nuclear energy a solution to global warming as some experts make it out to be on the contrary the entire nuclear fuel cycle is fraught with danger and exposes human beings to hazardous radiation the world is yet to find a safe way for disposal of radioactive waste a factor which is constraining the growth of nuclear power programmes in the developed countries
6938731 we take strong objection to the joint indo us military exercises that have been taking place for the last seven years with the aim of building interoperability and we demand immediate closure of the counter insurgency and jungle warfare school at vairengte in mizoram the increasing militarization of the india state is also being used to crush civil liberties and democratic movements in the country india must learn a lesson from the history of us military involvement in various parts of the world
6938732 we appreciate the consistent stand taken by the left front a partner in the upa alliance in successfully stalling the indo us nuclear deal up till now and hope that the india specific agreement with the international atomic energy agency iaea will never be finalized even as we note their foresight in foiling the us hegemonic designs in south asia we also expect them to take a principled stand against the nuclear power programme we believe that the iaea safeguards must be implemented nationally and internationally on all declared and undeclared nuclear activities including that of israel and us the government of india must also make its nuclear related activities transparent and accountable to the people especially those who are directly affected by radiation
6938733 a man who for 30 years has dedicated his life to the service of the poor cannot be branded as a threat to the country
6938734 if gandhiji could have successfully used satyagraha to make the british listen to us then we expect our own government in chhattisgarh and delhi to listen to the voices of thousands of indian citizens from all over the world demanding the abrogation of the draconian laws if every voice raised against the government atrocities is curbed then what is the use of a democracy
6938735 we must do more to raise awareness about this cause we pray for the people in india and usa from various groups such as chattisgarh mukti morcha asha parivar national alliance of peoples movement napm aid and others that are fasting for the release of dr binayak sen
6938736 these protests are not only about the violation of the human rights of dr sen they are also about the ongoing assault on the human rights of the people of chhattisgarh whose lives and lands are being mortgaged to a vision of development that is antithetical to them
6938737 the contentious issue is 600 mw 4x150 loharinag pala dam being built by national thermal power corporation ntpc a central government undertaking the countrys largest power generation company ganga will be put into 26 and 17 km long tunnels leading to its disappearance from its natural course through the stretch the construction is going on in full steam the resultant destruction of the fragile and unique ecosystem will have far reaching consequences not only this all this is done in earthquake zone 5 and terrain full of sedimentary rocks no imagination is required to realize what one earthquake would to the entire region siltation is another problem ganga and all other himalayan rivers carry lots of silt along which will now settle in the reservoirs created by the dams reducing the electricity generation capacity repeated closing of nathpa jhakri dam on satluj in himachal pradesh 4 years after its commission is a fine example
6938738 in the name of development and economic growth in india rural and urban poor have been the worst hit facing displacement and dispossession at an unprecedented scale
6938739 not only the state has overlooked the environmental cost of such hydel projects but also the issues of livelihood and quality of life of those living in areas adjoining the ganga and those who will be displaced by these projects has been appallingly ignored by the state
6938740 on academic front csmmu has seen a commendable rise of 40 per cent in the number of research paper publications in past year more than 220 medical research publications in various indexed journals of repute took place which is a landmark in the country
6938741 one of my major concerns is definitely protecting the integrity of medical teaching
6938742 the initiative may add as many as three to 5 000 new direct jobs in the united states and about 10 000 to 15 000 indirect jobs in the united states as the united states is able to engage in nuclear commerce and trade with india
6938743 this agreement will deepen the strategic partnership create new opportunities for u s businesses in india enhance global energy security and reduce indias carbon emissions
6938744 diversifying indias energy sector will help it to meet its ever increasing needs and more importantly ease its reliance on hydrocarbons and unstable sources like iran this is good for the united states
6938745 u s india defence relationship derives from a common belief in freedom democracy and the rule of law and seeks to advance shared security interests
6938746 we have already seen strategic benefits from our improving relationship with india indias votes at the iaea on the iran issue last september and this past february demonstrate that new delhi is able and willing to adjust its traditional foreign policies and play a constructive role on international issues
6938747 violence is not the reply to violence the maoist problem was a product of the decades old government neglect of the basic needs of forested people the only way to overcome the insurgency is to ensure all round development in trouble torn areas
6938748 indias maoist movement is a product of poverty backwardness and neglect of the forested masses by the government any socio economic political problem should be handled with care and development this is the best way to get over the problem
6938749 but surprisingly the chhattisgarh government created the salwa judum in june 2005 which is largely handled by armed anti social elements
6938750 the government has to address peoples core issues by reaching the benefit of the public distribution scheme pds the national rural employment guarantee act nrega and a host of development schemes freed from corruption to their maoist affected peoples land and ensuring that tribals have the right over the natural resources that belong to them traditionally
6938751 under no circumstances should they be moved from their original villages into any kind of camps meeting their basic needs in camps but denying them self dignity will also not solve the problem
6938752 he sen has been victimised because he questioned the salwa judum and the false encounters of innocent tribals
6938753 police have no proof against sen they have falsely implicated him
6938754 it was not too far back when we saw how syed abdul rehman geelani was falsely implicated in the parliament attack case even given the death sentence by a pota special court but ultimately he was acquitted by the high court and the supreme court because of lack of evidence
6938755 development schemes are still not reaching the common people of bastar and the government machinery is mainly responsible
6938756 violence is not natural to human beings people resort to violence and guns only in extreme circumstances and the maoist movement too is by and large the same once the development problems of people are addressed in a sustainable way such that people feel empowered the violence will subside naturally
6938757 the contentious issue is 600 mw 4x150 loharinag pala dam being built by national thermal power corporation ntpc a central government undertaking the countrys largest power generation company ganga will be put into 26 and 17 km long tunnels leading to its disappearance from its natural course through the stretch the construction is going on in full steam the resultant destruction of the fragile and unique ecosystem will have far reaching consequences not only this all this is done in earthquake zone 5 and terrain full of sedimentary rocks no imagination is required to realize what one earthquake would to the entire region siltation is another problem ganga and all other himalayan rivers carry lots of silt along which will now settle in the reservoirs created by the dams reducing the electricity generation capacity repeated closing of nathpa jhakri dam on satluj in himachal pradesh 4 years after its commission is a fine example
6938758 in the name of development and economic growth in india rural and urban poor have been the worst hit facing displacement and dispossession at an unprecedented scale
6938759 not only the state has overlooked the environmental cost of such hydel projects but also the issues of livelihood and quality of life of those living in areas adjoining the ganga and those who will be displaced by these projects has been appallingly ignored by the state
6938760 formal experimentation on sri in india started in 2002 03 so far the method has been adapted and is being scaled up rapidly in tamil nadu andhra pradesh west bengal jharkhand chhattisgarh and gujarat this method of cultivation of rice has already helped millions of farmers to at least double their yields
6938761 with such far reaching benefits of sri why are we not actively pushing sri in up
6938762 fifty seven countries most of them in africa and asia face a severe health workforce crisis who estimates that at least 2 360 000 health service providers and 1 890 000 management support workers or a total of 4 250 000 health workers are needed to fill the gap in india too the shortage of health workers is palpable and may become acute in coming years without prompt action the shortage will worsen
6938763 in general there is a lack of adequate staff in rural areas compared to cities
6938764 there is a direct relationship between the ratio of health workers to population and survival of women during childbirth and children in early infancy as the number of health workers declines survival declines proportionately
6938765 moreover sudden catastrophic events like accidents or natural calamities like floods can quickly overwhelm local and national health systems already suffering from staff shortages or lack of funds
6938766 we need more direct investment in the training and support of health workers
6938767 dr thaksin is embarrassed about the indignity brought on all the entities the club the premier league he never intended this
6938768 he has said to me if you need me to resign from the football club as a director because it would serve the needs of the premier league then im fine with that as long as that doesnt change any other thing
6938769 he wants to be at this ground on sunday but he is hearing advice about being in a public space
6938770 i think there is a very loose term about what is fit and proper
6938771 it is almost a tongue in cheek term that you would use for premier league football over the last 10 years there are plenty of unfit and improper individuals
6938772 dr thaksin is in a political situation and a case that affects his assets so thats well documented so thats a hurdle
6938773 lastly godaddy is or was in bed with the following companies cisco dell microsoft symantec if you want to count them for antivirus solution
6938774 remember the issue with safari where it wouldnt redirect it was some sort of cisco hardware causing the issue that was put into place for anti ddos attacks
6938775 and have come to find that as a gd employee for 9 months i could be considered a
6938776 i highly agree that the qualifications of the individual dont matter when getting a new position
6938777 heather slezak is the biggest waste of space there is she has to work at godaddy because there isnt anywhere else that would take her
6938778 if you want to take godaddys side thats fine but this is not the forum to do so

6938793 implement a plan that sets a definitive course to end the practice of funding the department of public safety with gas taxes that are needed for road construction and return to funding the dps with general revenue
6938794 issuing these bonds needs to be a long term set of solutions for solving our states transportation problem
6938795 it is critical that the diversion of dedicated fuel tax dollars come to a stop
6938796 we are pleased to see agreement to fund dps from general revenue instead of gas taxes the public expects to be spent on road construction
6938797 shows how the informality and attitude that we take as characteristic of blogging can be combined with the tough mindedness research and craft that is displayed by the best investigative reporters
6938798 the most successful seo programs arent solely the result of a great seo team they happen because the entire company incorporates seo into their portion of a given project and the roi on this level of seo engagement from the entire company is through the roof
6938799 if you want creative workers give them enough time to play
6938800 i was struck by one story the book about a man who went to his fireplace and told it
6938801 the first duty of a leader is to make himself be loved without courting love to be loved without playing up to anyone even to himself
6938802 fiquei impressionado quando li sobre a lei isl mica conhecida como sharia que se baseia em normas fixas quase regimentais e chega a detalhes incr veis curiosidades para n s at mesmo regras sobre depila o remo o de sobrancelhas coito interrompido n o abandonar a mulher nos dias de menstrua o abate de animais cortando a cabe a e tantas e tantas normas que as sucessivas gera es n o flexibilizaram
6938803 im not a huge fan of trying to punish your consumer i think there are better solutions than chasing people for money im not sure what they are other than to build game experiences that make it more difficult for there to be any value in pirating games
6938804 we absolutely should crack down on piracy people put a lot of blood sweat and tears into their content and deserve to get paid for it its absolutely wrong it is stealing
6938805 para mim ser comunista n o militar num partido para mim ser comunista ter uma atitude ante a vida
6938806 a fascinating and disturbing story that frightened me nearly to death
6938807 in that pretty little house that sits back a ways from the road
6938808 i am quite sure i mean the blue house the lawn is always mowed and trimmed and theres not tons of shubbery and things around the house it just always looks pretty and well cared for
6938809 sudah istirahat saja kan di sana ada keponakan yang ngurusin biar tidak capai
6938810 rosenthal lays out a scenario where they trade howard and use some of those young players to acquire matt holliday in this scenario pat burrell could be re signed to play first base i was surprised to see that a club official sees the chances of retaining burrell as better than 50 50
6938811 if anything the yankees are in more need pitching then they are in need of another slugger
6938812 i think the whole world was shocked at how good this film was when they watched it
6938813 no theres something else different about you its like i see you now
6938814 really thats a strange thing to say what do you see
6938815 its pretty clear that hes drawing from people who might ordinarily have gone to franken
6938816 he is competing with franken for the angry voter who disapproves of bush and sees the country as off on the wrong track
6938817 we didnt need a poll to tell us al has tremendous momentum in this race and that minnesotans are responding positively to his message of change all over the state
6938818 is between al franken and norm coleman thats always been our focus
6938819 but the fact that norm coleman continues to have a wide lead among independents and is tied overall in a poll that leans so heavily democratic is very encouraging
6938820 ive only been at this a month ive done no media i just started fundraising im very happy with this i just wish franken would stop stealing all my voters
6938821 the results of this poll should be taken with a grain of salt
6938822 when i heard his comments i thought joe biden was referring to a bygone era
6938823 years ago when white folks referred to black people with education they often used words like articulate to suggest they were different they were acceptable that they were ok as compared to rest of african americans so i think it came across that joe biden was referring to sen obama as if he was a candidate running in the 1960s not in the 21st century
6938824 told the public not to pay too much attention to the mock battles on former soviet turf those robots and tanks were really meant to kick butt in small wars they insisted
6938825 weve spent so many resources and so much attention on iraq that weve lost sight of future threats down the road the current conflict between russia and georgia is a perfect example
6938826 what does god require of you but to do justly love mercy and to walk humbly with your god
6938827 we will be tested tomorrow yep we will be tested
6938828 there is a small stone inside the right kidney but we wont worry about that right now because theres also a mass in the kidney it may be a cyst or it may be something else

6938832 you have a vivid imagination and this is good great inventors explorers all had inventive imaginative minds your friends and acquaintances may consider you over imaginative and given to fantasy or day dreaming so what this is a part of your character and charm

6938837 wow its been nearly a year since my last post
6938838 we need to know exactly how much our cargo weighs
6938839 it says that youre transporting a dragon theres no such thing
6938840 i see youre reading an apocalypse novel about the tribulation it has devils and demons in it you believe in devils or demons
6938841 if you suddenly found yourself looking at a demon would you be surprised
6938842 would you be surprised if you found yourself looking at a dragon
6938843 dragons dont exist demons do i go to church i read i listen i believe
6938844 if the world suddenly came to an end you wouldnt be surprised
6938845 so if youre seeking more than one dragon you wont find it here
6938846 i see you found the trail and the chapel too i suppose
6938847 you are impressive young gawaine you might be the most formidable soldier at arms ive ever beheld i have the oddest feeling that if you chose to cross that hellish valley behind us alone youd make a good account of yourself and might even win the other side
6938848 im going to buy things for the larder see you all shortly
6938849 theres a one hundred and fifty acre estate on the other side of the door

6938855 im lightning bolt i am not flash gordon or anybody my name is bolt lightning bolt
6938856 their feeling now is you made gains and you should keep them
6938857 after what happened their successes they are not really feeling constrained now
6938858 coming into the first game of the season you are always a little concerned we knew that loyola had a good team with a lot of returning players and having played here in the ncaa tournament last year that they wouldnt be intimidated by the environment we controlled the game early but it took us a while to get the first goal the second one with 16 seconds left in the half was big because it gave us a little bit of a cushion
6938859 it would have been nice to get the third goal and little bit earlier
6938860 that way we could have gotten some players some more minutes and gotten a few more into the game we know get another week of practice before our next game to continue to improve and experiment with our lineup and roles
6938861 the flow is increasing as dramatically as it is because it is operating in a condition of impunity
6938862 the failure of the venezuelan government to go after this is a failure to be serious
6938863 frankly this has gotten to the point where theyre playing games
6938864 usually drugs is beyond a lot of other political differences we have a cooperative relationship with cuba
6938865 there just has been no willingness to establish that cooperation or re establish a working relationship
6938866 youve got to go after the criminals and youve got to go after those who are in positions of authority and are criminals
6938867 just do it its in your interest to do it

6938870 we do not doubt that criminal elements may be involved in seeking to subvert or corrupt some players or players support staff that may even involve organized criminal gangs but to elevate that suspicion to a claim of mafia involvement is in our view a distortion of the facts and is positively damaging to the sport
6938871 any player caught cheating should be punished by a lengthy suspension for a first offence and if the circumstances merit it a life ban
6938872 about the fifth day i thought about it and i saw a lot of similarities so i was a little bit concerned
6938873 the first time we went through spinal taps mris blood tests it took about a week to diagnose her and with him he immediately was admitted
6938874 parents tend to sense that theres just something different about this disease
6938875 i think that the number is slowly increasing because of our educational efforts in the community to increase the awareness of the disease both among the public as well as among physicians
6938876 its been extremely safe and weve had no complications in terms of reaction to the infusions or any other time of complication
6938877 im not a lazy bum im a sign of the times

6938881 agencies incur a significant legal risk if they continue to call unauthorized cell phones
6938882 but removing cell phone numbers from all dialing pools creates a likely drop in productivity and collections without this solution from ontario systems collection agencies are in a very difficult position
6938883 this product is far superior to any other solution for this potentially damaging ruling
6938884 it allows our clients to remain 100 percent in compliance while still maintaining their productivity levels

6938886 that by impairing one from of memory long term memory it is actually possible to improve another form
6938887 its one of the anecdotal things thats hard to question
6938888 nobel prize winning economist robert mundell has written that if such tax increases are adopted the u
6938889 to date few economists see supply side economics as a respectable school of thought with alan blinder calling it an
6938890 the idea that tax cuts would actually increase revenues turned out to deserve the ridicule
6938891 do unto others as you would have done unto you
6938892 as we stand here i still absolutely believe that my client is innocent
6938893 davidson questioned why the children didnt remember details about the club and why they werent examined by medical personnel trained to detect sexual abuse
6938894 so you got these incredible suggestive tainted interviews and who takes over the interviews the woman who has custody of the three children
6938895 the prosecutor countered the characterization murphy asked kellys stepdaughter about allegations by child advocates that kelly beat her and his wife he also told jurors kelly didnt contest previous abuse allegations by child welfare officials involving another child who is not part of the case those cases did not result in charges kelly was also charged with aggravated sexual assault of a child and tampering with physical evidence but he was not tried on those charges
6938896 two others who allegedly took part in the ring jamie pittman and shauntel mayo were earlier convicted in minutes and sentenced to life in prison three other defendants in the case are awaiting trial
6938897 the prosecutor countered the characterization murphy asked kellys stepdaughter about allegations by child advocates that kelly beat her and his wife he also told jurors kelly didnt contest previous abuse allegations by child welfare officials involving another child who is not part of the case those cases did not result in charges
6938898 kelly was also charged with aggravated sexual assault of a child and tampering with physical evidence but he was not tried on those charges
6938899 the pullback of russian troops and units passed without incident and was completed on time
6938900 russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
6938901 if needed we reserve the right to boost these forces
6938902 i do not believe that these actions can seriously contribute to the stabilization of the situation in the region
6938903 i announce to you the good news of the martyrdom of my friend sheikh abu khabab al masri and his pious comrades

6938916 if followed such advice could lead to life threatening consequences within 24 36 hours for some thousands of australians who depend on glucocorticoid replacement
6938917 its my feeling that this submission may have been suppressed or nobbled to avoid a few red faces in canberra and to preserve the impression that all is well with australian pharmaceutical product and consumer medicine information
6938918 for those who depend on adrenal replacement for their survival it is simply dangerous nonsense for the advice do not take cortate if you have an uncontrolled infection to remain on the books
6938919 external review did not support all the interpretations made in the correspondence
6938920 breached fundamental rules on the potential conflict of interest of reviewers
6938921 the decision not to publish in this case was made by the editorial executive committee and a full explanation was given to the authors
6938922 a lot of guessing goes into the decision and there should be more objective information
6938923 giving full information to people would mean that they can actually know whats going on and rather than judging individual schools or school systems on the basis of myths rumour prejudice or perception people would have the facts
6938924 im not sure that is the case at the moment perhaps as worrying as that statement is from the point of view of being the federal education minister i couldnt tell because the amount of information thats available doesnt enable me to make that judgment in a meaningful way
6938925 so i think the more information thats available to parents the better
6938926 people will still make choices for a wide variety of reasons
6938927 there should be very strong national standards and national assessments so we can say what it actually means to graduate from a high school rather than letting each state set its own benchmark
6938928 australian children are going to have to compete with kids all over the world so the opportunity to set really strong standards and make the information about them transparent to parents to educators to everybody seems to me to be a very intelligent central government function
6938929 put it this way if she ms gillard were to make everything transparent showing progress tying it to meaningful national assessments but without putting a letter grade on schools she would have accomplished a great deal
6938930 i think the power of letter grades is that they focus the mind but data and information will also focus the mind and you never want the best to be the enemy of the good
6938931 peer grouping methodologies are very important to enable genuine comparisons of like with like
6938932 we know that kids across the nation go to schools with a set of abilities and challenges and we know that schools that cater for disadvantaged communities tend to be working with more students who need extra assistance
6938933 whats got a negative reaction from many around the place is the sense that was pushed very strongly by the howard government that all of this was going to be about raw scores
6938934 school leaders and schoolteachers i think would respond well to feeling there is going to be an objective measurement and understanding of the nature of the particular task they face
6938935 were looking at a model about supplementing resources to make a difference for disadvantaged schools rather than a rewards based model
6938936 one would be in a better position to work out which schools need extra assistance a better position to then measure the difference that the extra assistance and implemented programs make that evaluation would enable us to identify and spread best practice
6938937 i do think transparency of information in and of itself will spur people to do better and they will all want to be seen to be doing better
6938938 they should probably be introducing a tax for energy waste if you want to knock a building down if you want to waste that energy then you have to make a payment for it
6938939 raising taxes is not an option to swamp vermonters with more taxes when they are getting crushed with higher fuel costs is too much for the average vermonter especially when we are still one of the higher taxed states in the nation
6938940 i think i have a much higher iq than you do
6938941 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
6938942 i think he can be ready but right now i dont think he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
6938943 i had a vegan biscuit once and it was revolting
6938944 what is that i know theres chocolate but theres a secret ingredient

6938991 when the local defence volunteers the fore runner of the home guard were formed in great britain their formation was not extended to northern ireland in response the inspector general of the royal ulster constabulary offered the northern ireland prime minister the services of the ulster special constabulary to fill the gap and fulfil the role under taken by the ldvs in great britain this resulted in the formation of the local defence volunteers section yes thank you again but its not particularly helpful as its not dated sign in before you can post messages join this group please update your nickname on the yourplace com gt wrote gt gt gt on the other hand and bringing it right back the only only part of the gt gt gt uk gt gt gt where no home guard or ldf was in northern ireland for fear on the part gt gt gt of gt gt gt the local government that arming catholics would not be a desirable gt gt gt outcome gt gt hmm the queens university student rag mag is called ptq one gt gt of the wartime covers showed a pair of armed and uniformed home gt gt guards marching smartly past a couple of scruffy specials with sticks gt gt and a bad case of weapons envy gt gt so i am fairly sure the home guard existed here too gt well eventually they were formally named that but it was largely a gt cosmetic exercise gt in britain the hg were a military organisation under the territorial army gt in northern ireland local defence consisted entirely of b specials a gt police force and in its original guise of the ulster defence volunteers was gt nothing more than a branch of that force to whit the local defence gt volunteers section gt this was then passed unchanged to the control of the ruc and when this gt section was actually renamed as the ulster home guard it was still manned gt by the same cadre of b specials and still a police force gt finally they did come under the direct command of the british army but they gt and their b special parent organisation were used interchangeably in the gt local defence role gt in short a very different organisation to the british home guard and with gt no affiliations with that organisation whatsoever just for the record they the b specials were seen by the british police as an affiliated

6939006 its difficult to expect more out of love and marriage when everyone around you tells you theres nothing more to find
6939007 the younger generation which would be us theyre talking about isnt blind they notice the lack of sparkle in a married couples eyes they observe the fighting they hear the harsh demeaning words they take note of the lack of beauty tenderness and romance they see the divorce papers
6939008 very few have ever seen even one marriage that would cause them to say when i get married i wamt my marriage to be exactly like that
6939009 todays sex at thirteen generation typically feels that its a waste of time to invest in their future love story because the idea of lasting love seems distant and fa fetched all that matters is making it through today they dont wait around for long term relationships they live in a world of temporary flings and one night stands it is no longer enough to tell young people they should wait for something better they first need to believe that something better really exists

6939011 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6939012 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
6939013 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6939014 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6939015 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6939016 im sure hell make a wonderful choice for our party and for our country and well just have to wait until next friday to find out the answer to those questions
6939017 the world situation and recent events show that we are at the point of breakdown of the world system and the threat of a thermonuclear world war iii is immediate
6939018 this is the british empire against the united states and one of the most dangerous features of the present crisis is that the united states the bush administration is acting like damned fools

6939029 four countries have now decided against coming to pakistan i probably shouldnt bracket the other three england australia and new zealand with south africa as they have yet to announce their decisions but from what we are hearing they will probably do the same
6939030 we know of cricket south africas decision and we will not be making any further comment until the board has discussed champions trophy related issues on sunday
6939031 at some stage there was child trafficking involved prior to them coming into contact with the agency involved in india
6939032 will work very closely with federal and state agencies to investigate these claims
6939033 the flow is increasing as dramatically as it is because it is operating in a condition of impunity
6939034 the failure of the venezuelan government to go after this is a failure to be serious
6939035 frankly this has gotten to the point where theyre playing games
6939036 usually drugs is beyond a lot of other political differences we have a cooperative relationship with
6939037 there just has been no willingness to establish that cooperation or re establish a working relationship
6939038 youve got to go after the criminals and youve got to go after those who are in positions of authority and are criminals
6939039 just do it its in your interest to do it
6939040 withdraw the us troops from iraq by end of 2011
6939041 the combat troops will withdraw from iraqi cities by june 2009 both the parties have agreed on this
6939042 the negotiators job is done now it is up to the leaders
6939043 the balance were trying to reach is between iraqs stated desire to have a more concrete view of us forces levels out through the years and our desire it be based on conditions on the ground
6939044 i am glad the administration has finally shifted to accepting a timetable for the removal of our combat troops from iraq
6939045 there is a provision that says the withdrawal could be done even before 2011 or extended beyond 2011 depending on the security situation
6939046 getting the word out via twitter has been the most successful means
6939047 why is this working probably because beth suggested a concrete dollar amount instead of just asking us to donate
6939048 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6939049 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6939050 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6939051 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6939052 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche

6939054 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6939055 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania

6939070 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6939071 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6939072 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6939073 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6939074 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6939075 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6939076 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
6939077 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
6939078 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
6939079 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
6939080 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6939081 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6939082 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6939083 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6939084 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6939085 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6939086 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6939087 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
6939088 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6939089 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6939090 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6939091 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6939092 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
6939093 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
6939094 protocolo espec fico adicional sobre recursos h dricos compartidos entre la rep blica de chile y la rep blica argentina
6939095 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica
6939096 una grave falta tica si estos productos son reorientados a otros mercados donde no hay controles respecto a estas extremadamente peligrosas sustancias t xicas
6939097 producci n y uso de sustancias qu micas y bienes de consumo
6939098 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6939099 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6939100 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6939101 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6939102 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6939103 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6939104 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
6939105 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6939106 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6939107 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6939108 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6939109 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6939110 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6939111 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6939112 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6939113 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
6939114 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
6939115 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales
6939116 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6939117 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6939118 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6939119 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
6939120 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6939121 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6939122 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6939123 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6939124 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6939125 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6939126 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6939127 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6939128 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6939129 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6939130 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6939131 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6939132 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6939133 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6939134 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6939135 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6939136 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6939137 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6939138 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6939139 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6939140 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6939141 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6939142 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6939143 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6939144 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6939145 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6939146 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6939147 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6939148 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6939149 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
6939150 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6939151 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6939152 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6939153 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6939154 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6939155 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6939156 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6939157 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one severe and or moderate life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women
6939158 the researchers also didnt account for other factors known to affect breast cancer risk such as family history or weight breast cancer is a complex disease and there is unlikely to be one single cause
6939159 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6939160 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6939161 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6939162 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6939163 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6939164 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6939165 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6939166 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6939167 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6939168 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6939169 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6939170 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6939171 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6939172 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6939173 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6939174 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6939175 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6939176 the results of the present evaluation indicate that ms beaver made a concerted effort to present herself as more impaired than she actually is
6939177 the results of psychological testing suggest that she feigned symptoms of psychosis and exaggerated any cognitive deficits she may have
6939178 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6939179 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6939180 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6939181 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6939182 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6939183 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6939184 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6939185 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6939186 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6939187 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6939188 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6939189 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6939190 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6939191 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6939192 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6939193 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6939194 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6939195 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6939196 in the spring of 2009 we plan to have two international events outside of the united kingdom
6939197 were looking at italy sweden australia and the philippines we want to go to germany in 2009 but we havent launched television
6939198 we look at places where wwe has had five years of success after three to five years of following wwe many fans are ready to graduate to the ufc
6939199 all men are frauds the only difference between them is that some admit it i myself deny it
6939200 hanya orang orang yang berkepentingan saja yang bisa hadir di sini
6939201 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6939202 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6939203 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6939204 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6939205 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6939206 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6939207 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6939208 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6939209 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6939210 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6939211 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6939212 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6939213 dr thaksin is embarrassed about the indignity brought on all the entities the club the premier league he never intended this
6939214 he has said to me if you need me to resign from the football club as a director because it would serve the needs of the premier league then im fine with that as long as that doesnt change any other thing
6939215 he wants to be at this ground on sunday but he is hearing advice about being in a public space
6939216 i think there is a very loose term about what is fit and proper
6939217 it is almost a tongue in cheek term that you would use for premier league football over the last 10 years there are plenty of unfit and improper individuals
6939218 dr thaksin is in a political situation and a case that affects his assets so thats well documented so thats a hurdle
6939219 in ontario there are three confirmed deaths at this point linked to the investigation and another is still under investigation
6939220 there are some additional cases of listeria currently under investigation in quebec
6939221 we have one confirmed case of listeria thats associated with the provincial outbreak and that case is deceased
6939222 we have confirmed that the primary cause of death is listeriosis
6939223 what well find out is whether the illness and the meat were linked if its the same strain
6939224 weve put in place a new system that allows us to detect an outbreak and to see a pattern very early in the game
6939225 im glad we got hold of it early and now well take serious steps working with the feds to put it behind us
6939226 we then notified the canadian food inspection agency on aug 6 to tell them we had these positive food samples and the cfia then worked with us to collect further samples from the nursing home
6939227 it was based on the results of those early tests and as well based on communication that maple leaf foods put out to its distributors that we on august 14 asked the long term care facilities to put certain products on hold
6939228 well the protocol says up to 24 hours it can take the average is eight we did this one in five
6939229 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6939230 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6939231 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6939232 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6939233 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6939234 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6939235 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6939236 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6939237 we found out that wall street has been kind of a nudist beach
6939238 theyre looking for help obviously and the scale of help is such that i dont think it can come from the private sector
6939239 what well see is failures where the bankers were dumb in what they did
6939240 in retrospect i was wrong to partially sell the holdings
6939241 i should actually thank the government for helping me get my eye for an eye by showing you the evidence that youve seen the videos
6939242 helping me to take away your heart and your innocence
6939243 thats what they have done and i should thank them but i wont
6939244 my murdered molested son should have had the same rights as a living victim
6939245 ive had too much focus on keeping my family together and protecting my daughter fighting cancer for the last few years but now that this appears to be close to over im going to work on changing that
6939246 tropical storm fay has produced excessive rainfall because it has always been near or over very warm water the state of florida is too skinny east to west to have ever cut the moisture off from fay completely
6939247 the center of fay is expected to continue crossing the northern florida peninsula tonight and then move near or over the florida panhandle on saturday
6939248 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage
6939249 i hope the wheaties box and all those types of things happen

6939299 le pareci como si hubiese estado tendido en el suelo se levant lentamente era una cosa enorme y gris mayor que un hombre con unos terribles ojos resplandecientes y rojos
6939300 es verdad era horrible con una fea cara como la de un b ho con orejas muy grandes y ojos tambi n muy grandes y rojos iba cubierto de plumas grises las garras eran negras se elev repentinamente y desapareci entre las copas de los rboles

6939302 our mexican coaches do very well and are competing cheek and jowl with their counterparts in other countries in terms of total revenue growth
6939303 our business coaches are the cream of the crop and are leaders in their own right
6939304 after all they represent the worlds leader in business coaching
6939305 i didnt like the number crunching but enjoyed interpreting the outcomes and making decisions based on the figures
6939306 i wanted to see if i could run my own business instead of being an employee
6939307 the accounting background is an excellent basis for being a business coach as you have a detailed understanding of what can be an effective business this only applies to management accountants in industry as i dont believe a lot of tax or private practice accountants have enough practical knowledge of industry
6939308 i had to change my mind set to lead people and become a mentor rather than someone involved in producing reports
6939309 as a business coach my aim is to produce results not reports
6939310 becoming an actioncoach has moved me out of my comfort zone and has introduced me to many new concepts opening my mind to the impact of vision and goals
6939311 i have been able to gain enormous knowledge through actioncoachs world class training books and other tools
6939312 i have had to develop presentation skills as well as communication marketing leadership and people skills to become more effective and powerful in my new role as an actioncoach
6939313 i want to be the most respected business coach in australia based on not the number of clients i have but on the best results and quality of advice i give my clients
6939314 as a business coach you can make an impact on the people and business performance whilst most accountants simply report the past and dont impact the future
6939315 this can happen in instances where your clients dont understand their figures in the business so you are able to give them good practical advice in financial terms which further builds your credibility
6939316 as an ex accountant i can make a decision immediately instead of needing to wait and get their accountant involved however i never give in depth financial advice instead i teach them general principles which in most cases is enough for them
6939317 most people need their tax done even government policy dictates that you must use an accountant sadly coaching is not seen in the same light
6939318 today business owners cannot go it alone there is a need for a third a in addition to an attorney and an accountant having an actioncoach is no longer the luxury it used to be it has become a necessity for businesses all over the world to employ this type of service
6939319 our growth has been significant and this industry has also grown by leaps and bounds today business coaching is the second fastest growing industry
6939320 there is a huge need for business coaching and we are filling this gap on a global basis
6939321 in this manner business owners are not bogged down by the day to day operations of their business and can concentrate on growing their businesses and achieving true freedom and balance
6939322 we dont want to save your life we just want you to like your shirt
6939323 as an accountant that human aspect gets lost in numbers as a business coach it is at the very forefront
6939324 i absolutely enjoy working with other business owners helping them reach their full potential
6939325 an accountants role is limited whereas for a business coach the sky is the limit
6939326 i had to develop selling skills an area that most accountants do not work on
6939327 i feel much more confident about my own business as well
6939328 i can get results for my clients and the feeling of achievement is truly uplifting
6939329 actioncoach business coaches are becoming a force to reckon with in the big world of small business
6939330 in todays tough economic times it is becoming increasingly important to have a business coach business coaches can provide a holistic view of all business matters and equip business owners with the tools to succeed
6939331 just as a business owner needs the services of an attorney and accountant he also needs the services of a third a an actioncoach
6939332 we have a network of more than 1000 coaches who pool in resources expertise and knowledge on an ongoing basis this is where our strength lies and this is what makes us the leader in business coaching
6939333 actioncoach business coaches are an important part of small business today they are leading the way to a better business around the world
6939334 actioncoach is truly global and our strong network of business coaches around the world shares a wealth of resources and expertise making us true leaders in the second fastest growing industry in the world
6939335 i had left law about five years before becoming an actioncoach to pursue entrepreneurship for me while the law firm i was at was a great well established and highly ethical firm the practice of law was ultimately unfulfilling
6939336 actioncoach business coaches and attorneys both provide professional services in the form of advice clients may not want to even hear for a fee
6939337 there is also a need for continuing education as well as developing interpersonal and relationship building skills in both these professions
6939338 lawyers can only help businesses in a limited way by illuminating legal risks which flow from particular business decisions coaching is about getting into the business nuts and bolts
6939339 while there are some lawyers who provide advice on non legal business issues it is inappropriate to do so since they are not trained in this area they are trained to be risk averse which is not consistent with entrepreneurial decision making
6939340 as a coach you are looked upon as part of the team as a lawyer you are perceived as a necessary evil also lawyers are less interested in the personal side of things and want to focus on the issues coaches spend a lot of time developing not only businesses but also people
6939341 lawyers have to do the work coaches instruct and motivate the clients to do the work unlike lawyers they are not bogged down by strenuous paperwork
6939342 as an actioncoach i am able to do the things i cannot as a lawyer which includes but is not limited to achieving 300 400 business growth increasing margins by 25 implementing recruiting practices that improve the quality of hiring while reducing the cost of doing so helping clients to grow as leaders
6939343 they say law schools are full of smart people who cant think of anything better to do for me it wasnt quite that i had many interests ranging from politics to international relations to entrepreneurship and believed law school would be a potential learning platform
6939344 however being able to look at the bigger picture is more important than anything else
6939345 at actioncoach we want to be able to empower our clients so they can spend less time working in their business and more time working on their business

6939361 security threats both online and offline have increased dramatically over the last few years and with 16 year olds hacking into network servers and mainframes we believe we cannot afford to ignore potential security risks even when we already have advanced security systems in place

6939374 other companies may try to lure you in with offers such as a free tv that you may or may not ever even see but we rely on no such gimmicks and instead turn to true value and quality
6939375 the main reason behind us using nvolve for outsourcing our projects is the higher level of quality local project management and the lower pricing strategy they use in comparison to local service providers their project manager adds value and talent to our business while all the time keeping our cost down below the tender threshold allowing us to move quickly in ramping up projects

6939413 californias budget crisis underscores the states critical need for a long term modernization and global competitiveness strategy before it is too late
6939414 needed improvement in state tax revenues depends on a vibrant growing economy and jobs base the impacts and inefficiencies of our infrastructure backlog threaten not only the states economic vitality and our quality of life but the jobs of state employees if declining state revenues and the resulting financial inability to service the debt on state obligation bonds for new infrastructure continue
6939415 bond measures that cant be funded due to the states growing fiscal imbalance will likely alienate future voter support
6939416 the mounting backlog of projects including desperately needed state highway and goods movement efforts already overwhelms the capacity of a number of state agencies to deliver needed design and construction services if and when the funds become available public private partnerships or as the governor likes to call it performance based infrastructure does not require that projects use only private sector employees in many cases where these private public mechanisms have been successfully used it is public employees who often lead or supply much of the design and construction management services depending on the nature of the project and the allocation of financial risks
6939417 operations research offers a powerful set of tools that have been used successfully in everything from world war ii to wal mart style logistics planning these tools ought to be used to increase the success of existing programs and to help expand access to hiv care and treatment in resource limited countries
6939418 for example operations research could help with the planning of a national drug distribution system or with predicting the demand for services at local clinics and the best ways to staff them
6939419 to date hiv treatment scale up has appropriately focused first on policy level issues such as program initiation and costs and secondarily on operational level issues
6939420 now that many programs are in place the potential gains from improved planning are great especially given the high cost of antiretroviral drug therapy
6939421 the analysis suggested that implementation of such a program could allow the government of rwanda to scale up hiv treatment without overburdening its existing health care system
6939422 the unique advantage of operations research is that it gives us the ability to evaluate and optimize outcomes of various scenarios such as determining the best approach for the management of lab equipment repair without impacting patients
6939423 once we have the evidence for a new approach a good case can be made that it should be implemented as policy although any initiative should take into account the environments in which the projects are to be carried out with all necessary ethical cultural and political considerations
6939424 placing greater emphasis on long term strategic planning and increasing the attention and resources directed to capacity building for sustainability
6939425 while laudable progress has been made the great majority of hiv patients are still under treated or untreated
6939426 we feel that operations research provides one of the tools to make sure progress continues
6939427 this area of research and specifically this and other projects led by drs hupert and xiong shows how fields such as the engineering sciences can contribute to solving medical and public health problems
6939428 an increasing number of our mobile operator clients are concerned with the security of their networks as the problem of mobile malware and spam grows worse

6939433 we have only just begun to tap the potential of these microorganisms our undergraduates have given us a peek at the treasure these habitats hold and we need to move quickly to preserve them
6939434 clearly the inner tissues of plants are a biological niche for microbial life that warrants further exploration
6939435 it is a niche that can be readily explored by undergraduate students the potential to explore something so completely unknown gets the students very excited about science
6939436 we found that there are a variety of behaviors learning disabilities and emotional problems that are unique to patients with xxyy syndrome that may be better addressed with more targeted therapies
6939437 our research is important because it provides an accurate picture of what patients are experiencing that can help physicians who treat patients with the disorder
6939438 until now physicians have had to search the medical literature to patch together a treatment plan mostly based on information on klinefelter syndrome
6939439 as a result people with xxyy werent being screened for the specific medical problems associated with their disorder they werent receiving therapies or medications for the behavioral and neurodevelopmental issues that are more profound for them and they werent receiving the types of community services that can help them live independent lives our research is an important resource for families and practitioners
6939440 life skills are more of a struggle for these males and they may need different medications a broader array of behavioral therapies and more intensive community support than those with klinefelter syndrome
6939441 we were tired of having our families running around the country looking for answers from people who didnt have them
6939442 the more we talked the more we realized our boys had things in common that were not addressed in the literature
6939443 kyle knows that people dont understand xxyy and therefore dont understand him as a person she said
6939444 the study helps the world know why he is like he is it validates what he knows about himself and what we know about him when he cant follow directions its not because hes stupid

6939457 the greens are tough and when hunter goes out and shoots that nine under round yesterday it shows you that it is capable and it is out there
6939458 no question especially thursday morning to friday afternoon its a different golf course the greens are definitely bouncy and firmer and definitely played tougher

6939463 im not a huge fan of trying to punish your consumer i think there are better solutions than chasing people for money im not sure what they are other than to build game experiences that make it more difficult for there to be any value in pirating games
6939464 we absolutely should crack down on piracy people put a lot of blood sweat and tears into their content and deserve to get paid for it its absolutely wrong it is stealing
6939465 if they scatter go for the baby and the mother
6939466 of all the creatures in the vastness of the universe there is none like me
6939467 obviously it got out of control but to be honest i thought i was in a safe house
6939468 i thought i was part of a community that handled its problems internally and that recognized the dangers of exposing ourselves no pun intended to the rest of the country
6939469 theres nothing like that sort of industrial sized company thats still doing everything in house
6939470 i could do it with a phone call but it dilutes the brand the image of the company the product
6939471 beyond that we need the work here why ship it off someplace else
6939472 studies that weve done suggest that our market is about eight times what were producing right now so were way behind the eight ball
6939473 i think i am much better positioned to win kentucky mo arkansas west virginia than any of the other candidates running because of my positions on the issues because i come from a state that is a border state that the politics of having to reach across party lines matter because my 34 years in the senate have been the opposite of polarizing they have been uniting so i think for all those reasons i think i have the best chance of crossing over and picking up independent votes and keeping a democratic base but again time will tell that thats an assertion its a judgment that democrats are going to make but they will make that judgment of who they think well be best able to win a general election
6939474 you know hes a very smart guy i cant speak for me but i know for me that it was a learning experience i worked very hard im sure hes working very hard too ive watched seven presidents and ive watched presidents who have come to office who havent thought through some of the areas that theytve never worked in for example foreign policy i watched several presidents come in and theyre smart as the devil and they get here and unless you already know when you get here exactly what your foreign policy is its awful hard to hit the ground running and not to make serious mistakes the first couple of years im not saying that senator obama is where i was when elected to the senate at age 29 i was younger than he was when he got to the senate but i do think i acknowledge that experience is not the issue its whether your experience has been good or bad somebody with 34 years of bad experience isnt perfectly qualified to be president someone with 34 years of good experience that makes a big difference so again i know its kindof difficult to master its kindof difficult to feel sure footed in a lot of areas that you havent spent a long of time dealing with
6939475 its a little bit like my friend dennis kucinich dennis god love him gets up in all these debates and says the democratic congress could end the war today dennis should read the constitution you gotta have 67 votes to override a presidential veto unless hes figured out how to get 17 republicans in the senate to vote with us im not quite sure how to do that but its very appealing
6939476 the third thing thats different since his 1988 presidential run are the obscene amounts of money that are being it is radically different the last time i changed this at the stage i left which was eight months before iowa i had raised 6 million and that was more than any other candidate had raised in the democratic process now youre talking about these giant amounts of money that its arguable that you need 100 million to run in a primary its obscene i think theres going to be a backlash to it

6939480 withdraw the us troops from iraq by end of 2011
6939481 the combat troops will withdraw from iraqi cities by june 2009 both the parties have agreed on this
6939482 the negotiators job is done now it is up to the leaders
6939483 the balance were trying to reach is between iraqs stated desire to have a more concrete view of us forces levels out through the years and our desire it be based on conditions on the ground
6939484 i am glad the administration has finally shifted to accepting a timetable for the removal of our combat troops from iraq
6939485 there is a provision that says the withdrawal could be done even before 2011 or extended beyond 2011 depending on the security situation

6939520 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6939521 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6939522 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6939523 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6939524 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6939525 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6939526 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6939527 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6939528 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6939529 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6939530 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6939531 salt of the earth and several funky gospel tracks chess pressing 10
6939532 tv music for jazz band that nutty grind the spiritual battle of rufus b hayes and the title track
6939533 chicago modern soul lp from the early 80s recorded for jerry butlers fountain label
6939534 i wanna do something freaky to you vg damage to the front amp back cover vg 8
6939535 the uncle tom game it aint no fun being a welfare recipient
6939536 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6939537 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6939538 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6939539 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6939540 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6939541 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6939542 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6939543 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6939544 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6939545 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6939546 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6939547 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6939548 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6939549 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6939550 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6939551 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6939552 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6939553 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6939554 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6939555 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6939556 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6939557 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6939558 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6939559 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6939560 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6939561 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6939562 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6939563 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6939564 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6939565 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6939566 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6939567 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6939568 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6939569 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6939570 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6939571 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6939572 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6939573 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6939574 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6939575 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6939576 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6939577 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6939578 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6939579 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6939580 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6939581 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6939582 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6939583 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6939584 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6939585 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6939586 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6939587 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6939588 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6939589 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6939590 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6939591 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6939592 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6939593 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6939594 this is a planning took where all things are going
6939595 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6939596 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6939597 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6939598 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6939599 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6939600 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6939601 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6939602 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6939603 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6939604 dont let it eat me dont let it eat me
6939605 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6939606 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6939607 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6939608 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6939609 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6939610 people sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf
6939611 to his credit he actually didnt do half bad im sure mccain would be pretty happy if bob barr dropped out to pursue his new love of stand up
6939612 plans to spend much of the labor day weekend campaigning in michigan the state party announced the trip friday mckinney has detroit area events planned for august 30 through sept 1
6939613 jack kevorkians strategy for getting elected to congress may be unique in american politics
6939614 political philosophy on the ninth amendment of the constitution which basically says that just because certain rights are specifically listed in the constitution doesnt mean the people dont have other rights for kevorkian that means just about everything
6939615 its unfair to not allow the city to assess what that loss of quality of life was
6939616 someone tapped me on the shoulder and said are we going to make that turn
6939617 i said h e l l and before i could say no the boat hit the pier
6939618 i never walked off the boat im still on the boat every time i wake up its oct 15
6939619 its very cynical even more so when you understand that in many african american demographics gun homicides are the number one cause of death
6939620 to have these people use the history of discrimination against african americans going back 140 years to say this is why we need to have guns in churches restaurants and schools where is this going to end
6939621 something i dont have cant possible burn in a place that doesnt exist for a nonsensical period of time
6939622 how can you comprehend at 12 or 13 that youre going to be discarded
6939623 it was going so well then when it stopped i didnt know what i had done wrong
6939624 i was always so nice to people i never turned my back on people
6939625 but i didnt think there was anything i could do i was scared to say i didnt want to wear something to be that girl who had an attitude or didnt cooperate i liked having my mom there so she could say it
6939626 that started in new york calling her obese at a size 4
6939627 i thought i needed to diet i was doing all this to make my mom proud to make money and all of a sudden it stopped i would just eat salad i didnt want to go to the beach because of my stretch marks
6939628 dont ask questions criticize me say things that are hypocritical and look at me as if you are totally satisfied with the way you look im human youre human
6939629 at school at lunchtime im in the bathroom holding girls hair while they throw up my friends dad took her for a consultation with a plastic surgeon to get rid of her love handles
6939630 i had a model friend who was too small pants were always way too big for her
6939631 there is seventeen and teen vogue those are fun they have teachers on set
6939632 its still fun for me but if i ever do another runway show im going to be walking for the empowerment of women not just walking on a stage
6939633 the leaders we have while theyre the worst that weve had are hardly the worst this poor world has seen
6939634 the joke is of course you tell what the joke is and it kills the joke that the guy has to range very far afield to find anyone worse
6939635 you just listen to the song and it feels like it was written for that occasion
6939636 i picked a funny medium to do what i do
6939637 theres not much humor and theres very little being someone else
6939638 this is the first generation of singer songwriter types to reach this age and i wanted to see if i could write from there rather than say im going to boogie all night
6939639 hes as empathetic and acerbic as ever but maybe more focused and forthright not speaking through characters so much
6939640 there are things i wouldnt have said and the diction is different i dont speak like that
6939641 looking a bit like the garbage compacting hero of the blockbuster animation wall e gordon has a brain composed of 50 000 to 100 000 active neurons
6939642 both parties try to control every minute of the convention as if it were a television show because it is a television show

6939645 how could you rent me a place here knowing that a drug kingpin is just a few doors down
6939646 um is there anything else i can help you with today
6939647 obviously it got out of control but to be honest i thought i was in a safe house
6939648 i thought i was part of a community that handled its problems internally and that recognized the dangers of exposing ourselves no pun intended to the rest of the country
6939649 everybody was looking forward to this argentina game because of losing to them in 04 all of their guys play with their hearts thats why we could never really break away like we wanted to but we did enough to get the job done
6939650 i think the key is the same that we did last time really put pressure on their guards
6939651 obviously pao gasol is going to be tough inside but i thought our bigs did a great job last time
6939652 ranks up there because one youre representing your country and i think the reason why it really ranks up there is the fact that we lost in 04 and this is the type of situation where were trying to bounce back
6939653 maybe he stepped on someones foot but it wasnt jumping
6939654 the usa team combines technical ability physicality and discipline which they didnt show in previous tournaments
6939655 we put them on the line in the second quarter at the 8 10 mark
6939656 any time a team can go to the line and continue to make free throws it allows their defense to set up it takes away from our strength which is running
6939657 we got some good looks we didnt knock them down and then we fouled and put them on the free throw line
6939658 i think you saw that by how we came out of the gate and i think when ginobili got hurt we kind of let up a little bit they made some shots went into a zone and we didnt penetrate or do anything to get in the gaps
6939659 everybody was looking forward to this argentina game because of losing to them in 04 all of their guys play with their hearts thats why we could never really break away like we wanted to but we did enough to get the job done

6939669 the hipster represents a culture so detached and disconnected that it has stopped giving birth to anything new
6939670 this is a bitter sweet loss for a lot of our players
6939671 on one hand we feel good because of the closer result than in years past against
6939672 i thought picarelli did an outstanding job for us this evening
6939673 the overwhelming participation of kashmiris in the programmes has made it clear that they are neither prepared to relinquish their demands to ready to make any compromise on them
6939674 the mass movement will be carried forward with unity and the youth in particular are requested to maintain peace during processions and rallies
6939675 our just and genuine struggle for right of self determination and freedom has entered a decisive and critical phase after decades of struggle trials and tribulations and today people irrespective of age and gender are out on the streets giving open vent to their yearning for freedom
6939676 this should be an eye opener for the forces and elements who indulge in propaganda of normalcy and peace
6939677 like the people all pro freedom leaders are united and it is with unity that we can carry the blood nourished movement to its logical conclusion
6939678 though we are a small nation our will and determination are towering no amount of force and violence can suppress the iron will of a people
6939679 this movement is a continuation of the plebiscite campaign and the kashmiri people will accept nothing less
6939680 the united nations should accept the current movement as a referendum and ensure the implementation of the resolutions passed in connection with the kashmir issue
6939681 unity is important but unity can be successful only when based on principles
6939682 the right of self determination should be the basis of unity and anything less than that can jeopardize the process
6939683 i know she dont want to hear it kelly you know my condolences
6939684 she was murdered and you are responsible from the evidence its clear that sarah lunde did not have an easy life but it was her life and you chose to end that life and for that you deserve the maximum punishment
6939685 i reject out of hand completely the idea that i should take into account cultural differences
6939686 this gentleman is not a predatory manipulative child sex abuser
6939687 as repugnant as it may be to us in some parts of the world no one turns an eye when someone is walking around with someone who looks like his daughter as a date
6939688 ive had this self centered streak that has caused me to be where i am
6939689 got picked to be on the tv show my redneck wedding a big event taught you would like to come and get the juicy details she has
6939690 the wedding will take place in the midst of one of billy bobs hunting excursions with his groomsmen and will feature them unchanged from their camouflage for the event preferably covered in pheasant blood
6939691 the shows involvement in their wedding has helped alleviate a variety of wedding costs through sponsorships with wal mart kmart skoal copenhagen jack daniels realtree suttys a local mini mart alexanders guns and ammo and toms hardware
6939692 wedding events include a dumpster full of nickelodeon slime mudwrestling and boar rides
6939693 in the methodist church nothing goes on the altar it just isnt appropriate
6939694 well they cant go over here because no one will see them
6939695 given her experience and energy rayna will provide a vital link between students young people and the greens

6939736 everyone thought the age of dragons had vanished but it is only just begun
6939737 makes a lot of points here that could be and should be made in virginia not the least of which is that principles count more than personalities if only hed run for president
6939738 the democrats i spoke with started to sound like a broken record they all criticized governor mark sanford and they all called him the same thing a libertarian
6939739 its not just democrats either sanford is a member of the republican party but youd hardly know from talking to a lot of people in south carolina newspaper columnists and political scientists often describe him as a libertarian
6939740 to a point all of these people are simply trying to describe sanfords philosophy
6939741 what i cant decide is whether this line of attack is effective
6939742 sanford for one doesnt seem too worried about the term
6939743 and sometimes accused of being a libertarian to which i say im guilty i love liberty
6939744 diminish the appearance of 50 90 of fine lines and wrinkles instantly
6939745 in this case it is not because of market downturn it is because the company has decided to act in its self interest at the expense of the workforce and the community
6939746 we think that this company needs to be held to account by government
6939747 if you want to make real inroads into the damage caused by poker machines you cant trust the states because theyre raking in that 4 billion a year in pokies taxes
6939748 you wish i was jk rowling she is the richest author ever i think if i became that you would benefit
6939749 really what would that change i guess we would have a bigger house but i wouldnt get a single extra special treat
6939750 directs the pentagon to shed some of its large well equipped bases in favor of smaller simpler ones in far flung locations
6939751 were talking about the ability of our forces to operate when and where they are needed
6939752 we have found it increasingly difficult and politically costly to maintain bases
6939753 we could use it for six months turn off the lights and go to another base if we need to
6939754 we dont want to be stepping all over our host nations
6939755 is that for domestic political reasons it would be difficult to give the appearance that the united states is reestablishing its bases
6939756 we are adapting our plans and cooperation of the past to the future
6939757 those plans do not include any request by the united states for bases in the philippines of the kind that we have had in the past
6939758 everyone has the right to live in his own country
6939759 the characteristic form of us power outside its territory is not colonial or indirect rule within a colonial framework of direct control but a system of satellite or compliant states
6939760 it is never our intention to go and stay in a place and to impose our will by the presence of our military forces
6939761 we will stay as long as necessary to make sure that the iraqi people have a government of by and for the iraqi people and then well come home
6939762 we have no desire to stay any longer than necessary
6939763 i assured iraqis that america wasnt leaving when they hear me say were staying that means were staying
6939764 i cant say whether it is going to be 2006 2007 it is not going to be months for sure
6939765 as a proud and independent people iraqis do not support an indefinite occupation and neither does america
6939766 we have no intention at the present time of putting permanent bases in iraq

6939777 just about everyone but google simply does not want to spend the money to invest in the security of their users and will continue to ignore this issue just as they have for the past year
6939778 any society that would give up a little liberty to gain a little security will deserve neither and lose both

6939800 ive seen the auditor generals report and the rural communities impact statement
6939801 were considering both those documents but im not impressed at this stage
6939802 in fact the auditor general is recommending that this issue be held over until such time as the national emissions trading scheme details are known
6939803 so this urgency from morris iemma simply doesnt stack up
6939804 morris iemma is spinning as many positives as he can find to justify this policy
6939805 what its really about though is his own political neck hes desperate to save himself
6939806 the people he ought to be listening to really are the community whose really concerned by this proposal
6939807 we would have loved to provide ample warning to network creators about this decision the difficulty is that im not sure there would have been a way for us to do so that didnt violate the privacy of parties involved
6939808 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing and squishing and everything

6939811 very many people are still not aware that there is a global sanitation crisis
6939812 policy makers and opinion leaders have never suffered the lack of adequate sanitation and if they have it is too long ago to remember the undignified inhumane circumstances these people use a fancy toilet which is connected to an effective sewer system and they are probably unaware that this toilet and its flushing system are critical to a healthy life unsgab will continue to call a spade a spade or perhaps i should say a toilet a toilet
6939813 the financial aspect should and can not be a barrier
6939814 since rural sanitation is not specifically identified in the eu directives
6939815 often new member states have no resources left to allocate to this issue

6939855 truth eludes us if we do not concentrate with total attention on its pursuit
6939856 i think the black people would say he obama dont talk act or carry himself as a black person
6939857 even though the black society would pull for him i still think that they think in the back of their mind that the only reason he is in the general election is because he talks acts and carries himself as a caucasian
6939858 creative insights come at odd and unpredictable moments not when you have all the references spread out on the table in front of you you cant possibly hope to have creative insights unless you have memorized all the relevant information and you cant hope to have really creative insights unless you have memorized a vast amount of information because you have no way of knowing what might turn out to be useful

6939873 when a toshiba pa3383u 1brs battery is discharged an electrochemical oxidation reaction proceeds at the negative electrode and an electrochemical reduction reaction occurs at the positive electrode
6939874 in the case of the rechargeable battery the electrochemical oxidation reduction reactions are reversible at both electrodes in the case of the non rechargeable battery when one attempts to recharge the pa3383u 1brs battery by reversing the direction of electron current flow at least one of the electrochemical oxidation reduction reactions is not reversible
6939875 does this represent an overall shift in strategy do they have to find a new path to 270 electoral votes does this represent a sign of things to come in other states is the obama campaign planning to close down offices in states they have initially targeted

6939877 traditional down in the mud politics would bring the american system of getting a new president to respect and decency and he would also be a transparent and

6939886 agencies incur a significant legal risk if they continue to call unauthorized cell phones
6939887 but removing cell phone numbers from all dialing pools creates a likely drop in productivity and collections without this solution from ontario systems collection agencies are in a very difficult position
6939888 this product is far superior to any other solution for this potentially damaging ruling
6939889 it allows our clients to remain 100 percent in compliance while still maintaining their productivity levels

6939903 the withdrawal of russian forces has gone without incident and was concluded according to plan at 19 50 moscow time
6939904 the pullback of russian troops and units passed without incident and was completed on time
6939905 russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
6939906 if needed we reserve the right to boost these forces
6939907 i do not believe that these actions can seriously contribute to the stabilisation of the situation in the region
6939908 we are demonstrating that everyone will be held to account we didnt just target junior staff and that sends a very clear signal
6939909 cia has made its own inquiries overseas and no one no individual and no intelligence service has substantiated suskinds account of habbush or the bogus letter
6939910 at this point the origins of the forgery like the whereabouts of habbush himself remain unclear but this much is certain suskind is off the mark
6939911 theres not a shred of doubt about any of it
6939912 to state what should be obvious it is not the policy or practice of this agency to violate american law
6939913 it is ridiculous to think that the white house would give me such an order and even more ridiculous to think that i would carry it out
6939914 consistently fought with some administration officials to prevent them from overstating the case for iraqi involvement in international terrorism
6939915 i feel so honoured to be given this role and really looking forward to it because i didnt get to go to the opening ceremony
6939916 i was always looking forward to going to the closing but now even more so
6939917 weve had a lot of wonderful performances in this team but stephanie stood out
6939918 its a recognition of her sensational performance in winning two individual gold medals and a relay event in the swimming in the first week
6939919 all of that was very very important for the encouragement and setting the mood for our team as a whole and the performance of the swimmers in winning 20 medals
6939920 believes it is proper to kill a baby that has survived an abortion
6939921 wants the doctors chasing it through the delivery room to make sure it gets killed
6939922 i n leaving born babies to die without treatment christ hospital was doing nothing illegal under the laws of illinois
6939923 w hat they were alleging were violations of existing law we took the allegations very seriously
6939924 shafer told me that the 1999 investigation reviewed logs personnel files and medical records
6939925 because what they were alleging were violations of existing law
6939926 the allegation that infants were allowed to expire in a utility room could not be substantiated and all staff interviewed denied that any infant was ever left alone
6939927 this is not true such measures were not already the law in illinois not according to the department of public health not according to attorney general ryan
6939928 s uch measures were not already the law in illinois
6939929 but in the illinois senate when mr obama chaired the health and human services committee records show a bill consisting of exactly the same language two years later was voted down by six to four mr obama was one of the legislators opposing it
6939930 sen barbara boxer d calif does not share his obamas position in 2001 just three months after obama inveighed against protecting premature babies in illinois the united states senate voted on the language of the born alive infants protection act it contained no significant legal differences from the illinois bill but it did contain even more specific and redundant language stating that the bill did not apply to the unborn only those already born
6939931 but in case there is any ambiguity the federal bill was identical word for word to the bill that obama voted to kill two years later in the illinois senate health committee which he chaired
6939932 the enactment of hb 984 did not negatively impact access to abortion services in illinois and medical care for pregnant women remains protected

6939936 you have senator obama who comes from a midwestern state illinois he understand agriculture and how important it is john mccain voted against the farm bill
6939937 after being informed of the reasons for northwest airlines objections
6939938 only you can win this this is a generational change going on in america
6939939 the message that your generation has brought to us is please stop fighting about those things that you disagree on and start reaching out to everybody and fix the things that you can agree on
6939940 i think people in rural america have been really hurt by the bush mccain economic policies
6939941 if you dont know how many houses you own how can you deal with affordable housing
6939942 i thought it was going to be just a boring old stage but this is so much cooler
6939943 just wait till you see the shots of the mountains
6939944 were glad to be here for the flipping of the switch
6939945 do you know how noisy this room will be on monday night
6939946 theyre really excited for me to be able to come
6939947 the driver told me the vehicle got in his lane and he tried to avoid a collision and went to his right and lost control
6939948 i proved to the u s dot that i had new brakes on that bus i was able to show them using invoices
6939949 no i dont think its misleading because i dont have any kind of advertising in houston
6939950 as a matter of fact no one knew i existed in houston until the accident
6939951 i guess people keep working further north as work in the south declines
6939952 theyre going up north where the work is more plentiful and paid at a better rate

6939956 on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
6939957 by the time i met him he was a professor of education at the university of illinois we served on a board together that had republicans bankers lawyers focused on education
6939958 would likely murder men simply because they appeared to be latino or african american
6939959 when a city is violating federal law and that violation of law leads to horrific consequences like this then the city has clearly acted in a negligent manner

6939961 my goal with this entry is to brush a big picture of where linux stands as far as photography is concerned
6939962 los estados unidos apoya al gobierno democr ticamente elegido de georgia insistimos que se respete la soberan a y la integridad territorial de georgia
6939963 frente a la agresi n rusa la existencia de una georgia independiente y la sobrevivencia de su gobierno democr ticamente elegido est n en riesgo
6939964 l a onu debe respaldar la soberan a de sus miembros y apoyar la paz en el mundo
6939965 los estados unidos no est satisfecho de ver a ning n pa s peor aun a rusia como un poder econ mico o pol tico en el mundo
6939966 rusia tiene derecho a defenderse y el derecho de estar preocupada de la intromisi n de los estados unidos en las ex rep blicas sovi ticas ser miembro de la otan es ser parte de la alianza imperialista estadounidense y una amenaza a la paz mundial
6939967 el bombardeo mat a civiles stianos a nuestras hermanas y nuestros hermanos ni os mujeres y anciano tambi n murieron cientos de civiles de nacionalidad georgiana tanto en la zona de conflicto como en todo el territorio de georgia el comit por la paz de georgia luchara para que los que organizaron este monstruoso genocidio reciban un castigo severo y legitimo
6939968 el compromiso de bush de respaldar al presidente saakashvili para que georgia sea admitida a la otan es como clavar una navaja fila en el coraz n de rusia por su propia iniciativa saakashvili nunca se hubiera aventurado a desplegar al ej rcito georgiano a osetia del sur no se puede jugar con la guerra nuclear ni premiar el suministro de carne de ca n para el mercado
6939969 i was not expecting anything like this i thought it was going to be a few girls from the gym and coaches
6939970 2012 isnt out of the question right now but im taking it one day at a time
6939971 when you think about the six seven cars that are still battling that out eight cars maybe those eight cars are in a position where finishing 12th is way better than finishing 38th
6939972 you dont want to go out there and risk running out of fuel or anything but theres not a lot you can do here
6939973 a lot of the wrecks that you end up finding yourselves in here are because of something that happened two or three cars ahead of you
6939974 i need you to be at the finish line when i get done i want you to be there so that we can have pictures and so that we can celebrate together
6939975 i think i did very very well im very pleased with my score of course im pleased with the medal im pleased with the title that comes with the medal im just happy everything worked out
6939976 any time one of the guys in the decathlon is injured or doesnt do well or is laid out your heart goes out to them because you know exactly what theyre going through
6939977 those are all the guys that i look up to we still go back into the books and look at all the things that theyve accomplished and the things that theyve done
6939978 its been a little while since weve had the olympic gold medal in the decathlon brought back to the states so im happy to be the person to do it id love to bring the decathlon back to the forefront of track and field
6939979 i started the day pretty tired as everyone does i didnt fall and i had an ok time so ill take it
6939980 it was long its my first olympics and my first international experience really im not used to the all day schedule we were the first ones out here this morning and the last ones to leave
6939981 i gave up the second most important job in government for eight long years as roosevelts spare tire
6939982 the office until recently was completely meaningless in every way
6939983 its almost inevitable we keep seeing this growth of power
6939984 whoever the pick is will have a significant role as a strategist in terms of what the administration should do politically as an attack dog to go and say things the president might not be able to say and finally in terms of a policy maker
6939985 folks who dont get along during primary campaigns or people who are competitors can still be on each others ticket it tells you that
6939986 johnson hates kennedy johnson wants to be president that was kennedys effort to bridge the regional division in the party south and north the boston austin connection
6939987 it was a model of a successful partnership where it really enhanced the ticket allowed kennedy to win and achieve more prominence in the south than otherwise would have been possible
6939988 my ambition since my senior year in high school was to be a senator not everybody achieves their ambition i got to the level that i really had no great right to claim
6939989 walter mondale takes the biggest role that we had seen for a vice president and really starts to play a big role in policy in part because carter was unknown in congress and not liked and mondale was liked
